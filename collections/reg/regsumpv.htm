<h3><a id="intro" name="intro"></a>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The meeting resulted from a series of bilateral discussions
about "registry services", in particular, those that are used to
record information about the existence and availability of
digitized books journals.</p>

<p>These discussions generated great deal of interest,
particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the costs that libraries could potentially avoid if such
registry services were in place (e.g. redundant digitization</li>

<li>in the new services and service functions that libraries
could potentially supply by reallocating even a fraction of the
avoided costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meeting was hosted by the DLF which expressed an interest
in developing a registry service to some prototype stage if a
compelling case could be made for that investment either in terms
of cost avoidance, new service, etc.</p>

<p>The meeting opened with a <i>tour de table</i>during which
participants outlined their views and preferences about what a
registry service might be expected to achieve. The discussion
lasted the better part of the day and achieved consensus at key
points about the primary aims that should guide the construction
of the service and the various benefits its existence might
bestow.</p>

<p>In light of this consensus and of the potential benefits seen
in a registry service, participants agreed to five further steps
that should be taken to develop the registry and hoped the steps
could be taken in an 8- or 12-week period.</p>

<p>Rather than following discussion chronologically, this report
is organized thematically under the following heads.</p>

<h3><a id="aims" name="aims"></a>2. Statement of aims</h3>

<p>"A service that records information about digitized books and
journals may be a key infrastructural part or utility in an
evolving network of organizations and services that support the
efficient and responsible stewardship of our cultural heritage,
all formats, old and new, and the economical and effective
development of high-quality scholarly collections."</p>

<h3><a id="chief" name="chief"></a>3. Chief characteristics of a
registry service</h3>

<ul>
<li>Records information about digital surrogates (whether in
existence or about to be created) for books and journals (in all
languages and on all topics), that is for objects that are
collected redundantly by libraries</li>

<li>By recording information about a digital object in a registry
service, an individual or institution records their intention to
ensure that the digital object persists.</li>

<li>Digital objects referenced in the service must be available
to users, that is, accessible. The objects need not be freely
accessible.</li>

<li>Terms and conditions of access must be recorded for
information referenced in the registry service according to some
agreed mechanism.</li>

<li>Records in the registry service must include a persistent
link to a "use-copy" of the relevant digital object. Where
archival master copies exist, they will be indicated in the
record but need not be accessible</li>

<li>Rather than prescribe minimum requirements pertaining to the
characteristics of digital objects that are referenced in a
registry service, (e.g. formats, terms and conditions of use,
etc), the service will simply implement agreement about how to
record such information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The service as described will act as key infrastructure. It is
not intended to offer end-user services. Rather, its existence
will potentially encourage the development of a wide range of
end-user services which may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>content services that aggregate or otherwise leverage off of
existing digital content</li>

<li>print-on-demand services</li>

<li>copyright clearance services</li>
</ul>

<p>The service is seen as one piece of key service infrastructure
that exists within and must inevitably interoperate with other
key pieces of service infrastructure including:</p>

<ul>
<li>catalogues of books</li>

<li>microfilm registries</li>

<li>print repositories</li>

<li>digital repositories</li>

<li>digitization services</li>
</ul>

<p>The service as defined is deemed to be a starting point. Its
limitations are intended to focus effort in a way that will allow
us to assess key assumptions and technologies with a definable
set of information content. It is conceivable that such a service
could be extended to include audio-visual and other non-unique
materials.</p>

<h3><a id="uses" name="uses">4. Uses of a registry
service</a></h3>

<p>The registry service would enable institutions to:</p>

<ul>
<li>locate information and potentially access digitized books and
journals</li>

<li>avoid redunant digitization effort</li>

<li>co-ordinate digitization efforts (e.g. by divvying up
responsibility for digitizating a common body of materials)</li>

<li>co-ordinate print deposit/preservation effort</li>

<li>support economical institution-level collection development
decisions viz 

<ul>
<li>acquisition / disposition of printed materials</li>

<li>digitization of books and journals</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>support a range of end-user services</li>

<li>identify collaborative opportunities</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="other" name="other"></a>5. Other benefits/uses</h3>

<p>These include its:</p>

<ul>
<li>support for incremental development/improvement of existing
digital objects</li>

<li>formal disclosure of preservation practice as it evolves and
support for ancillary community discussion and debate about what
constitutes good practice</li>

<li>cross-fertilization with commercial data producers and
suppliers who, as contributors to and users of the registry would
be sensitized to community awareness of needs, good practices,
etc</li>

<li>Support for a range of end-user services as described
above</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="users" name="users"></a>6. Registry service users</h3>

<p>The registry would be used primarily by collection managers
(as described above) and service providers who would build
end-user services that rely on the registry's existence</p>

<h3><a id="research" name="research"></a>7. Research issues that
remain to be investigated</h3>

<ul>
<li>Strategic issues 

<ul>
<li>Costs of building/maintaining a registry (comparable data may
be available from other registry and cataloguing efforts)</li>

<li>Costs that may be avoided by libraries and others if a
registry service existed</li>

<li>How the existence of a registry service would leverage
existing investment e.g. in print collections, digitization, and
digital and print repositories</li>

<li>Models for organizing and sustaining a registry service</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Metadata issues 

<ul>
<li>Collection level descriptions; their structure and possible
use in a registry service</li>

<li>How to describe an intention to ensure persistence of a
digital object that is referenced in the registry</li>

<li>What granularity for registry entries (journals will be
particularly challenging)?</li>

<li>How will the registry make it possible to update records, for
example to reflect changes in access or preservation copies of
the digital content?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Other issues 

<ul>
<li>How is information in the registry accessed?</li>

<li>What inter-relationship exists between information about
digital surrogates as recorded in the registry and information
about print and microfilm editions as recorded in bibliographic
and microfilm catalogues and registries respectively</li>

<li>Does the registry include references to digitized
newspapers?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="next" name="next"></a>8. Next steps</h3>

<p>It is anticipated that these steps can be taken within 8-12
weeks</p>

<ol>
<li>Develop a brief and compelling summary statement describing
aims, goals, and potential of a registry service. The case can be
used to generate buy in/enthusiasm/etc amongst key stake-holding
groups. Some of the elements of a supporting case for a registry
(including indication in parentheses of those who may be most
swayed by those elements) are indicated below 

<ul>
<li>Leveraging existing investment in digital content (libraries
and their owners)</li>

<li>Helping to rethink collection development and management
costs (library managers and their owners)</li>

<li>Helping more economically to re-think preservation /
persistence strategies (library managers)</li>

<li>Maximum value for funds spent on digitization (funding
agencies and others investing in digitization)</li>

<li>Key infrastructural component of national print and digital
preservation strategies (information producers, information
users, and repository managers /libraries)</li>

<li>Key support for a new generation of end-user information
services (information users but also information providers and
libraries)</li>

<li>Exploration of costs involved in doing nothing; that is, in
continuing as we are (all)</li>

<li>Professional development/training and awareness-raising</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Expert workshop develops a detailed functional specification
for the registry service as defined above. This work should by a
commissioned review of Michigan's Making of Americas records as
currently recorded in OCLC. The review would ask what more would
the OCLC service have to do to support the registry functions
outlined above.</li>

<li>Approach made to OCLC to discuss possible role for OCLC
developing a registry service.</li>

<li>Expert workshop documents the extended metadata set required
by the registry, mechanisms and incentives for creating and
supplying those metadata, and discusses issues of granularity,
metadata updating, etc as recorded above.</li>

<li>Expert meeting to review existing preservation reformatting
guidelines with a view to identifying agreed benchmark practices
if possible. The review should include institutions with such
guidelines in hand including Cornell, JSTOR, Harvard, Library of
Congress, University of Virginia, University of Michigan,
California Digital Library, RLG, University of Chicago, Indiana
University, University of Wisconsin, Yale University. The review
might also include Jerry McDonough (New York University) and
McKenzie Smith (Harvard) who are currently developing a dtd for
technical, administrative and structural metadata.</li>
