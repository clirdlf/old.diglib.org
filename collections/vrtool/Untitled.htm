<h2>Shared Cataloguing Tool for Visual Resources</h2>

<h4>Report of a focus group meetingon functional requirements
Convened at ARLIS/NA Annual Conference, Getty Research Institute,
Sunday April 1, 2001 1:00-4:00 pm</h4>

<p>This was the final of three meetings on the topic of a shared
cataloging utility or service for the VR community. Sponsored by
the DLF, these meetings have envisioned the strategic development
of a service that will facilitate and promote the shared
development of high-quality, consistent, reliable, and
professionally developed descriptions of visual resources. DLF
has been prepared to invest in a prototype development in 2001
should these meetings indicate that such a development is
desirable, feasible, and cost-effective.</p>

<p><b>Attending</b>: Max Marmor (DLF/Yale and presiding); Murtha
Baca (Getty); Linda Barnhart (UCSD); Brett Carnell (LC); Sherman
Clarke (NYU); Michael Ester (Luna); Elisa Lanzi (Smith); Vicki
O'Riordan ((UCSD); Bill Parod (Northwestern/Dun Huang project);
Barbara Rockenbach (Yale and recorder); James Shulman (by phone;
Mellon); Chris Sundt (U Oregon); Ann Whiteside (Harvard GSD);
Greg Zick (U Washington)</p>

<p>Max reviewed previous discussions of the need for and
feasibility of developing a prototype shared cataloging utility
for VR collections. He summarized the results of two previous
DLF-sponsored meetings on this subject (22 Jan 2001 at NYU, 1
March 2001 at the VRA annual conference). <b>He defined the
purpose of this final focus group meeting as 1) to test, revise
as appropriate, or affirm the understandings arrived at in the
previous meetings and 2) to update those understandings in view
of a major development, the likely adoption of this initiative by
the Mellon Foundation as part of its nascent ArtSTOR imaging
initiative.</b></p>

<h4>ArtSTOR</h4>

<p>Max briefly reviewed the genesis of ArtSTOR, its relationship
to a planned art history phase of JSTOR, and its likely
development trajectory. His summary was amplified and expanded
upon by James Shulman, who has been appointed executive director
of ArtSTOR and who participated in the meeting via speakerphone.
Discussion revolved around the project's likely advisory
structure and the possible role(s) of a shared cataloging tool
within ArtSTOR. [Press releases concerning ArtSTOR appeared
shortly after this meeting, alleviating the need to summarize in
detail this part of the discussion here.]</p>

<h4>Focus group issues</h4>

<p>Max then summarized the shared cataloging utility discussion
to date, emphasizing these accomplishments:</p>

<ul>
<li>successful identification of <b>ArtSTOR as a likely
administrative host</b> providing central support and ownership
(compare Getty as a home for the Getty vocabularies)</li>

<li>successful identification of candidate institutional
<b>contributors of more than 500K cataloging records</b> for a
prototype development. <i>Contributed descriptions should be
stored in their native formats and presented both in their native
formats and in a unifying view (to be developed) based on VRA
Core 3.0</i></li>

<li>successful preliminary identification of the most desirable
<b>authority tools</b> for incorporation into a prototype VR
"Catalogers Desktop" comparable to the LC Catalogers Desktop.
Candidates: AAT, ULAN, TGN, Iconclass, LCNAF, LCSH</li>
</ul>

<p>These accomplishments, especially the identification of
ArtSTOR as the service's likely administrative home, allow DLF to
set aside for now several unresolved issues for resolution in the
specific context of ArtSTOR's own development.</p>

<p>Issues "off the table" for include:</p>

<ul>
<li>need to identify an organizational <b>home</b></li>

<li>need to define in the very near term a <b>provisional "work
record" structure</b> to which records in native formats can be
mapped for presentation in a common "unifying view" within a
prototype</li>

<li>need to <b>prioritize candidate contributors</b> of
cataloging records for further negotiations and prototype
development</li>

<li>need to <b>prioritize authority tools</b> for a prototype
development</li>

<li>need to address the development of a <b>prototype
software</b></li>

<li>need to model the <b>cost</b> of prototyping such a
service</li>
</ul>

<p>Remaining "on the table" for purposes of this meeting were the
following process issues, and the group was asked to provide a
"reality check" on present assumptions about these issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>need for better understanding of potential <b>audiences and
uses</b></li>

<li>need for better understanding of <b>administrative
maintenance issues</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>Audience(s)</h4>

<p>The catalog service will have a number of direct benefits for
<b>VR catalogers</b> and slide and art librarians. It will:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>reduce redundant cataloging effort</i> by providing a
central repository of shared records</li>

<li><i>encourage, facilitate, and provide examples of good
cataloging practice</i></li>

<li><i>ensure convergence of and leverage complementary but
fragmented streams of activity within the VR community</i> e.g.
on controlled vocabularies, community metadata formats,
application guidelines, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Other audiences: The group affirmed that the service may
similarly benefit scholars, teaches and students, as well as
curators outside VR narrowly defined (archivists, art librarians,
library catalogers, museum professionals). Linda Barnhart
observed (to general concurrence) that this development presents
an opportunity to rethink the very nature of shared cataloging as
it is generally understood in the library community, precisely
because this development arises at a moment when distributed
technologies offer new opportunities for addressing the need for
collaboration.</p>

<h4>Users and uses</h4>

<p><b>Levels</b> of use and responsibility:</p>

<p>The service will permit different <b>levels of use</b>
including the following</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Level 1. Users will be able to search, browse, and export
records</b> (e.g. for printing labels, populating local catalog
databases, or supplying links to authoritative records in the
catalog)</li>

<li><b>Level 2. Level 1 functions plus ability to add descriptive
records to the service and to recommend candidate authority
terms.</b> Added descriptions may provide supplemental material
for works for which descriptions already exist. Alternatively
they may supply records for new works. Level 2 users may also
submit candidate authority terms for existing or newly created
descriptions.</li>

<li>Level 3. <b>Level 2 functions plus ability to approve and
implement authority terms, which will be conveyed by system
administrators to producers of authority tools employed by the
service..</b> In this respect, at least some level 3 users might
serve as members of specialist editorial panels or review bodies
and take responsibility for reviewing and approving candidate
authority terms submitted for review by level 2 users</li>

<li>Level 4. <b>System administrator</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Affirmed by the group as appropriate.</p>

<p><b>Tools</b> to support these levels of use:</p>

<p>The service will include a range of <b>administrative
tools</b> with which service administrators and authorized users
can, as appropriate, amend, enhance, and normalize existing
descriptive records according to agreed-upon guidelines. Tools
will also allow users to create and add new descriptions
according to approved guidelines, and to adapt and otherwise
employ descriptions in local use.</p>

<p><b>Administrative tools</b> must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>tools allowing service administrators and other authorized
users to cluster descriptions that refer to a single "work"</li>

<li>tools enabling service administrators and other authorized
users to <i>upload collections of image descriptions in their
native formats</i> for integration into the service</li>

<li>tools enabling service administrators to <i>generate from
records in various native formats a presentation record in the
to-be-developed unifying "view"</i></li>

<li>tools enabling service administrators and users to <i>attach
via download or link to thumbnail images</i> and/or
web-accessible images where such images are considered to be key
descriptive elements ("visual metadata")</li>
</ul>

<p><b>User tools</b> must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>tools enabling users to <i>search and browse</i> descriptions
and to cluster descriptions that refer to the same work</li>

<li>tools enabling users to <i>repurpose, edit, amend, and
enhance</i> existing records for local use, including <i>pick
lists</i> that assist in the selection and application of
<i>controlled vocabularies and other authorities</i></li>

<li>tools that allow users to <i>output records for local
use</i>, e.g. as printed labels, in standard file formats for
inclusion in a local catalog database, as links to authoritative
records in the catalog</li>

<li>tools allowing users to recommend candidate terms for review
by some approved editorial board</li>
</ul>

<p>Affirmed by the group as appropriate.</p>

<h4>Addenda to agenda</h4>

<p>After the meeting concluded, Michael Ester demonstrated the
work Luna Imaging has been doing on cross-collection searching
for its forthcoming release of Insight 3.0. This feature works by
resolving the metadata model employed for any given collection
against one of a handful of standards (Dublin Core, MARC, VRA
Core 3.0, etc.). The user can view collection metadata in native
format or in any of these standard "views."</p>

<p>Greg Zick then demonstrated the CONTENT software developed at
the University of Washington for digital asset management. The
CONTENT website is at <a
href="http://contentdm.com">http://contentdm.com</a> and a 60 day
trial subscription is available. <!-- End text -->
