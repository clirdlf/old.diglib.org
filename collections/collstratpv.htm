<h2>Strategies for developing sustainable and scaleable digital
library collections</h2>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>This document outlines a DLF initiative that aims to assemble,
review and document practices adopted by libraries in developing
their digital collections. The initiative envisages a publication
series with commissioned titles that may focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the design and development of local digitization projects
that produce surrogates for analogue information objects;</li>

<li>the design and development of data creation projects that
produce information resources that have no analogue equivalent
and are in this respect "born digital";</li>

<li>the selection of existing third-party data resources for
inclusion in a collection either through their outright
acquisition or by acquiring access under some licensing
arrangement; and</li>

<li>the development of Internet gateways comprising locally
maintained pages or databases of web-links to third-party
networked information</li>
</ul>

<p>The initiative also envisages the production of planning and
development tools, for example, copyright clearance guidelines,
template licenses, and outline work-flow plans.</p>

<p>Titles and associated planning and development tools that deal
with digitization projects and with selection of existing
third-party data resources are likely to be given priority.</p>

<p>Where possible, publications will recommend the good or even
best practice that emerge from review. Still, they are intended
to inform local decision-making rather than to prescribe local
practice. In this respect, they are intended as starting points
for the development of procedures that are appropriate to an
institution's specific collection development aims and
capacities.</p>

<p>The initiative springs from a wide and growing recognition of
the medium- and long-term support and other costs that are
associated with decisions to develop, acquire, or acquire access
to digital information resources and to include those resources
within a library's increasingly virtual collection. It reflects,
indeed builds upon the numerous guidelines that are beginning to
emerge within libraries as one means of reducing those costs or
at least making them somewhat more predictable. In attempting to
assemble and synthesize the work represented in these guidelines,
it seeks leverage from the effort that went into their production
and to share their combined expertise with the broadest possible
community.</p>

<p>This document outlines a problem statement that defines the
initiative's aims and objectives and recommends a number of
concrete next steps.</p>

<h3>2. Problem statement and next steps</h3>

<h4>2.1. Define a problem statement</h4>

<p>A draft problem statement is supplied here.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Decisions taken when creating a digital information resource
(e.g. about its contents, format, data model, level of
description, etc.) impact directly upon how, at what cost, and by
whom that resource can be used, integrated into collections,
maintained, and supported. A somewhat more constrained set of
ramifications stem from decisions taken to include third-party
data resources into existing digital collections (whether by
acquiring those resources outright or by acquiring access to them
under some form of licensing arrangement).</p>

<p>One consequence for libraries that assemble digital
collections from locally produced and third party data is a need
for formal review procedures that help assess and cost the full
ramifications of its decisions to create, acquire, or acquire
access to a digital resource. Such procedures are both well known
and well documented where paper-based and analogue materials are
concerned. For those formats, review may emphasize potential use
(demand), cost, and fit with existing holdings. Review may also
take account of medium- and long-term storage, maintenance, and
access requirements (especially with rare and special collections
and with analogue materials such as sound, film, and video
recordings) as well as any special conservation or preservation
needs.</p>

<p>Although the same high-level concerns may govern assessment of
a digital resource, detailed evaluation will differ considerably
than that which applies to more traditional formats particularly
where information access and maintenance issues are concerned.
Here, the rate and pace of technical change, the volatility of
digital media, and the implications that access licenses have for
collection development and use forces fundamentally new kinds of
review that concentrates, for example, on:</p>

<ul>
<li>hardware, software, and networking environments required to
provide access a resource including investigation into the
stability, maintenance, and potential migration of such
environments;</li>

<li>copyright and licensing issues and any associated system
requirements e.g. maintenance of secure environments, charging
mechanisms, etc.;</li>

<li>methods and costs involved in maintaining access to a
resource over the medium- and longer terms;</li>

<li>development and provision of appropriate user support
services; and</li>

<li>the costs involved in accessioning a data resource into a
collection, a process that may itself include data reformatting,
metadata creation or amendment, systems design or modification,
development of any documentation that may be required by end
users, public service librarians, systems librarians, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formal review of potential data accessions takes on even
greater significance for libraries and other organizations that
have an interest in developing large-scale digital collections.
Increasingly such organizations seek "core" technologies and
services that promise, through their common application across a
range of heterogeneous data resources, to integrate access to and
the administration of such resources. Here the review process
furnishes evidence not only of the likely costs involved in
integrating a data resource into an existing collection but also
of the viability of evolving core technologies and services.</p>

<p>Formal review procedures are as critical given the
departmental organization of most libraries. Where digital
resources are concerned at any rate, collection development
decisions may have substantial impact on the work of departments
concerned cataloguing, licensing and administration, public
service and user support, and with library systems. Formal review
procedures help to predict those impacts and in this respect act
as a substantial aid in work-flow management. They may also
mitigate against having to involve professional departments
across the library in review of every data resource that may be
considered for inclusion in a collection.</p>

<p>Naturally, the need for formal review procedures that can be
applied in the development of digital collection has surfaced a
variety of practices. These are typically available at an
institutional level as guidelines that aid selectors,
bibliographers, digital library professionals and others engaged
in the development of digital collections. This publication
series seeks to assemble, review and document existing practices
and, where possible, to recommend the good or even best practices
that emerge from that review. It is envisaged as a series rather
than as a single publication in order that it may take account of
the very different approaches that may be required in:</p>

<ul>
<li>the design and development of local digitization projects
that create digital surrogates for information objects in some
paper-based or other analogue format;</li>

<li>the design and development of data creation projects that
produce information resources that have no analogue equivalent
and are in this respect "born digital";</li>

<li>the selection of existing third-party data resources for
inclusion in a collection either through their outright
acquisition or by acquiring access under some licensing
arrangement; and</li>

<li>the development of Internet gateways comprising locally
maintained pages or databases of web-links to third-party
networked information resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>The initiative also envisages the production of planning and
development tools, for example, copyright clearance guidelines,
template licenses, and outline work-flow plans.</p>

<p>Titles and associated planning and development tools that deal
deal with digitization projects and with selection of existing
third-party data resources are likely to be given priority.</p>

<p>The guidelines are intended to inform local decision-making
rather than to prescribe practice. In this respect, they are
intended as a starting point for the development of review
procedures that are appropriate to an institution's specific
collection development aims and capacities.</p>

<p>Clearly, the library needs ultimately to allocate its limited
acquisitions budget effectively across a range of very different
information resources including those listed above but also the
more traditional paper-based and analogue formats. In this
respect, it needs collection development policies that assist it
in weighing the relative costs, benefits, and values that may be
associated with these very different resource types. Although the
guidelines intended for publication in this series will not
supply that policy framework, they will, it is hoped, provide
building blocks that are essential in its production.</p>

<h4>2.2. Assemble an advisory body comprising experts in the
development of digital library collections</h4>

<p>An advisory body may help to:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify appropriate authors;</li>

<li>identify existing guidelines and relevant publications;</li>

<li>consult with authors in the preparation of outline
publications and in review of publication drafts; and</li>

<li>make recommendations to the DLF with regard to any
endorsement it might give to publications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Participation in any advisory body may require e-mail
exchanges (e.g. to help identify potential authors, develop an
inventory of existing practice) and a small number of conference
calls and/or face-to-face meetings to review both outline and
draft publications.</p>

<p>The project is unlikely to run for more than 12 months.</p>

<h4>2.3. Commission titles from specific authors</h4>

<h4>2.4. Develop an inventory of existing practices</h4>

<p>Such practice may be available in local guidelines,
publications, etc. The following materials in particular may be
sought in the first instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selection criteria that are used to evaluate third-party
(typically commercial) digital information resources.</li>

<li>Licensing guidelines and licensing templates that may govern
discussion with third-party data suppliers.</li>

<li>"Re-selection" criteria that govern the selection of
paper-based and analogue items for inclusion in locally produced
digital collections and the work-flow, project design, copyright
clearance and other tools that govern production of such
collections.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.5. Authors prepare and advisory board reviews outlines for
individual publications</h4>

<h4>2.6. Authors prepare and advisory board reviews draft
