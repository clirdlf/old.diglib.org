<p>Following introductions, Don Waters provided an overview of
the Digital Library Federation and Max Marmor provided background
on the meetings evolution. Presentations during the morning were
made by:</p>

<p>Christine Sundt on the Image Directory locator service that
provides an online catalog of art image information and related
images when provided. Initiated by a request from Getty, the
service is supported by Academic Press, a division of
Harcourt-Brace. Data is provided in digital or hard copy formats
with data mapped to template based on MARC and CDWA. Currently
database contents represent the work of 125 data providers.
Images provided are stored in low resolution, 72 dpi and can
incorporate digital watermarking or encryption. Access is
subscription based on site license basis or to individuals.
According to Christine, the web-site is being redesigned and is
not currently accessible. Image Directory is currently
negotiating with a bay area producer of scholarly information on
a new project to start in September 1999, and there is discussion
on the possible inclusion of bio-medical information and
images.</p>

<p>Jeff Cohen, Paula Behrens and Michilene Nilsen on the Society
of Architectural Historians <a href="http://www.sah.org">Image
Exchange</a> providing architectural images for non-profit and
educational use. Project is sponsored by the Society of
Architectural Historians but maintained on servers at Bryn Mawr
and Penn. Initially the site started with images of American
architectural landmarks identified in more than one of four
survey textbooks. It was subsequently expanded to include world
landmarks that were identified in more than one of three world
architecture survey courses. Images are organized and searched
according to historical time periods. Noteworthy is the limited
copyright issues as many of the images provided are the personal
work of faculty. In addition, the database includes works from
the 1905 Bannister and Fletcher publication that is no longer
under copyright. Image resolution currently based on screen of
640 X 480 with possibility of additional option for higher
resolution option. Future plans include expanding the database to
include collections based on specific periods or styles and
geographical sites.</p>

<p>Allan Kohl on <a
href="http://www.mcad.edu/AICT/index.html">Art Images for College
Teaching</a> provides art history images for educational use. The
site is divided into five specific periods organizationally based
on survey texts. Minneapolis College of Art and Design provides
server space and webmaster assistance. A concordance is provided
with each image page reflecting the images inclusion in
identified texts. Downloading of images is supported at two
different resolutions and images are also made available on photo
CD and slides.</p>

<p>Policy is one of open contribution and use as long as intent
is educational and/or non-profit.</p>

<p><b>Post-lunch discussion</b></p>

<p>Current direction appears to have been to build collection(s)
based on a corpus of survey texts, which are monument driven
using images from the public domain or with copyright
donated.</p>

<p>If this is for survey courses, then need to identify what is
needed to support that focus and to maximize access to users. To
minimize intellectual property issues best to focus on that which
is already in the public domain that would include
pre-20<sup>th</sup> century European and US prior to 1923.</p>

<p>If content is the priority then limiting the amount of data
input for each image will insure the breadth of content.</p>

<p>Suggestion was made to incorporate peer review process into
site (as has been done with physics e-print) with assistance
provided and/or solicited by experts at participating
institutions. Data submissions could be provided or input in a
specified format to insure minimum data requirements as well as
presently guidelines for data syntax. Processing controls could
then be setup to filter accordingly with images then reviewed. Is
it necessary/preferable to be able to define and therefore search
discrete collections?</p>

<p>CAA Lantern project works - are they available and in what
format? Does CAA hold the rights to these? Can these be
incorporated into the project as they represent a large
collection of images. It would be beneficial as well to
understand the process by which the original project was
organized.</p>

<p>Brief mention of areas of concern: support structures for
maintenance and infrastructure. Proposed that ongoing support
would be provided by supporting/participating institutions much
along the lines of the DLF.</p>

<p>What work is needed? A design day or days to develop database
and interface designs. Possible participants identified as
Columbia, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon with other participants
being CAA, the three group members who have agreed to working on
portions of the concordance. Max could possibly fund onsite
design day at Yale. CAA could possibly provide legal
assistance.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<p>American, Ancient and Classical, Meso-American and Islamic :
will be done by Susan, Alan and Michelline</p>

<p align="center">The DLF Academic Image Exchange Meeting<br />
<b>("The Barnraising")</b><br />
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, May 22-23, 1999<br />
Robert Baron and Lena Stebley<br />
</p>

1. Introduction and Background 

<p>In May 1999, a group of academic representatives met at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
under the aegis of the Digital Library Federation (DLF), to plan
the implementation of the Academic Image Exchange (AIE). AIE is
the working title of a DLF project to develop a digital network
of art historical images for academic and general use. The group
that met in May came together as a result of two earlier
meetings. The first in the New Haven, Connecticut, offices of the
DLF, when DLF Director Don Waters, Yale Arts Library Director Max
Marmor, Yale Visual Resources Curator Susan Williams, former
University of Pennsylvania Visual Resources Curator Micheline
Nilsen, and University of Pennsylvania Fine Arts Librarian,
William Keller originated the AIE proposal. The second meeting,
exploratory in focus, was held in New York on January 8,
1999.</p>

<p>Other individuals who have done work in this area or who have
useful expertise were then invited to join the planning effort,
and Robert Baron, arts information consultant and chair of the
College Art Association's Intellectual Property Committee, was
asked to become the AIE project manager. The May 1999 meeting
produced an action plan and timetable expected to result in an
AIE working prototype implemented on the World Wide Web by about
September 1999. The AIE effort is supported by DLF and by the
College Art Association (CAA). Apart from the CAA, no attempt has
been made to align the membership of this planning group with
that of any other organization, and the group anticipates
exploring the possibility of broadening participation, especially
among members of the Digital Library Federation.</p>

<p>The AIE project is intended as a response to the crisis that
has overcome the administration and use of academic visual
resources, which are described by Don Waters in his introductory
remarks at the May 1999 meeting. This crises arises on one hand,
from the parochial tradition of creating unshared catalogs, and
on the other hand, from the advancing claims of those who hold
economic interests in images of use to academia. Earlier projects
aimed at providing teachers with digital images never fully
succeeded in accomplishing their mission because they failed to
realize that the traditional development of visual resource
collections is driven by the demands of teachers and their
curricula and not by repositories and museums bent on marketing
their own collections.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of the art history survey and the popularity of
specialized courses in this discipline suggest that an investment
in a shared pool of digital art history survey images for both
nonprofit educational and unrestricted public use will result in
a substantial educational benefit and unquestionable
institutional savings. The mission of AIE is to reflect the needs
of the teaching community, which is why the group gathered in May
1999 was composed of visual resources curators, art and
architecture historians and photographers, librarians, and other
academics.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why the history of art serves as the
ideal environment for the development of a networked image access
system. Most importantly, among scholarly disciplines, the
history of art is probably the most highly dependent upon the
need to access and present a large corpus of high quality images.
Today, in the visual resources collections of libraries and art
history departments everywhere, collections of images are mostly
redundant and are often compromised by the high costs of
acquisition, of cataloging (also redundant), and of resource
management (including replacements due to loss, damage and
aging). Concern that the traditional acquisition technique for
new materials (photocopying from published books) may not pass
the legal hurdles of the fair use statute has caused some
colleges and universities to cease what they fear may be
questionable image acquisition activities.</p>

<p>Visual resources collections in libraries and art history
departments are now experimenting with creating digital
collections, but, in doing so, they are replicating and
inheriting many of the inefficiencies that were a necessary part
of maintaining repositories of analog images. Uncertainties
surrounding the ability to share both analog and digital
resources have erected <i>de facto</i> barriers to effective
communication between institutions and individuals, and, indeed,
have caused such institutions to erect electronic walls for the
sole purpose of keeping inquisitive eyes away from protected
materials. The sooner a universal and uniform resource of usable
images becomes available to all, the sooner art history and
related studies will be able to benefit from the simplified
access such a repository promises.</p>

<br />
 

<p>2. Project Description</p>

<p>In service to the teaching and practice of the history of art
and related fields, and as a means by which the benefits of
networked technologies may be introduced to teachers and
scholars, AIE intends to offer students, teachers, and the
public, curriculum-based sets of digital images for their free
and unrestricted use. The first set of images to be introduced
will satisfy a significant portion of the image requirements of
most college- and university-level introductory courses in art
history.</p>

<p>Beginning with works licensed for unencumbered use that have
been made available by what the AIE group expects to be an
increasing number of faculty photographers, and supplemented by
images culled from the public domain, AIE offerings will be
cataloged online and made available on the World Wide Web through
a database and an indexed concordance. The concordance is a tool
through which users may select works that correspond to images
used in the standard textbooks. From this beginning, the AIE
group envisions offering an ever-widening array of pedagogically
selected images. These are to be accessed, displayed, and
presented by a variety of software tools specifically fashioned
to serve AIE user communities, which will allow teachers to edit,
save, and create image sets for lectures, distance education, and
online study guides.</p>

<p>After mounting an initial set of key works and the
concordance, the development of additional image acquisition
sources will receive a high priority, with the AIE database as a
possible vehicle for publishing a want list [or wish list] of
sought-after images. Among potential donors will be museums
(including academic museums) wishing to offer teaching quality
images, scholar-photographers and architects with significant
private collections, libraries and archives holding stores of
public domain monographs and photograph collections, teachers,
and the occasional tourist. The AIE group is hopeful that the
success of the enterprise will encourage those who own copyright
of modern works to offer at least low-resolution versions of
their holdings. Publishers of textbooks, especially those indexed
in the concordance, will likely find that the AIE system
supplements their offerings and gives them new ways to package
their products. Ultimately, the AIE group hopes to encourage
publishers to offer for limited use by AIE, copyrighted materials
created for their editions, specifically maps, timelines,
reconstructions, and plans.</p>

<p>Because one of the goals of AIE is to encourage institutions
to provide the requisite infrastructure to allow digital images
to be used in the classroom, AIE is proposing to create a
critical mass of high quality images and cataloging data, enough
to mount a course and to author networked distance education
products. Under most circumstances, these images will be
available at no cost to scholars, to nonprofit educational
institutions, and to the general public. Because many of the
images have been provided by photographers who have licensed
their free use for nonprofit educational purposes, many of the
constraints faced by those who must clear permission to use
copyrighted works will no longer apply. In addition the AIE
expects to offer tools to permit teachers to edit, save, and
create image sets for lectures, distance education, and on-line
study guides.</p>

<p>Under a fully operational digital image system, faculty need
not pull slides each time they present a previously given
lecture, and images will always be available because they will no
longer need to hoard slides from other faculty. Curators will not
need to re-file, repair, and replace slides. In general, less
time will be devoted to maintenance and administration and more
time to course preparation and collection development.</p>

<p>The concordance structure envisaged for AIE will serve as a
crucial aid to digital teaching because it replicates the image
sequences and organizations used in standard texts. In the
classroom, any teacher with an open line to the Internet or who
has access to a local replica of the AIE site will be able to
show any AIE works on the spot without having planned to do so in
advance. The concordance will allow teachers to browse the image
set in art-historical order and/or in textbook order. As a
consequence, teaching will be able to be more responsive to the
needs of the moment and to suggestions coming from the class.</p>

<p>This openness will be supported by a universal cataloging
environment that will not change from institution to institution.
Teachers will be able to take their knowledge of the system with
them as their professional lives move from one school to another.
Indeed, they will be able to transport their entire curricula and
its illustrative program as they evolve and move.</p>

<p>Because the technology needed to use digital images in the
classroom is not yet broadly familiar to art historians, the AIE
group realizes that the AIE product must provide sufficient
educational materials to ease some of the expected initial
hesitation that inhibits busy people from experimenting with new
technologies. The educational program that will be part of AIE
will consist of gathering together resources such as articles
about using digital images for teaching, reviews of equipment and
software, and such technical literature and practical advice that
might ease a department's or faculty member's path into this
technology. These materials will be available through the front
page of AIE Web site. They will be publicized to potential
beneficiaries through the session on electronic teaching featured
at the annual meeting of the College Art Association an AIE
sponsor. This "magic classroom" session will begin to feature
applications of the Academic Image Exchange beginning in
2000.</p>

<p>Other educational byproducts that the AIE group proposes to
develop include pedagogical tools useful to faculty and students
working with digital images. Such tools may include (a) sorting
and set-up software (virtual slide-tables), (b) displayware that
will facilitate the traditional A-B Carousel comparison technique
for classroom projection, and (c) software tools that offer the
ability to store and re-edit image sequences used in class.</p>

<p>Part of AIE's goal is to show that online access and free
downloads offer benefits and savings that cannot be duplicated by
any analog collection of images. Some of these benefits will be
achieved through the educational program built into the AIE Web
site. Others can be shown to be attributable directly to the
system under which this digital image program exists. The
promised benefits would be the result of efficiencies of scale.
What might appear to be an unnecessarily expensive program when
undertaken by one department becomes valuable, efficient, and
pedagogically useful when many individuals and departments use
it. Of equal significance is the fact that the use of XML
(extensible markup language) in the development of the AIE's Web
presence will permit others to create specialized tools that work
with the AIE data and images.</p>

<p>The program proposed by the AIE group will justify faculty
investment in acquiring technology skills and give universities
confidence to invest in the technology infrastructure required
for successful teaching with digital images. Furthermore, AIE
activities will help create an expanding pool of skilled
personnel and will build an infrastructure that can be used at
low cost by disciplines whose needs for visual resources might
not, if they had to stand alone, justify such an investment.</p>

<p>As the Academic Image Exchange provides a transition to
twenty-first century networked access to images, it also expects
to develop communities of devoted academic users for whom the AIE
service will become the intended repository of their own image
and photographic collections. To this end, too, the AIE group
expects to develop procedures and tools that ease the donor's and
editor's work.</p>

Lists</i>, <i>Data Entry Object Records</i>, and <i>Portfolios
for the World Art Database</i>.</p>

<p>Structure</p>

<p>The two-day session was structured as a series of discussions
relating to presentations made by Robert and by Bob and his
invited guests, which included John Nestor, a well-known
authority on relational and object oriented database systems.
Robert presented a system composed of entity relationship
diagrams, a mock-up of a Web interface with query forms and
reports, and a variety of procedural diagrams. He termed it a
"straw man" system because its forms were designed to identify
the boundaries between what could be acknowledged as acceptable
and unacceptable procedures, and its purpose was to provoke
discussion by providing a platform upon which the committee could
articulate its varying points of view regarding the AIE mission
and design. This process would enable the group to come to the
policy decisions it needed to make in order to implement the AIE
project.</p>

<p>In their presentations, Professors Thibadeau and Nestor put
forward a proposal that the AIE system should be built on
extensible markup language (XML), a technology that they said
would at once ease development and help develop the community of
users the AIE group seeks. They and the other CMU faculty also
answered specific technical issues.</p>

<p>Goals</p>

<p>Project Manager Baron signaled that he expected the meeting to
achieve several tangible goals: to decide upon an economic model,
to define the community it serves, and to define those tasks that
will lead the group to develop a software platform upon which to
manifest this economic model. The overriding purpose of the CMU
meeting was to leave with (1) a plan for further action, (2) a
way to create a concordance, and (3) a plan to create a tangible,
if experimental, presence on the Web, with enough features
implemented and with a sufficient number of images to offer value
to its first users. During the course of the meeting, the group
came to realize that the educational component of the AIE product
was as important as the economic model and the software
platform.</p>

<p>Among the key technical issues to be resolved were</p>

<ol>
<li>to decide upon a data structure appropriate to the
description and classification of works of art and their
illustrations;</li>

<li>to decide how to implement and populate the database and
concordance and to define the relationship between them;</li>

<li>to define technical standards for usable images;</li>

<li>to determine which specialized tools will best serve the
academic community;</li>

<li>to choose a networked environment for AIE that will enable
its community of users to grow; and</li>

<li>to define levels of interoperability of infrastructure.</li>
</ol>

<p>The group should also consider the rights and privileges of
different types of users and their relationship to the image
service.</p>

<p>Robert asserted that the technical and structural issues
affecting implementation were to be understood as reflecting
differing agendas and missions held by working group members.
Earlier, in his introduction, Don Waters had invited the group to
use these differences as positive and creative forces that can be
used to improve the AIE product and make it more useful. The
group succeeded in meeting that challenge.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>4. Meeting Presentations</p>

<p>The Straw Man System Design</p>

<p>Robert walked the group through his straw man project design
and procedural flow charts. In this design, Robert defined users
as unregistered, nonprofit, and for-profit, with different
privileges pertaining to the nonprofit and for-profit groups.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Using XML and RDF</p>

<p>John Nestor discussed the benefits of using an open system
architecture and suggested that XML be used to present the
Academic Image Exchange project on the World Wide Web. XML, a
derivative of SGML, can be used as a format for presenting the
contents of a structured document on the Web and for creating an
environment suitable for the development of a variety of user
tools. For AIE purposes, one of the primary benefits of XML would
be that it enables any user to build custom applications with
which to store, search, and format any data following a common
tag set.</p>

<p>John discussed using RDF (Resource Description Framework) with
XML. He described RDF as XML with additional interpretation. He
provided URLs for the XML and RDF standards documented on the W3C
(World Wide Web Consortium) Web site, <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/XML"><font
size="2">http://www.w3c.org/XML</font></a> and <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/RDF"><font
size="2">http://www.w3c.org/RDF</font></a>. By publishing an XML
tag set for the AIE, he suggested, the AIE project may be able to
establish a de facto standard for similar databases, thereby
promoting the emergence of a community of related online
databases, while increasing the probability that the AIE site
will be found and used by searchers who may not be familiar with
the AIE service. The success of such an enterprise requires the
AIE system to be (1) open (so that users can build onto it) and
(2) extensible (to permit it to evolve and be adaptable). As
related products appear on the Web, AIE could also be (3)
distributed (to encourage participation and to use the Web to
create community).</p>

<p>For the AIE, XML can be used to offer the contents of almost
any database the AIE group chooses and will support the
variable-length/repeating field set specifications required.
Unfortunately, because XML can use distributed resources, it is
possible to lose linked information taken from elsewhere.
Professor Nestor did emphasize, therefore, the importance of
being confident in the stability of linked resources.</p>

<p>The group was generally interested in the XML and RDF
architecture, but in part was wary that the use of XML might not
sufficiently differentiate the AIE site from other less
authoritative offerings. Professors Nestor and Thibadeau assured
the group that the name-space paradigm of XML offers casual
visitors a way to differentiate the AIE works from others.</p>

<p>Server Space and Image Delivery System</p>

<p>Bob Thibadeau, on behalf of the School of Computer Science at
CMU, offered to provide free space on the school's server for AIE
use. The amount of space available can be measured in terabytes.
He estimated he could provide space for up to 50,000 relatively
high-resolution images. Bob Thibadeau stated that this system
would be free to AIE as long as the server was at CMU. He
estimated providing this service at a minimal cost of $300 or
$400 (in contrast to the $20,000 that CMU charges for-profit
organizations).</p>

<p>Guest speaker Bob Burger presented a server model optimized
for efficiently delivering large numbers of images on the Web.
His system stores only the original high-level scan. Based on
access rules and programmed policies, it would deliver derivative
images on the fly. By referring to system profile data that local
users provide, this server could perform unique custom color
correction for each user, an important asset for art historical
and connoisseurship studies. To set up the image server at CMU,
Bob Thibadeau requires the metadata specifications and XML
tags.</p>

<p>Intellectual Property Law</p>

<p>Intellectual property attorney Michael Shamos confirmed the
group's assumptions that the project needed written agreements
from contributors, and that it would be wise to carry liability
insurance against claims of infringement. Contributors would not
readily agree to accept liability, and asking them to do so would
be a strong disincentive to contribute images. Nonetheless,
contributors should be required to indicate that to their
knowledge the rights to their images are not defective. Mr.
Shamos offered a draft a model for a contributor's contract that
included the following key clauses:</p>

<ol>
<li>The contributor has no knowledge of copyright infringement or
claim thereof.</li>

<li>The contributor has no knowledge of contractual violation,
except (fill in the blank) ______.</li>

<li>The contributor agrees to the use the AIE may make of images
(e.g., "all uses made by this organization").</li>

<li>The AIE does not make contributors divest their
interests.</li>

<li>The contributor does not restrict the project's use of the
images.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>5. Project Design Decisions</p>

<p>The group agreed on a mission statement and discussed and took
decisions concerning a number of project design issues, including
the target audience, producing income, the concordance design,
image acquisition and Web submission, image format and
downloading, labor, and right to image use.</p>

<p>Mission Statement</p>

<p>After a day of intense discussion, the group drafted a
preliminary mission statement based upon Don Waters' opening
remarks:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><i>The Academic Image Exchange will build a comprehensive
resource of digital images that support curriculum-based teaching
and learning in art history and related fields of study that
depend on the use of visual resources.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To achieve this mission the following objectives should be
met:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ol>
<li><i>Build a quality database of digital images.</i></li>

<li><i>Enable free access for nonprofit educational
purposes.</i></li>

<li><i>Create and enable others to create a rich set of
applications.</i></li>

<li><i>Build community through the use of shared
resources.</i></li>

<li><i>Create want lists for the database and solicit from
individuals and institutions images for the exchange.</i></li>

<li><i>Offer a model for shared cataloging.</i></li>

<li><i>Develop applications for users and user
communities.</i></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The group agreed that it should proceed to develop a
concordance-based Web-mounted database of images composed of the
current holdings of group members. Search and retrieval tools
should be simple enough for students to use without confusion.
The group agreed that revenue can be generated by creating access
tools, editing tools, and other applications customized for its
various user groups. Membership plans should be developed that do
not compromise the mission to offer license-free images.</p>

<p>There was considerable interest (with some qualifications) in
endorsing the use of the XML approach to open architecture as a
means of creating and attracting a community of users and as a
beginning to creating standards for shared cataloging. The entity
relationship model is to be based on the plan offered by Robert
Baron. The data dictionary for art work (object) description will
be based on the core fields developed by the Visual Resources
Association (VRA) as implemented by Susan Jane Williams at
Yale.</p>

<p>Registration and Audience</p>

<p>After initial reluctance to ask nonprofit users to register,
participants agreed that registration was important to track and
record the activities of different types of users and realized
that registration was a prerequisite to offering advanced
services. Tracking information and statistical data was in any
case needed to apply for funding and for other fundraising
efforts.</p>

<p>While the group agreed that the target audience was higher
education, they also realized that many other audiences could be
well served by the AIE image-base. To address the needs of these
users, such as K-12 education, AIE would offer additional
specialized tools that help interpret and present AIE images to a
variety of audiences. Such tools may range from forms containing
pre-selected sets of images suitable for specific audiences, to
simplified query engines that are easy to use. For academic use,
AIE may offer online tools for arranging images to form lectures,
or ways to keep and name pointers to images that are being kept
for specific purposes, such as research. Faculty members may wish
to attach their personal curricula to those already within the
concordance.</p>

<p>Income-Generating Activities</p>

<p>One of the greatest challenges to a project such as this is
how to continue to offer free images, while raising enough funds
to keep the program self-sufficient. Many suggestions were
offered for producing income while still offering free downloads.
These included</p>

<ul>
<li>charging for projection quality images,</li>

<li>licensing the use of the various tool sets,</li>

<li>charging fees for creating CD-ROMs of images,</li>

<li>offering institutional and departmental memberships, and</li>

<li>asking individuals to pay for the use of tool sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, vendors of teaching and research images may wish to
integrate their catalogs with the AIE databases, and agreements
with such vendors can include a fee or percentage of sales that
would generate income for the project. For-profit users can be
required to pay fees to join and to publish images from the AIE
stock. Publishers and service providers may find the AIE pages
congenial to advertising aimed at the academic community. Linking
to Amazon.com would provide a commission on sales. Extra service
components, such as bibliographies and access to certain user
contributions can also be fee-based. As a program of a
not-for-profit organization, AIE can expect to attract
tax-deductible monetary donations and donations in kind.</p>

<p>Concordance Design</p>

<p>The group agreed that a database with a concordance interface
was the minimal acceptable implementation needed to demonstrate
the feasibility of the AIE project. It was decided that the
concordance prototype should aim to cover the entire scope of the
standard two-term art history survey curriculum (prehistoric to
modern art), with the understanding that it may be difficult or
impossible to obtain rights to use images of works still under
copyright. The full concordance will cite approximately 2,500
works, including those for which AIE group members have no
images. The group thought that the first impression of the Image
Exchange should be enduring. To ensure that the first
implementation of the prototype was memorable and representative
of the overall curriculum, it was decided that it should contain
about half of the images used in the surveys. These images would
come from all areas of the survey (with the exception of modern
art) and would be accompanied at least by minimal cataloging
data. The stated goal was to release the prototype in a testbed
implementation on or about September 1999.</p>

<p>Allan Kohl offered the use of his concordance list for
building the concordance prototype. He estimated it would take
one month to complete the list, which is limited to what he
defines as consensus key monuments (those works used by more than
one of the major survey textbooks). The group agreed that the
consensus core-2,500 objects from the concordance-should be
cataloged in advance before it is linked to images and to the
concordance data. This procedure might involve negotiating with
expert subject catalogers. Some members of the group believed
that the concordance should index the exact contents of each
selected textbook and should not attempt to merge data or
eliminate data not identified as consensus monuments, but that
view did not prevail.</p>

<p>Objections were raised to the practice of image substitution
(using one object to stand for its functional equivalent when an
image of the exact monument used in the books is not available).
The group agreed, however, that this practice was pedagogically
defensible and consistent with the aims of the concordance
database. The AIE may also find that it has at its disposal more
than one view of any target object and may have to decide whether
to limit itself to a single image or to use several. Issues of
this nature will be decided by a review committee of art
historians, since there is no way to predetermine
programmatically whether the aims of the concordance will best be
served by including several views or a single one.</p>

<p>It is the group's intention ultimately to offer as many views
of well-known objects as possible, in keeping with the AIE
mission, because multiple views facilitate diverse ways of
interpreting objects. For the purpose of the concordance, care
must be taken that the images selected at least support the ideas
of the textbook authors. The concordance committee was charged
with selecting the appropriate view or views for the concordance
and with engaging a review panel of prominent art historians to
help determine whether the images selected have valid art
historical utility.</p>

<p>Image Acquisition and Web Submission</p>

<p>In an effort to release image donors from having to adhere to
the same standards expected of AIE catalogers, the group approved
the outline of a simple Web submission form that should be
suitable for submitting several images at a time (perhaps up to
25). For large, collection-sized donations of images, AIE would
negotiate arrangements directly with donors to make the process
as simple and as professional as possible. To acquire digital
versions of large collections, special funding may have to be
solicited. Owners of scanned collections should be given copies
of the scans and data and should have unencumbered access to
their collections at the AIE site. The group agreed that an
efficient and accurate system with which to track transactions
and match catalog data to images would be essential. Bob
Thibadeau has access to a scanner that scans slides and slide
labels surfaces together, thereby linking textual descriptions to
scanned transparencies.</p>

<p>The group agreed that the minimum data needed to describe a
submitted object would include</p>

<ol>
<li>Title</li>

<li>Image Description (this field needs to be clearly defined
with a sample entry)</li>

<li>Source (repository)</li>

<li>Contact and copyright holder information</li>

<li>Image file link or identification information</li>
</ol>

<p>It was agreed that it would not be necessary to include a
working submission form in the prototype; a dummy model would
suffice. A formal contract or agreement and copyright warranty
should be part of the submission form. CMU agreed to model the
prototype database to an XML-based entry form.</p>

<p>The straw man system Robert presented would provide scholars
the opportunity to submit more complexly elaborated data that
would enhance the quality and utility of the database. This
feature was not discussed, but access to such records was cited
as a potential benefit of membership.</p>

<p>No decision was made to license use of specialized thesauri
such as ULAN and the AAT. No effort is being made at this time to
provide structured subject access.</p>

<p>Image Format, Submission, and Downloading</p>

<p>The procedures available to users who want to take or receive
images will probably be tied to options crucial to the success of
the business plan. It has been agreed that casual users may take
any image they need directly from the screen. Only two
resolutions-thumbnail and screen-size (480 x 640)-will be
available in this manner. All other resolutions, including
projectable images and perhaps publishable images, will be
available through direct download or written to CD-ROM.
Income-producing activities may include making the right of
access to the higher resolution images a privilege of membership.
Downloaded images may be linked to data files, whose format will
be selected by the user.</p>

<p>Participants also discussed standards for accepting and
delivering digital images. No consensus in this area emerged. The
group agreed to assume that the primary use of images would be
for classroom projection, which requires large files. Because
high-resolution digital projection is an emerging technology, the
practical high-resolution limit has not yet been determined.
Ideally images should be stored in the highest resolution
feasible, but for reasons of efficiency and for purposes of
establishing the corpus of images that constitute the
concordance, it was decided to accept the highest resolution
currently available, while establishing standards for new
scans.</p>

<p>Susan encouraged the group to limit submissions to three
formats: (1) slides or negatives (to be digitized by the AIE
staff), (2) PhotoCD (from which only the 18-MB files would be
taken), and (3) raw TIFF scans (unprocessed, 18 MB). These three
formats would generate the highest level masters for
multipurposing as needed and should be useful for at least
several years into the future. The group agreed it would be
preferable to obtain large files. However, to generate the
necessary critical mass of images, the group acknowledged that it
may be necessary to relax this requirement temporarily by
accepting lower resolution scans as place-holders until better
ones can be obtained.</p>

<p>Although the selection of standards and techniques to control
image quality could not be decided at this meeting, it was
acknowledged to be crucial to the project's eventual acceptance
and success. Instead of instituting technical standards, it was
decided to judge each image and its derivatives on the dual bases
of appropriateness and quality.</p>

<p>Labor</p>

<p>It was the consensus of the group that the AIE could not rely
on a pool of volunteer slide curators to be responsible for
cataloging. The Vision Project, sponsored by Visual Resources
Association (VRA) and the Research Libraries Group showed that in
the absence of cataloging rules, using a dispersed group of
catalogers resulted in confusing and inconsistent results. Don
stated that funding for processing staff must be built into the
project's business plan. The group agreed that a part-time
processor should be hired to process images and collect
cataloging information. Max volunteered workspace at Yale for the
part-time cataloger/processor and offered to identify funding for
image scanning.</p>

<p>Intellectual Property Rights</p>

<p>The mechanism by which the AIE is able to publish its images
on the Web depends upon use of the public domain and upon the
good will of faculty photographers who license to the AIE their
photographs of public domain objects. Recent case law (Bridgeman
v. Corel) suggests that certain reproductive images of works in
the public domain may not be copyrightable and thus may be copied
and republished with impunity. This was also the opinion of the
intellectual property attorney at the meeting, Michael Shamos.
However the judicial history on this point is not yet clear, so
that use of reproductive images that carry a claim of copyright
(defensible or not) may not yet be in the best interest of the
AIE. After a discussion about the lack of copyright protection
for any non-unique (reproductive) photographs of public domain
objects (in light of the Bridgeman case), Robert, Don, Max, and
Katie agreed to develop a plan of action to ensure that the AIE
has a viable policy regarding the submission of such reproductive
photographs.</p>

<p>The group felt that for the purpose of the establishing the
prototype, the AIE would not be able to settle all issues
surrounding the ownership and use of intellectual property. Katie
urged using a contributor contract. Chris offered the contract
used by the Academic Press <i>Image Directory</i>. It is clear
that the AIE needs the services of an intellectual property
attorney.</p>

<p>Individual Agendas and Unresolved Issues</p>

<p>During discussions a variety of personal agendas emerged.
Individual group members expressed the desire</p>

<ul>
<li>to make certain that the images that constitute the AIE
offerings are always of sufficient quality to make them useful
and attractive for teaching;</li>

<li>to provide the opportunity for contributors to earn income
from sales of the highest resolution scans of their images;</li>

<li>to use the concordance as a live tool with which to record
the evolution of the canon of key monuments and to allow the
concordance to serve as a rudimentary index to pedagogical
literature on works of art;</li>

<li>to use AIE as a means of creating communities of users
dedicated to building a universal image resource in the fine arts
and to organize and rescue images from the limbo of the public
domain;</li>

<li>to offer a way for local collections to share their
cataloging efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The group did not resolve a number of questions about
concordance images, including</p>

<ol>
<li>What specific views will users want?</li>

<li>How will the images be used?</li>

<li>Does AIE accept poor quality images when none others are
available?</li>

<li>Does AIE include links to image vendors? Does AIE encourage
vendors to list their offerings in the AIE database?</li>

<li>What will be the policy on changing data submitted by
donors?</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>6. Next Steps</p>

<p>The group adopted an action plan, a timetable, and an
organizational structure for carrying the project forward during
1999. An interim governing board and six committees were formed
and given assignments, leading up to a testbed prototype
implementation on the Web by about September 1999.</p>

<p>Action Plan Summary</p>

<p>Eight main tasks were included in the action plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Devise a viable strategy regarding the protection and
dissemination of intellectual property.</li>

<li>Build concordance.</li>

<li>Gather images (within the AIE group and solicited on an
individual basis).</li>

<li>Transmit images to Susan for processing (cataloging,
preparation for review).</li>

<li>Hire a part-time employee to catalog and process images.</li>

<li>Map Susan's FileMaker Pro files to the data model.</li>

<li>Move information to the prototype developers who map data
model and entity descriptions to an XML interface.</li>

<li>Create forms (Web submission, network cataloging), tools, and
other applications.</li>
</ol>

<p>A flowchart of the process and resources was outlined on the

<br />
 

<p>(a) For missing images, Robert and Katie will work to identify
sources of images and donors. (b) The <b>Review Committee</b>
(appointed by Charles and Katie) will decide whether the images
are acceptable for the purpose of teaching survey courses.</p>

<p>Timetable</p>

<p>End of June 1999: Complete concordance lists and data model
(concordance and database fields only).</p>

<p>Beginning of August 1999: Concordance filled at least 50
percent</p>

<p>September 1999: Working prototype</p>

<p>Organization and Governance</p>

<p>Don asked the participants (see earlier list of participants)
at the meeting to serve as an interim <b>Governing Board</b>. He
charged the group with the task of eventually replacing itself by
creating a permanent institution for governance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A <b>Concordance Committee</b> consisting of Allan, Kathy,
Jeff, Paula, Micheline, and Robert will be responsible for</p>

<ol>
<li>creating a concordance database,</li>

<li>selecting a list of books to use in the concordance,</li>

<li>deciding whether to list all images from the designated set
of textbooks or only those that appear more than once (Allan's
consensus key monuments),</li>

<li>deciding if AIE should provide multiple views of the same
object when available,</li>

<li>deciding whether to identify a generic (substitution) view or
the closest exact view (if three textbooks show three different
roman villas, does one look for all three, or substitute a single
generic villa to stand for them all?),</li>

<li>gathering images on Kodak PhotoCD,</li>

<li>publishing a concordance want list, and</li>

<li>monitoring progress in acquiring missing key monuments.</li>
</ol>

<p>A <b>Data Model Committee</b> consisting of Susan, Chris,
Micheline, and Robert will be responsible for the following
design and implementation tasks:</p>

<p>Design:</p>

<ol>
<li>reconciling data fields with VRA Core (making sure needs of
architectural cataloging are covered),</li>

<li>filling out entity relationship diagram with fields,</li>

<li>creating data dictionary with fields and attributes, and</li>

<li>manifesting the relationship model.</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li>implementing the model on a system,</li>

<li>cataloging concordance records or gaining access to existing
catalog records,</li>

<li>creating a Web entry form for cataloging,</li>

<li>linking cataloging records to concordance entries, and</li>

<li>implementing the system on the Web for networked access.</li>
</ol>

<p>An <b>Evaluation Committee</b> consisting of Charles Rhyne and
Katie Hollander will</p>

<ol>
<li>review images and metadata,</li>

<li>solicit images within the scope of want list,</li>

<li>establish technical standards,</li>

<li>establish photographic quality standards and</li>

<li>identify a Review Committee.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <b>Review Committee</b> will consist of select art
historians not associated with the AIE project and its job will
be to decide whether the selected images are acceptable for the
purpose of teaching the survey course ("the stamp of
approval").</p>

<p>An <b>Advisory Committee</b> consisting of Max, Jeff, and
Katie ex officio is charged with making decisions about
advertisers and corporate sponsors on behalf of the AIE
group.</p>

<p>An <b>Intellectual Property Committee</b> consisting of
Robert, Don, Max, and Katie will develop a plan of action to
ensure that the AIE has a viable policy regarding the submission
of reproductive photographs and has appropriate contractual
arrangements for contributors of photographs. Along with legal
agreements for donors of photographs, guidelines are needed to
determine the public domain status of other images and
photographs. For these tasks, the advice of counsel will be
required.</p>

<p>Three other areas were identified: technical systems, legal
issues and marketing but committee members were not assigned at
the meeting.</p>

<p>Image Inventory Tasks</p>

<p>A subgroup of the <b>Concordance Committee-</b>Allan, Kathy,
Paula, and Jeff- was assigned the task of gathering images for
the concordance. <b>Robert Baron</b> was asked to keep track of
the progress of assembling concordance images. A quick inventory
of the images available within the group was taken: Allan Kohl
had 25 percent of the images for Ancient to Medieval periods (all
available without royalty). He had 50 percent of images for the
Medieval period (mainly from reproductions, though there might be
copyright issues with these). He had 10 percent from the
Renaissance to Modern periods. Jeff Cohen and Paula Behrens
(through SAH) have images in 640 x 480dpi resolution of
architecture up to the Renaissance. They were willing to create
larger files using the original source materials. If additional
images were needed for AIE, they offered to solicit images from
other SAH contributors. The SAH Image Exchange concordance
includes three textbooks.</p>

<p>Kathleen Cohen agreed to provide her digital images for the
first half of the survey. She was willing to offer images at the
640 x 480dpi level. In addition to developing her own project,
Kathy has worked with a consortium of visual resources curators
from the California State University, in their efforts to
assemble an image database. Some of these California materials
may be made available to the AIE. The California group has
completed the first half of the art history survey and is
maintaining a concordance grid to keep track of their
progress.</p>

<p><b>Kathy and Allan</b> agreed to inventory holdings and to
consolidate their list of images in order to cover gaps in the
first half of the survey. Jeff, Micheline, and Paula will finish
their architecture concordance, currently completed up to the
Renaissance. To expand the AIE concordance holdings, potential
image donors will be contacted individually after the AIE group
has analyzed images supplied by members of the group. The group
agreed it could easily identify the locations of special
collections without a public solicitation. <b>Katie and
Robert</b> will work to identify potential image donors. Katie
offered to approach several authors of survey texts and to
request use of images for which they own copyright. In addition
Katie thought that some members of the CAA board might be willing
to provide some images. She agreed to solicit images from the
board, either when they meet in July or via the CAA board
listserv.</p>

<p>Data Fields and Cataloging Tasks</p>

<p>The decision was made to provide a catalog record for each
image in the concordance in advance. These records would serve as
placeholders and permit an easy inventory of remaining gaps.
<b>Susan</b> was given the cataloging task and will be
responsible for creating a first draft of the cataloging data
fields based on her Filemaker Pro slide cataloging system. Upon
review by the <b>Data Model Committee</b>, other fields may be
added to Susan's sample form. Other areas-rights and permissions,
membership categories and rules, order transactions, and
information submission forms, and others- also need to be
developed. Susan's field list must be parsed to replicate the
entity relationship diagram.</p>

<p>Concordance Production Tasks</p>

<p></p>

<p>The concordance system will be created by linking the
concordance database, the object description database, the
images, and several other files. <b>Susan</b> will populate the
object list and provide requisite image scans. <b>Kathy and
Allan</b> will provide images and create the concordance file.
<b>Robert</b> will create file and field specifications in
accordance with the entity relationship diagram and will describe
the few requisite application tools needed. The <b>Data
Committee,</b> with the help of other members, should approve the
field list. The <b>Review Committee</b> will authorize the use of
submitted images. Carnegie-Mellon programming support will use
these elements to build a relational database, provide the XML
code, and mount the application on Web servers under a domain
name still to be determined.</p>

<p>In summary, the key subtasks in producing the concordance are
to</p>

<ol>
<li>examine Susan's cataloging system, parsing it to fit the
entity-relationship model, and adding or redefining fields as
required;</li>

<li>make a file and field lists with attributes (the data
dictionary) and fit it into the schema;</li>

<li>upload the database specifications and the database to the
Carnegie Mellon server with records and images; and</li>

<li>review the systems and images.</li>
</ol>

<p>Image Quality and Selection Tasks</p>

<p>Although the selection of standards and techniques to control
image quality could not be decided at this meeting, it was
acknowledged to be crucial to the project's eventual acceptance
and success. Instead of instituting technical standards, it was
decided to judge each image and its derivatives on the dual bases
of appropriateness and quality. To administer this vetting
process, the group appointed an <b>Evaluation Committee</b> that
will be responsible for selecting an unaffiliated group of art
historians (the <b>Review Committee</b>) to judge image quality.
For the purposes of the prototype, the evaluation process will
not be fully developed. The effectiveness of this technique will
be evaluated. To save processing time, only full scans will be
viewed. The committee should expect to meet to compare groups of
images and to select those deemed appropriate for use in the
concordance. The SAH group estimates it takes about four hours to
review about 250 slides. Slide donors should be asked to stamp
their name on each item submitted and care must be taken to show
that the AIE project takes responsible care of materials
submitted. Tentatively, July was selected as the time frame for
the concordance image review.</p>

<p>Funding Tasks</p>

<p><u>Planning Grant.</u> With regard to the strategic, legal,
and practical issues, it was decided that <b>Katie, Max, and
Don</b> would search for funds to aid in the initial stages of
development. Specifically, monies will be required in order
to</p>

<ol>
<li>obtain legal advice on what public domain means in light of
the Bridgeman decision,</li>

<li>obtain legal advice on contractual relationships with AIE
contributors and donors,</li>

<li>hire expert catalogers for the descriptions of the works of
art, and</li>

<li>subcontract programmers at CMU.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the June 15 meeting at the CAA offices, the planning grant
requirements were established in greater detail. The work
flowchart of activities to be supported by the planning grant is
available at <a href="../../aieflowchart.gif"><font
size="2">http://www.diglib.org/aieflowchart.gif</font></a> .</p>

<p> </p>

<p><u>Towards a Business Plan.</u> <b>Katie</b> will develop
plans for advertising and corporate sponsorship for consideration
by the <b>Advisory Committee</b> (Max and Jeff) and will prepare
a list of sponsors and advertisers for the committee's review.
The <b>Advisory Committee</b> was charged with making decisions
about advertisers and corporate sponsors on behalf of the AIE.
Katie will pursue all sources of funding (foundations, corporate)
at the same time, including the ideas for generating revenue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Institutional subscriptions through CAA that would provide
access to AIE premium services or value-added features.</li>

<li>Publishers interested in advertising on the AIE Web site, or
using the AIE mailing list.</li>

<li>Linking to an online bookseller such as Amazon.com to earn a
commission on each book sold.</li>

<li>Providing a full set of digital images to publishers to
promote new textbooks.</li>

<li>Packaging images in sets as a value-added product for users
who would rather buy sets than spend time downloading them.</li>

<li>Offering CD-ROM service instead of downloads.</li>
</ul>
