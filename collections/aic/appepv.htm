<h2>Final Report on the Academic Image Exchange Appendix E.</h2>

<h3>Technical standards and guidelines for image
contributors</h3>
</center>

<p>Developed at a meeting of the AIC held at Yale University on 4
August 2000.</p>

<h3>E1. Standards the AIC will apply in creating and managing
master digital image files and associated metadata</h3>

<h4>Image formats</h4>

<p><i>Principle: master files will supply the same resolution of
a 35mm slide or better</i></p>

<p><b><i>File format</i></b>: Uncompressed TIFF</p>

<p><b><i>Color depth, etc.:</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>Color images: 24bit color, 8 bits per channel, no alpha or
other types of channels. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Greyscale (where appropriate) - 8-bit greyscale

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Bitonal (only likely to be included in the collection in
exceptional circumstances)</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Resolution</i></b>: 3072 x 2048 pixels at 72 dpi
(resolution may be higher where images are based on formats
larger than 35mm slides)</p>

<p><i>File size</i>: Likely to be between 14-25MB depending on
format of source image</p>

<p><b><i>Post-processing</i></b>: AIC will post-process (crop,
color correct, filter, sharpen) raw TIFFs according to guidelines
to be developed</p>

<h4>The AIC metadata record</h4>

<p><i>Principle: to develop of a VRA 3.0 conformant
implementation that is consistent with the requirements of the
AIC's online service, the AIC's business interests, and the AIC's
data and rights management requirements</i></p>

<p>The AIC metadata record will be developed for the AIC by early
2001 on the basis of existing VRA version 3.0.</p>

<h4>File-naming conventions</h4>

<p><i>Principle: To adopt conventions that supports the AIC's
data management and dissemination needs with minimum
redundancy</i></p>

<p>Two strategies will be reviewed, revised and one selected for
implementation by end September 2000.</p>

<p>Strategy one (based on U Michigan's file-naming convention).
Image files maintain the names supplied by their creators and are
entered into directories which are themselves named by some
combination of (a) a standardized abbreviated contributor name
(b) a time/date stamp (c) a CD number - i.e. as will be necessary
where contributors supply several CDs on a given date. Post
processed image files will retain their original names and be
stored in sub-directories of those just described.</p>

<p>Strategy two. Image files are supplied with some normalized
AIC-generated name that may be mapped onto the file-naming
convention described above</p>

<h3>E2. Standards the AIC will require of image contributors</h3>

<p><i>Principle: By supplying guidelines to its contributors, the
AIC will help to ensure the quality and consistency of its
collections and services. Where contributors supply images in
digital form, the guidelines will also assist the AIC in
preserving those digital images on their contributors'
behalf</i></p>

<h4>Formats AIC will require/prefer from contributors</h4>

<p><b><i>Non-digital image formats</i></b>: Where non-digital
formats are concerned, the AIC will consider digitizing (or
assisting in the digitization of) images that are supplied in
formats to be agreed between the AIC and its contributors. AIC
may prefer 35 mm slides but will accept both larger formats and
materials that are film positive,s film negatives, and prints,
pending discussion and review of sample materials.</p>

<p><b><i>Digital formats</i></b> may be supplied as TIFFs or as
Kodak PhotoCD. They will typically be supplied on CD-ROMs (to be
returned by AIC to the contributor) created in conformance with
ISO 9660. The image should conform to the standards specified
above with the following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>File formats: TIFFs may be LZW compressed</li>

<li>Resolution: AIC may accept resolutions that have a minimum
true optical resolution of 1024x768 pixels.</li>

<li>Post processing: AIC prefers raw scans. Post-processed images
may be accepted after review by AIC staff.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Image documentation supplied by contributors</h4>

<p><i>Principal: Image must be supplied with a minimum level of
administrative and descriptive metadata. Descriptive metadata
will be sufficient to enable an appropriately skilled individual
to create a full AIC metadata record for the underlying
image.</i></p>

<p>Minimum level metadata will consist of</p>

<ul>
<li>global attributes (e.g. attributes that may be supplied once
and associated with all images in a contributed n image set) 

<ul>
<li>contributor name</li>

<li>contributor contact information (email, phone, fax, postal
address)</li>

<li>date contributed to AIC</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Item-level attributes (attributes that must be supplied for
each image) 

<ul>
<li>filename/slidenumber/image identifier</li>

<li>title or description of work</li>

<li>creator or cultural context and date of work</li>

<li>photographer</li>

<li>date photographed if available</li>

<li>museum/location of work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Rights information may be a global attribute (e.g. where the
same rights information applies to all images contributed in an
image set) or an item-level attribute (e.g. where rights
information differs across images included within an image set).
Where rights information is a global attribute, it may be
supplied by AIC staff at accession</p>

<p>Contributors are encouraged to supply any additional metadata
that exist such as</p>

<ul>
<li>additional descriptive metadata (e.g. item notes, description
of work, etc)</li>

<li>additional technical information (e.g. hardware profile, film
type, scanner hardware, scanning notes, etc. that may exist for
contributed digital images)</li>
</ul>

<p>Metadata must be logically associated with images (whether
supplied in digital or non-digital form) e.g. through application
of some internally consistent file-naming convention</p>

<p>Metadata must be supplied in machine readable form as
delimited ASCII files which are sufficiently documented so that
they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify tables and fields</li>

<li>Map tables/fields to the minimum metadata requirement as
specified above</li>

<li>Supply abbreviation keys or codebooks where appropriate</li>

<li>Supply information about use of controlled vocabularies</li>
</ul>

<p>AIC will undertake to assist potential contributors by
developing web-accessible guidelines for contributors including
examples of acceptable and unacceptable practices, pointers to
related information resources, etc <!-- End text -->
