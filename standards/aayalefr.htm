<H2>Developing a standard for recording contextual
information for archival and manuscript materials</h2>

<P><B>Report of a meeting at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut</B>
<P><B>December 4-6, 1998</B></CENTER>
<P><BR><BR>
<P>On December 4-6, 1998, a group of archivists, archival educators, and
information scientists met at Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University. The
purpose of this meeting was to discuss the establishment of an international
collaborative project to advance the definition and implementation of a
methodology for recording information about the contexts in which archival
records, personal papers, and similar materials have been created and used. The
participants included individuals from Australia, Canada, the European Union
Archival Network, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as from the United
States. Support for the meeting was provided by the Digital Library Federation
and by the Manuscripts and Archives department of the Yale University Library.
<P>Discussion of an archival description methodology based on separate but
linked descriptions of archival materials and of the contexts in which they have
been created and used dates back to 1985 and the work of Richard Lytle and David
Bearman in defining the concept. Since that initial discussion, a number of
archivists have built the concept into their practice and systems, but a
standard for recording contextual information has not yet emerged in the
profession. During the comment period leading up to the adoption of the General
International Standard for Archival Description - ISAD(G) - comments by various
reviewers noted the absence of ISAD(G) support for this approach. As a result, ,
the descriptive standards drafting committee subsequently developed the
International Standard Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons,
and Families - ISAAR (CPF). This development recognized the growing acceptance
of this methodology by the international archival community.
<P>ISAAR (CPF) provides a framework for the types of information that archivists
need to record about organizations, individuals, and families, but does not
provide an implementation standard nor an encoding scheme. The further
development of contextual information as an integral component of archival
description and retrieval requires a data structure standard and format specific
to this type of information that will enable archivists to record it
consistently within and across repositories. The success of the MARC-AMC format
in the U.S. and the Encoded Archival Description document type definition
internationally (both of which are primarily formats for description of archival
materials) needs to be matched by a similar effort for contextual information.
<P>Following discussions at a meeting of the Society of American Archivists' EAD
Working Group, Wendy Duff of the University of Toronto, Daniel Pitti of the
University of Virginia, and Richard Szary of Yale University, organized the Yale
meeting to determine the prospects for an international collaborative effort to
develop this standard. They identified a number of archivists who had
implemented contextual information in systems they had developed or who have
been active in the discussions of the concept and invited them to a meeting in
New Haven. Also invited were information scientists who had been active in
studying and developing online retrieval systems for bibliographic materials and
vocabulary control. The planned outcome of the meeting was to determine whether
there was sufficient interest in the project to pursue support for the effort.
<P>Two preliminary discussion papers defined the concept (then being called
archival authority information), identified existing implementations, and
proposed the elements of a successful standard and prototype implementation.
Participants spent much of the first day reviewing and confirming their shared
understanding of the concept and examining existing implementations. While none
of the implementations contained the same set of information, structures, or
capabilities, there was sufficient similarity in the approaches taken to
reinforce the opinion that a common methodology underlay the implementations.
<P>Over the next day and a half, the participants discussed the steps that
needed to be taken to provide interested archivists and repositories with a
platform from which these approaches could be tested systematically and
discussed by the community. The scheduled review of the ISAAR (CPF) standard in
2001 suggested itself to the group as a useful event for directing the pace of
the work. In particular, the group felt that a formal submission of its findings
on the benefits and consequences of managing contextual information to the ICA
body reviewing ISAAR (CPF) would provide an excellent way of ensuring that any
suggested developments were subject to full review and approval by a
professionally-recognized and international standard-setting authority.
<P>The meeting participants decided that further work was warranted and
necessary to identify and promulgate a professional consensus on the structure,
elements, and functionality of contextual information within an archival
information system. They identified the following projects and actions that
needed to be undertaken to advance understanding and consensus and to coordinate
work throughout the international archival community:
<OL>
  <LI>Establish an ad hoc international coordinating body to track the work
  being done on contextual information by various individuals and organizations
  and to serve as a clearinghouse for communications with other interested
  members of the profession. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Develop a preliminary SGML/XML-compliant document type definition for
  contextual information, based on elements identified in ISAAR (CPF). This dtd
  should also be compatible with the structure and purposes of the Encoded
  Archival Description dtd. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Implement the preliminary dtd on an operational system that can serve as a
  testbed for experimentation and analysis. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Identify and map existing sources of contextual information against the
  preliminary dtd to test the comprehensiveness and structure of the ISAAR
  elements. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Investigate and define the types of products that the dtd should support
  and test the dtd to ensure that such products can be generated from instances.
  Examples given included organizational charts and genealogies. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Identify and define other types of specialized contextual data systems
  (such as geographic information systems and government locator systems) to
  determine whether and how they should be linked to a contextual information
  dtd. In particular, the group was interested in how genealogical information
  recorded in the GEDCOM data structure might be represented in an SGML/XML
  document type definition and made interoperable with the contextual
  information dtd. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Conduct user studies to determine whether and how contextual information
  supports the research process of various categories of users. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Investigate the elements, structure, and capabilities needed to record
  descriptions of organizational functions and personal activities. Investigate
  whether functional descriptions should be accommodated within a contextual
  information dtd that also includes descriptions of organizations, persons, and
  families, or whether a separate definition is needed. <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Develop a standard list of relationship types which would link entities
  described in a contextual information dtd. Such relationships would include
  those between similar entities (e.g., relationships between organizations) and
  those between dissimilar entities (e.g., relationships between persons and
  organizations). <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Investigate the concept of organizational change to develop guidelines for
  determining the conditions under which a change in the characteristics of an
  entity are sufficient to require a new instance for the changed entity. As an
  example, should a name change for a government agency that does not involve
  any substantive changes in its functional responsibilities require a new
  contextual information instance for that entity? Conversely, would a
  significant change in function without a name change trigger such an action?
  <BR>&nbsp;
  <LI>Following development and testing of the dtd, develop a Z39.50 attribute
  set for both the contextual information and the Encoded Archival Description
  document type definitions. </LI></OL>
<P><BR>Based on this work agenda, the group invited Yale University to serve as
the home for the international coordinating body and establish the necessary
clearinghouse mechanisms for the project. Participants agreed to begin work on a
number of the various projects outlined above with progress reports to be
distributed through the mechanisms set up through Yale. The group also agreed to
identify other archivists, repositories, or archival organizations who were
either willing to collaborate on these projects or review their results, with
the aim of encouraging an international, profession-wide dialogue on the issues.
