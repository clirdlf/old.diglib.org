<h2>I. Introduction and History</h2>
</center>
    <p>The Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (referred to as
     the <i>TEI Guidelines</i>) were first published in 1994 and represent a tremendous
     achievement in electronic text standards by providing a highly sophisticated structure for encoding
     electronic text. Digital librarians have benefited greatly from the standardization provided by these
     guidelines, and the potential for interoperability and long-term preservation of digital collections
     facilitated by their wide adoption.</p>

    <p>In 1998, the Digital Library Federation (DLF) sponsored the <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/workshops/teidlf/index.html">TEI and XML in Digital Libraries Workshop</a> at the
     Library of Congress to discuss the use of the <i>TEI Guidelines</i> in libraries for electronic text,
     and to create a set of best practices for librarians implementing them. From this workshop, three working
     groups were formed the members of which represented some of the largest and most mature digital library
     programs in the U.S. Group 2 was charged with developing a set of recommendations for libraries using the
     TEI Guidelines in electronic text encoding. This group included the following representatives from six libraries:
</p>

<ul>
      <li>Perry Willett, Indiana University (chair)</li>
      <li>LeeEllen Friedland, Library of Congress</li>
      <li>Nancy Kushigian, University of California, Davis</li>
      <li>Christina Powell, University of Michigan</li>
      <li>David Seaman, University of Virginia</li>
      <li>Natalia Smith, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</li>
     </ul>
    

    <p>At the ALA mid-winter (January 1999), the DLF task force revised a draft set of best practices, called
     TEI Text Encoding in Libraries: Guidelines for Best Practices (referred to as <i>TEI in Libraries
      Guidelines</i>). The revised recommendations were circulated to the conference working group in May
     1999 and presented at the joint annual meeting of the Association of Computers and the Humanities and
     Association of Literary and Linguistic Computing in June 1999. <a href="tei-old.htm">Version 1.0</a> was circulated for comments in
     August 1999. These guidelines were endorsed by the DLF, and have been used by many digital libraries,
     including those of the task force members, as a model for their own local best practices. Libraries,
     museums and end-users have benefitted from a set of best practices for electronic text in a number of
     ways, including better interoperability between electronic text collections, better documented practices
     among digital libraries, and a starting point for discussion of best practices with commercial publishers
     regarding electronic text creation.</p>

    <p>Written in 1998, this first iteration of <i>TEI in Libraries Guidelines</i> made no mention of XML,
     XSLT, or any of the other powerful tools that have now become common parlance and practice in creating
     digital documents and collections. Based on these important changes in markup technology, it came to the
     attention of the DLF and members of the original Task Force that the <i>TEI in Libraries Guidelines</i>
     required substantial revision. In 2002, the TEI Consortium published a new edition of the complete
      <i>TEI Guidelines</i> that conformed to XML specifications. In order to remain useful, the <i>TEI in
      Libraries Guidelines</i> had to be updated to reflect these developments.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, librarians need more guidance than the original <i>TEI in Libraries Guidelines</i>
     provided. There are many library-specific encoding issues which need to be addressed and documented to
     ensure consistency. The intention of this document is to provide recommended paths of encoding for these
     issues.</p>

    <p>In addition, these library guidelines have the potential to be much more useful if they can serve as a
     training document from which librarians can learn about text encoding and addressing particular encoding
     challenges. To fulfill this role, the guidelines require more examples and detailed explanations,
     giving documentation of the use of TEI in a library context. Librarians also need a set of standards
     and best practices for vendors and publishers who create electronic text for digital libraries, so that
     these collections adhere to the same archival standards as locally-created electronic text collections.
     With detailed guidelines that could serve as an encoding specification, librarians might encourage
     vendors to follow the principles in these standards, to facilitate the long-term preservation of
     commercially published electronic text collections, and more readily allow for cross-collection
     searching.</p>

    <p>In order to facilitate the evolution of this document, another DLF-sponsored Task Force&mdash;some
     of the representatives of which were on the original Task Force&mdash;met on October 24-25, 2003 at
     the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C.: </p>

     <ul>
      <li>Richard Gartner, Oxford University Library</li>
      <li>Matthew Gibson, University of Virginia Library</li>
      <li>Kirk Hastings, California Digital Library</li>
      <li>Christina Powell, University of Michigan</li>
      <li>Merrilee Proffitt, RLG</li>
      <li>David Seaman, Digital Library Federation</li>
      <li>Natalia Smith, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</li>
      <li>Perry Willett, Indiana University (chair)</li>
     </ul> 
     
<p>     These representatives met to revise the original <i>TEI in Libraries Guidelines</i> in order
     that they: </p>

     <ul>
      <li>reflect changes occuring within the text encoding world generally and within the TEI
       community specifically</li>
      <li>further illuminate the different levels of encoding by offering clearer and more robust
       examples.</li>
     </ul>
    

    <p>After producing <a href="tei2/tei20.htm">version 2.0</a> of the Guidelines, this group (with some changes in membership) met again 
     at the Cosmos Club on February 13-14, 2006. Those in attendance were: </p>

     <ul>
      <li>Syd Bauman, The TEI Consortium</li>
      <li>Richard Gartner, Oxford University Library (by phone)</li>
      <li>Matthew Gibson, Virginia Foundation for the Humanities (chair)</li>
      <li>Merrilee Proffitt, RLG</li>
      <li>Chris Powell, The University of Michigan</li>
      <li>David Seaman, Digital Library Federation</li>
      <li>Natasha Smith, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</li>
      <li>Perry Willett, The University of Michigan</li>
     </ul>
    

    <p>This group of continues to meet and based upon their discussions and resolutions, the following
     guidelines will continue to be updated and enhanced.</p>
   
   <a name="background"></a>
    <hr width="75%" align="center" />
<h2 align="center">II. General Overview and Comments</h2>

    <p>These recommendations are for libraries using the XML version of the TEILite DTD (teixlite).
     There are many different library text digitization projects, for different purposes. With this in mind,
     the Task Force has attempted to make these recommendations as inclusive as possible by developing a
     series of encoding levels. These levels are meant to allow for a range of practice, from wholly automated
     text creation and encoding, to encoding that requires expert content knowledge, analysis, and editing.</p>

    <p>Recommendations for Levels 1-4 are intended for projects wishing to create encoded electronic text with
     structural markup, but minimal semantic or content markup. Also, the encoding levels are cumulative:
     encoding requirements at each level incorporate the requirements of lower levels. Levels 1-4 allow the
     conversion and encoding of texts to be performed without the assistance of deep content knowledge and can
     be enriched with more markup at any time. Level 5, in contrast, requires scholarly analysis. </p>

    <p>These recommendations are concerned with the text portion of a TEI-encoded document. While there are
     modest requirements for including certain information about encoding level in the TEI Header, a separate
     set of recommendations, now integrated into this document, was developed to address issues concerning TEI Header 
     contents to MARC-format bibliographic data (see the <a href="#teiheader">&lt;teiHeader&gt;</a> Document
     from Working Group 1).</p>
   

   <a name="genrec"></a>
    <hr width="75%" align="center" />

<h2 align="center">III. General Recommendations</h2>

    <p>Note: all recommendations that follow are based on P4:2004.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>The encoding level (as described in this document) should be recorded in the
      &lt;editorialDecl&gt; in the TEI Header, along with an explanation of any deviation from the
      recommendations.</li>
     <li>Electronic text at all levels of encoding should begin with the transcription of the first word on
      the first leaf of the original work. It may be impractical or undesirable to transcribe and encode
      certain features of the text, such as publisher's advertisements or indexes, but if at all possible,
      they should be included as links to page images. Any omissions of material found in the original work
      should be noted in the &lt;editorialDecl&gt; in the TEI Header.</li>
     <li>File naming should follow ISO 9660 conventions: 8-character filenames, 3-character extensions,
      using A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscores and hyphens. The rationale behind this suggestion is that when moving
      texts across different platforms (DOS for instance), some systems will truncate beyond the eighth
      character.</li>
     <li>We recommend the use of numbered divisions throughout the electronic text, always beginning with
      &lt;div1&gt; (we prefer that &lt;div0&gt; not be used since the TEI Guidelines does not
      make it available in &lt;front&gt; or &lt;back&gt; matter). Numbered divisions present
      advantages to search and indexing software by explicitly communicating the hierarchical level of the
      section described. Texts at all levels should include at least one &lt;div1&gt;.</li>
     <li>Page breaks should be encoded using the &lt;pb/&gt; element, should demark the top of a page 
	(i.e. after &lt;pb n="7"&gt; should follow the text of page seven), and should always be contained 
	within a division.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 align="center">IV. The TEI Header (based on June 16, 2001 Draft)</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
</center>
<p>At the TEI and XML in Digital Libraries Workshop that was held at the Library of Congress in July 1998, several working groups 
were formed to consider various aspects of the Text Encoding Initiative.  Group 1 was charged to recommend some best practices 
for TEI Header content and to review the relationship between the Text Encoding Initiative header and MARC.  To this end, 
representatives of the University of Virginia Library and the University of Michigan Library gathered in Ann Arbor in early 
October 1998 to develop a recommended practice guide.  This work was assisted by similar efforts that had taken place in the United 
Kingdom under the auspices of the Oxford Text Archive the previous year.
The following document represents a draft of those recommended practices. It has been submitted to various constituencies for
comment.</p>
	

	<a name="teihead2"></a>
<hr width="75%" align="center" />
<center>
<h3>Working Assumptions</h3>
</center>
<p>A TEI Header can serve many publics.  Headers can be created in a text center and reflect the center's standards, or they can 
serve as the basis for other types of metadata system records produced by other agencies.  Headers can function in detached 
form as records in a catalog, as a title page inherent to the document, or as a source for index displays.</p>

<p>In addition, a header may describe a collection of documents, a single item, or a portion of an item.  Variances in TEI Header 
content can result from making different choices of what is being described.</p>

<p>A TEI Header may not have a one to one correspondence with a MARC record.  One TEI Header may have multiple MARC analytic records, 
or one MARC record may be used to describe a collection of TEI documents with individual headers.</p>

<p>A TEI Header serves several purposes.  It may contain an historical background on how the file has been treated.  It can extend the 
information of a classic catalog record.  The Text Center and/or cataloging agency can act as the gatekeeper for creators by 
providing standards for content.</p>

<p>Does the TEI Header act as the electronic title page or as a catalog record?  Is it integral to the document it describes or 
independent?  Depending on the community being served, the TEI elements will reflect the interest of that community.  Nonetheless, 
it is possible to describe a set of "best practices" that will produce compatible content while accommodating this variety of 
purposes.  Compatibility of content encourages a more understandable set of results when information about assorted items is 
displayed as a set of search results, a contents list, or an index, and it allows for more reasonable conversion of content 
information from TEI tags to elements of other metadata sets when this action seems advisable.</p>

<p>It is a traditional practice of librarianship to agree upon where in a document and in what order of preference one should look 
to identify the title, author, etc., of that document.  This permits a certain consistency in terminology and allows for a certain 
amount of authentication of content.  We recommend the following preferences to those who create headers and to those who attempt 
to use headers to create traditional catalog records that are compliant with AACR2 and ISBD(ER) rules.</p>

<p>As a member of the academic community, the header creator/editor has a responsibility to verify, whenever humanly possible, the 
intellectual source for an electronic document that presents itself without any information regarding its source or authorship.</p>


<h4>Chief Sources of Information for Several Types of Electronic Resources Are:</h4>
<ul>	<li>1. For an electronic document with a digitized title page (without a header), prefer
		<ul>
			<li>a) Chief source of information = information coded as title page</li>
			<li>b) Use added information from an originating paper document if absolutely certain it is the source</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>2.   Electronic document with header (without a title page)
		<ul>
			<li>a) Chief source of information = supplied and verified header<a href="#n1"> [*]</a>
</li>
			<li>b) Use information from paper document if absolutely certain it is the source</li>
		</ul>
	
	</li>
	<li>3.   Electronic document with header and title page
		<ul>
			<li>a) Chief source of information = supplied header (if verified)<a href="#teihead1"> [*]</a>
</li>
			<li>b) If header is not verified, use title page as chief source</li>
			<li>c) Use information from paper document if absolutely certain it is the source</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>4.   If neither header nor title page is present and there is no evidence of a source document, the header creator
		<ul>
			<li>a) May assign a title and author if appropriate</li>
			<li>b) Enclose the information in brackets, using the standard English language convention for editorial interjections</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
	<li>5.   If neither header nor title page is present but the header creator has satisfactory evidence of an originating source, that 
document should be used as the chief source of information for the title and author of the header.  If the source cannot be fully 
verified as to edition, authorship, etc., this fact should be clearly indicated in a note in the &lt;fileDesc&gt;.
	</li>
</ul>	

<p>
<a name="n1"></a>
*Verified means that the cataloger/editor has established for him/herself that the information represented as title information is an 
accurate representation of content.

<h2>V. Encoding Levels</h2>
</center>
    <a name="level1"></a>
     <hr width="75%" align="center" />
<center>
<h3>V.1. LEVEL 1: Fully Automated Conversion and Encoding</h3>
</center>

     <p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To create electronic text with the primary purpose of keyword searching
      and linking to page images. The primary advantage in using the teixlite DTD at this level is that a TEI
      Header is attached to the text file.</p>

     <p>
<b>Rationale:</b> The text is subordinate to the page image, and is not intended to
      stand alone as an electronic text (without page images).</p>

     <p>Texts at Level 1 can be created and encoded by fully automated means, using uncorrected OCR of page
      images ("dirty OCR"), exporting from existing electronic text files, or actually not including any text
      at all. Only those elements that are necessary to divide the text from the header and facilitate linking to
      page images are used. Encoding is performed automatically based on artifacts of the OCR or other
      document creation process (page breaks, for example) and metadata collected during the imaging or
      preparation process. This encoding is both minimal and reliable, and does not typically require
      extensive review of each page of each text.</p>

     <p>Level 1 texts are not intended to be adequate for textual analysis; they are more likely to be suited
      to the goals of a preservation unit or mass digitization initiative. Though their encoding is minimal,
      Level 1 texts are fully valid XML texts. In addition to taking advantage of the TEI Header, using the
      teixlite DTD--with the consistency suggested by these guidelines--allows Level 1 texts to be compatible 
      with more richly encoded teixlite texts (that also follow these guidelines) for
      searching, for example. Further encoding based on document structures or content analysis can be added
      to a Level 1 text at any time.</p>

     <p>
      <b>Level 1 is most suitable for projects with the following characteristics:</b>
     </p>

     <ul>
      <li>a large volume of material is to be made available online quickly</li>
      <li>a digital image of each page is desired</li>
      <li>no manual intervention will be performed in the text creation process</li>
      <li>the material is of interest to a large community of users who wish to read texts that allow
       keyword searching</li>
      <li>sophisticated search and display capabilities based on the structure of the text are not necessary</li>
      <li>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option for a higher level of
       tagging to be added at a later date</li>
     </ul>

<h3>V.2. LEVEL 2: Minimal Encoding</h3>
</center>

     <p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To create electronic text for full-text searching, linking to page
      images, and identifying simple structural hierarchy to improve navigation.</p>

     <p>
<b>Rationale</b>: The text is subordinate to the page image, though navigational markers
      (textual divisions, heads) are captured. The text could stand alone as electronic text (without page
      images) if the accuracy of its contents is suitable to its intended use and it is not necessary to
      display low-level typographic or structural information. Level 2 requires a set of elements more
      granular than those of Level 1, including bibliographic or structural information below the monographic
      or volume level.</p>

     <p>Though texts at Level 2 can be created and encoded by automated means, based on the typographic
      elements in the electronic file (for example, bold centered text at the top of the page surrounded by
      whitespace indicates a new chapter head, and thus a new division), it is not likely to be absolutely
      reliable across a large body of material. Level 2 encoding requires some human intervention to identify
      each textual division and heading. Level 2 texts do not require any specialist knowledge or manual
      intervention below the section level.</p>

     <p>Level 2 texts are not intended to be displayed separately from their page images. Level 2 encoding of
      sections and heads provides greater navigational possibilities than Level 1 encoding, and enables
      searching to be restricted within particular textual divisions (for example, searching for two phrases
      within the same chapter).</p>

     <p>
      <b>Level 2 is most suitable for projects with the following characteristics:</b>
     </p>

     <ul>
      <li>a large volume of material is to be made available online quickly</li>
      <li>a digital image of each page is desired</li>
      <li>the material is of interest to a large community of users who wish to read texts that allow
       keyword searching</li>
      <li>rudimentary search and display capabilities based on the large structures of the text are desired</li>
      <li>each text will be checked to ensure that divisions and headers are properly identified</li>
      <li>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option for a higher level of
       tagging to be added at a later date</li>
     </ul>

<h3>V.3. LEVEL 3: Simple Analysis</h3>
</center>

     <p>
<b>Purpose:</b> To create text that can stand alone as electronic text and identifies
      hierarchy and typography without content analysis being of primary importance.</p>

     <p>
<b>Rationale:</b> Level 3 texts can be created from scratch or by the relatively easy
      conversion of existing HTML or word-processing documents. Encoding offers the advantage of the TEI
      Header, interoperability with other TEI collections, and extensibility to higher levels of encoding.
      Level 3 generally requires some human editing, but the features to be encoded are determined by the
      appearance of the text and not specialized content analysis.</p>

     <p>Level 3 texts identify front and back matter, and all paragraph breaks. The finer granularity of
      tagging these features, as well as figures, notes, and all changes of typography, allows a range of
      options for display, delivery, and searching. For example, one has the option of identifying and,
      therefore, specifying the display charactersitics of different typographic styles, and regularizing the
      display and placement of note text.</p>

     <p>Level 3 texts can stand alone as text without page images and, therefore, can be uploaded, downloaded
      and delivered quickly, and require less storage space than digital collections with page images.
      However, the simple level of structural anaylsis and absence of specialized content analysis reflected
      in Level 3 tagging may make it desirable for some, depending on project priorities, to include page
      images in order to provide users with a fuller set of resources.</p>

     <p>
      <b>Level 3 is most suitable for projects with the following characteristics:</b>
     </p>

     <ul>
      <li>the material is of interest to a large community of users who wish to read texts that allow
       keyword searching</li>
      <li>some sophistication of display, delivery, and searching based on structure of the text is desired</li>
      <li>each text will be checked to ensure that tagging decisions have been made appropriately</li>
      <li>the users of the texts may have limited storage or display capabilities</li>
      <li>the creator of the texts has limited or no ability to provide content specialists to analyze, tag,
       or review texts</li>
      <li>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option for a higher level of
       tagging to be added at a later date</li>
     </ul>

     <p>NOTE ON &lt;note&gt;:</p>

     <p>It may be desirable to move footnotes from their original location in the text. If left at the bottom
      of a page, a note may become included in another paragraph or section of the encoded text, and thus
      separated from its reference. There are options for placement of footnotes if they are moved:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>Inline. The note is inserted at the point of reference. An n attribute records the value of the
       note reference if there is one.</li>
      <li>End-of-Division. Notes moved to the end of the division</li>
     </ul>

<h3>V.4. LEVEL 4: Basic Content Analysis</h3>
</center>

     <p>
<b>Purpose</b>: To create text that can stand alone as electronic text, identifies
      hierarchy and typography, specifies function of textual and structural elements, and describes the
      nature of the content and not merely its appearance. This level is not meant to encode or identify all
      structural, semantic or bibliographic features of the text.</p>

     <p>
<b>Rationale</b>: Greater description of function and content allows for:</p>

     <ul>
      <li>flexibility of display and delivery</li>
      <li>sophisticated searching within specified textual and structural elements</li>
      <li>combining the broadest range of uses and audiences</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Texts encoded at Level 4 are able to stand alone as part of a library collection, and do not require
      page images in order for them to be read by students, scholars and general readers. This level of TEI
      encoding allows them to be displayed or printed in a variety of ways suitable for classroom or scholarly
      use.</p>

     <p>Level 4 texts contain elements and attributes that describe content. For example, lines of verse are
      tagged with &lt;l&gt;; the &lt;p&gt; element is reserved for true paragraphs. Features of
      the text that may contribute to meaning, such as indentation of verse lines and typographic change, are
      preserved. These are textual features that are not encoded at lower levels and that allow the text to be
      used and understood fully independent of images.</p>

     <p>The ability to stand alone as text means that Level 4 texts are more nimble and robust for exercises
      such as format repurposing and textual analysis.</p>

     <p>Finally, functionally accurate tagging in Level 4 texts allows them to be searched or displayed in
      sophisticated ways. For example, a searcher could limit his or her search in a dramatic text to stage
      directions or to the speeches of a particular character. In a volume of poetry published by
      subscription, a search could be confined to names that appear in lists, thus limiting a search to names
      of people who subscribed to a particular volume. This ability to limit searches becomes more significant
      as textbases become larger, and thus is of great importance to the library community as it attempts to
      build into the initial design and implementation of textbases features needed to enhance
      interoperability.</p>

     <p>
      <b>Level 4 is most suitable for projects with the following characteristics:</b>
     </p>

     <ul>
      <li>sophisticated search and retrieval capabilities are desired</li>
      <li>the texts will be used for textual analysis</li>
      <li>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option for a higher level of
       tagging to be added by the scholarly community at a later date</li>
      <li>the users of the texts may have limited storage or display capabilities</li>
     </ul>

     
      <h4>General Level 4 Recommendations:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>Typographically distinct text should be encoded as &lt;foreign&gt;,
        &lt;title&gt;, or &lt;emph&gt; as appropriate. Any ambiguous emphasized text should be
        encoded as &lt;hi&gt; (e.g. &lt;hi rend="bold"&gt;).</li>
       <li>It is recommended that the &lt;sic&gt; element be used to indicate typographic errors,
        with corrections noted as the value of the corr attribute.</li>
       <li>&lt;titlePage&gt; should include the verso if present, divided by &lt;pb
        n="verso"/&gt;. Tables of contents, errata, subscription lists, "other titles by the same author"
        should be included in a separate numbered division, as a &lt;list&gt; with &lt;item&gt;s.
        Frontispieces should be encoded as a &lt;figure&gt;, within a separate numbered division and
        &lt;p&gt;.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Level 4 Prose:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>Letters that occur within the text body provide some challenges. It is recommended that quoted
        letters that occur as part of a text (and not collections of letters themselves) be encoded within
        &lt;q&gt;&lt;text&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div1 type="letter"&gt;, with
        &lt;opener&gt;, &lt;dateline&gt;, &lt;salute&gt;, &lt;signed&gt;,
        &lt;closer&gt; included as appropriate.</li>
       <li>Quotations that do not occur inline, but are set off typographically in some way, should be
        encoded as &lt;q&gt;.</li>
       <li>Notes are to be encoded as described in Level 3.</li>
       <li>&lt;argument&gt;, &lt;opener&gt;, &lt;epigraph&gt;,
        &lt;closer&gt;, &lt;trailer&gt;, &lt;add&gt;, &lt;del&gt;,
        &lt;unclear&gt; as appropriate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Level 4 Drama:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>Cast lists should be encoded as &lt;list&gt;s, with &lt;item&gt;s.</li>
       <li>Speeches are encoded as &lt;sp&gt;, with speakers identified within
        &lt;speaker&gt; elements; stage directions are encoded as &lt;stage&gt; and enclose
        block level content describing scenery, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Level 4 Oral History:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>Speakers in interviews can be identified in the &lt;teiHeader&gt; in several ways. 
	<ul>
		<li>In the &lt;profileDesc&gt;, in the &lt;particDesc&gt; in a &lt;list&gt;, with &lt;name&gt; inside of &lt;item&gt;s.</li>
		<li>As a list of author &lt;name&gt;s within &lt;fileDesc&gt;&lt;titleStmt&gt;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In either method, use an id= on the &lt;name&gt; element to uniquely identify the individual participant</li>
       <li>Questions and answers from interviewees and interviewers are encoded as &lt;sp&gt;, 
	with speakers identified within &lt;speaker&gt; elements with a who= attribute the value of which 
	corresponds to the id= in the list of interview participants.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Level 4 Verse:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>All verse, even poems without separate stanzas or verse paragraphs, should be contained within a
        line group element &lt;lg&gt;. This will assist with automated processing and retrieval.</li>
       <li>It is common to see informal divisions within poems, noted by a string of asterisks or periods.
        These should be encoded as &lt;milestone/&gt;s with attribute values of unit="typography" and
        n="()" indicating the character used and its occurrence, &lt;milestone unit="typography"
        n="******"/&gt;.</li>
       <li>&lt;l&gt; It is recommended that indentation be recorded and that the rend attribute be
        used to do this.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>
     

     
      <h4>Level 4 Front and Back Matter:</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>It is recommended that all prefaces, tables of contents, afterwords, appendices, endnotes and
        apparatus be encoded. For publisher's advertisements, indexes, and glossaries or other front or back
        matter that isn't considered of primary importance to the text, there are three options:<ul>
         <li>Fully transcribe and encode</li>
         <li>Link to page images (may include an unencoded transcription)</li>
         <li>Omit, noted in &lt;editorialDesc&gt;</li>
        </ul>
</li>

<h3>V.5. LEVEL 5: Scholarly Encoding Projects</h3>
</center>
     <p>Level 5 texts are those that require subject knowledge, and encode semantic, linguistic, prosodic or
      other elements beyond a basic structural level.</p>

<h2>VI. General Guidelines for Attribute Usage</h2>
</center>
    <p>Like divisional markers, attributes should be specified in a hierarchy of order. The rationale for this
     hierarchy of order is that if you are using procedural scripting languages to transform or manipulate
     text, it is much easier to have consitent and predictable attribute sequences than not. The basic rule is
     that broader and more global information be defined before those attributes that further qualify or
     constrict that information:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Attributes should always be specified in the following order, when present: type=, id=, target=, n=, followed by
       all other attributes in alphabetical order, except that rend= is always last.</li>
      
      <li>"type": If you are in a situation that requires you to define the "type" of structure you are
       using, the "type" attribute must always be specified first. The logic behind this follows some basic and
       yet existential thinking such that a thing cannot really be given an age or individual identity without
       our first knowing what kind of thing we're talking about. Constructing a list of acceptable attribute
       values for type that could find wide agreement is impossible. Instead, it is recommended that projects
       describe the type attribute values used in their texts in the project documentation and that this list
       be made available to people using the texts. See <i>ABC for Book Collectors</i> by John Carter
       (7th edition, New Castle, DE:Oak Knoll Books, 1995) for a list of standard names and definitions of
       bibliographic features of printed books. For those elements where type is not required, such as
       &lt;head&gt; and &lt;title&gt;, use the attribute values for subtitles and additional
       titles, but not main titles.<br /> Example: &lt;div1 type="volume"&gt;</li>

      <li>"n": Sometimes a "n" (number) attribute can be used by itself. For instance in the case of
       pagebreaks:<br /> Example: &lt;pb n="456"&gt;</li>
      
      <li>"id": If you are in a situation that requires you to uniquely identify an element that will be used to
       reference another specific location in one or more texts<br /> Example: &lt;note id="n5" n="5"&gt;</li>

      <li>"target": follows the same rules and dictates as the "id" attribute descriptor. In fact, "target"
       and "id" are often used in conjunction with one another as in the case of footnotes where the
       &lt;note target="n5" n="5"&gt; points from a specific place in the text to the &lt;note
       id="n5" n="5"&gt; which contains the actual information of the footnote itself.</li>

      <li>"entity": The "entity" attribute is simply the way a figure points or refers to its target name<br /> 
Example: &lt;figure entity="TwaFifrn"&gt; points to an image with a name and format such as TwaFifrn.jpg.</li>

      <li>"rend": While rend is mostly used by itself to describe typographical rendering, there are some
       cases where it can be listed with other attribute descriptors. And in those cases, "rend" will be
       listed last in hierarchic order. Difficulty using rend attributes occurs when it is desirable to record
       more than one rendition feature. With this in mind, it is recommended that projects employ the
       following adaptation of "rendition ladders", a concept developed at the <a href="http://www.wwp.brown.edu/">Brown
        University Women Writers Project</a> &lt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu&gt;. This system allows for sets 
	of multiple renditional features to be included in one rend= value. Rendition ladders consist of categories of
       renditional features with values of each of those features enclosed in parentheses.<br /> rend should only be 
	used to override a default value. For instance, if all text encoded as &lt;hi&gt; is defined as being
       rendered in italics, there is no reason to encode text as
       
        <p>&lt;hi rend="font(italics)"&gt;</p>
       
       Combining renditional features would result in an element
       with attributes such as
       
        <p>&lt;l rend="font(italics)align(right)"&gt;</p>
       </li>
      <li>font <br />italics, bold, fsc (full and smallcaps), smallcap, underlined, gothic</li>
      <li>align <br />right, left, center, block</li>
      <li>indent <br />Values in parentheses should indicate the number of tabstops to be indented, e.g.,
       &lt;l rend="indent(1)"&gt;</li>
      <li>lang <br />Use ISO639-2 three-character language codes.</li>
     </ul>
