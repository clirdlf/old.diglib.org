<P>At the <A 
href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/misc/ssp/workshops/teidlf/index.html">TEI and XML 
in Digital Libraries Workshop</A> held at the Library of Congress on June 
30-July 1, 1998, three working groups were formed. Group 2 was charged with 
developing a set of recommendations for libraries using the TEI Guidelines in 
electronic text encoding. Representatives from six libraries met at the Library 
of Congress on November 12-13, 1998. The Task Force met again at ALA mid-winter 
(January 1999) to incorporate comments and finalize the draft. The revised 
recommendations were circulated to the conference working group in May 1999 and 
presented at the joint annual meeting of the Association of Computers and the 
Humanities and Association of Literary and Linguistic Computing in June 1999. 
Version 1.0 was circulated for comments in August 1999. </P>

<H2><A name="recommendations">III. Background</A></H2>
<P>Our recommendations are for libraries using the TEILite DTD v1.6. There are 
many different library text digitization projects, for different purposes. With 
this in mind, the Task Force has attempted to make these recommendations as 
inclusive as possible by developing a series of encoding levels. These levels 
are meant to allow for a range of practice, from wholly automated text creation 
and encoding, to encoding that requires expert content knowledge, analysis, and 
editing.</P>
<P>Encoding levels 1-4 require no expert knowledge of content. Level 5, in 
contrast, requires scholarly analysis. Levels 1-4 allow the conversion and 
encoding of texts to be performed without the assistance of content experts and 
can be enriched with more markup at any time. Recommendations for Levels 1-4 are 
intended for projects wishing to create encoded electronic text with structural 
markup, but minimal semantic or content markup. Also, the encoding levels are 
cumulative: encoding requirements at each level incorporate the requirements of 
lower levels.</P>
<P>These recommendations are concerned with the text portion of a TEI-encoded 
document. While there are modest requirements for including certain information 
about encoding level in the TEI Header, a separate set of recommendations has 
been developed to address issues concerning TEI Header contents to MARC-format 
bibliographic data (see <A 
href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/libhome/ocu/teiguide.html">TEI/MARC Best 
Practices</A> Document from Working Group 1).</P>

<H2><A name="genrec">IV. General Recommendations</A></H2>
<OL>
  <LI>The encoding level (as described in this document) should be recorded in 
  the &lt;editorialDecl&gt;, along with an explanation of any deviation from the 
  recommendations. 
  <LI>Electronic text at all levels of encoding should begin with the 
  transcription of the first word on the first leaf of the original work. It may 
  be impractical or undesirable to transcribe and encode certain features of the 
  text, such as publisher's advertisements or indexes, but if at all possible, 
  they should be included as links to page images. Any omissions of material 
  found in the original work should be noted in the &lt;editorialDecl&gt; in the 
  TEI Header. 
  <LI>File naming should follow ISO 9660 conventions: 8-character filenames, 
  3-character extensions, using A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscores and hyphens. 
  <LI>Numbered &lt;DIV&gt;s present advantages to search and indexing software 
  by explicitly communicating the hierarchical level of the section described. 
  One anomaly of the TEI Guidelines is that &lt;DIV0&gt; is not available in 
  &lt;FRONT&gt; or &lt;BACK&gt; matter. Therefore, we recommend the use of 
  numbered &lt;DIV&gt;s throughout the electronic text, always beginning with 
  &lt;DIV1&gt;. Texts at all levels should include at least one &lt;DIV1&gt;. 
  <LI>Page breaks &lt;PB&gt; should occur at the top of the page, and entirely 
  within any DIV. </LI></OL>

<UL>
  <LI><B><A name="level1">V.1. LEVEL 1: Fully Automated Conversion and 
  Encoding</A></B> <BR>
  <P><B>Purpose:</B> To create electronic text with the primary purpose of 
  keyword searching and linking to page images. The primary advantage in using 
  the TEILite DTD at this level is that a TEI Header is attached to the text 
  file.</P>
  <P><B>Rationale:</B> That text is subordinate to the page image, and is not 
  intended to stand alone as an electronic text (without page images).</P>
  <P>Texts at Level 1 can be created and encoded by fully automated means, using 
  uncorrected OCR of page images ("dirty OCR"), or exporting from existing 
  electronic text files. Only those tags that are necessary to divide the text 
  from the header and facilitate linking to page images are used. Encoding is 
  performed automatically based on artifacts of the OCR or other document 
  creation process (page breaks, for example) and metadata collected during the 
  imaging or preparation process. This encoding is both minimal and reliable, 
  and does not typically require extensive review of each page of each text.</P>
  <P>Level 1 texts are not intended to be adequate for textual analysis; they 
  are more likely to be suited to the goals of a preservation unit or mass 
  digitization initiative. Though their encoding is minimal, Level 1 texts are 
  fully valid SGML texts. In addition to taking advantage of the TEI Header, 
  using the TEILite DTD allows Level 1 texts to be compatible with more richly 
  encoded TEILite texts for searching, for example. Further encoding based on 
  document structures or content analysis can be added to a Level 1 text at any 
  time.</P>
  <P><B>Level 1 is most suitable for projects with the following 
  characteristics:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>a large volume of material is to be made available online quickly 
    <LI>a digital image of each page is desired 
    <LI>no manual intervention will be performed in the text creation process 
    <LI>the material is of interest to a large community of users who wish to 
    read texts that allow keyword searching 
    <LI>sophisticated search and display capabilities based on the structure of 
    the text are not necessary 
    <LI>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option 
    for a higher level of tagging to be added at a later date </LI></UL>

  <LI><A name="level2"><B>V.2. LEVEL 2: Minimal Encoding</B></A> 
  <P><B>Purpose:</B> To create electronic text for keyword searching, linking to 
  page images, and identifying simple structural hierarchy to improve 
  navigation.</P>
  <P><B>Rationale</B>: The text is subordinate to the page image, though 
  navigational markers (textual divisions, heads) are captured. The text could 
  stand alone as electronic text (without page images) if the accuracy of its 
  contents is suitable to its intended use and it is not necessary to display 
  low-level typographic or structural information. Level 2 requires a set of 
  elements more granular than those of Level 1, including bibliographic or 
  structural information below the monographic or volume level, but still does 
  not require a specialist to identify.</P>
  <P>Though texts at Level 2 can be created and encoded by automated means, 
  based on the typographic elements in the electronic file (for example, bold 
  centered text at the top of the page surrounded by whitespace indicates a new 
  chapter head, and thus a new division), it is not likely to be absolutely 
  reliable across a large body of material. Level 2 encoding requires some human 
  intervention to identify each textual division and heading. Level 2 texts do 
  not require any specialist knowledge or manual intervention below the section 
  level.</P>
  <P>Level 2 texts can be displayed separately from their page images. Even when 
  displayed with page images, Level 2 encoding of sections and heads provides 
  greater navigational possibilities than Level 1 encoding, and enables 
  searching to be restricted within particular textual divisions (for example, 
  searching for two phrases within the same chapter). 
  <P><B>Level 2 is most suitable for projects with the following 
  characteristics:</B> 
  <UL>

  <LI><A name="level3"><B>V.3. LEVEL 3: Simple Analysis</B></A> 
  <P><B>Purpose:</B> To create text that can stand alone as electronic text and 
  identifies hierarchy and typography without content analysis being of primary 
  importance.</P>
  <P><B>Rationale:</B> Level 3 texts can be created from scratch or by the 
  relatively easy conversion of existing HTML or word-processing documents. 
  Encoding offers the advantage of the TEI Header, interoperability with other 
  TEI collections, and extensibility to higher levels of encoding. Level 3 
  generally requires some human editing, but the features to be encoded are 
  determined by the appearance of the text and not specialized content 
  analysis.</P>
  <P>Level 3 texts identify front and back matter, and all paragraph breaks. The 
  finer granularity of tagging these features, as well as figures, notes, and 
  all changes of typography, allows a range of options for display, delivery, 
  and searching. For example, one has the option of identifying and, therefore, 
  specifying the display charactersitics of different typographic styles, and 
  regularizing the display and placement of note text. 
  <P>Level 3 texts can stand alone as text without page images and, therefore, 
  can be uploaded, downloaded and delivered quickly, and require less storage 
  space than digital collections with page images. However, the simple level of 
  structural anaylsis and absence of specialized content analysis reflected in 
  Level 3 tagging may make it desirable for some, depending on project 
  priorities, to include page images in order to provide users with a fuller set 
  of resources. 
  <P><B>Level 3 is most suitable for projects with the following 
  characteristics:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>the material is of interest to a large community if users who wish to 
    read texts that allow keyword searching 
    <LI>some sophistication of display, delivery, and searching based on 
    structure of the text is desired 
    <LI>each text will be checked to ensure that tagging decisions have been 
    made appropriately 
    <LI>the users of the texts may have limited storage or display capabilities 
    <LI>the creator of the texts has limited or no ability to provide content 
    specialists to analyze, tag, or review texts 
    <LI>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option 
    for a higher level of tagging to be added at a later date </LI></UL>

  <LI><A name="level4"><B>V.4. LEVEL 4: Basic Content Analysis</B></A> 
  <P><B>Purpose</B>: To create text that can stand alone as electronic text, 
  identifies hierarchy and typography, specifies function of textual and 
  structural elements, and describes the nature of the content and not merely 
  its appearance. This level is not meant to encode or identify all structural, 
  semantic or bibliographic features of the text.</P>
  <P><B>Rationale</B>: Greater description of function and content allows 
  for:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>flexibility of display and delivery 
    <LI>sophisticated searching within specified textual and structural elements 

    <LI>combining the broadest range of uses and audiences </LI></UL>
  <P>Texts encoded at Level 4 are able to stand alone as part of a library 
  collection, and do not require images in order for them to be read by 
  students, scholars and general readers. This level of TEI encoding allows them 
  to be displayed or printed in a variety of ways suitable for classroom or 
  scholarly use. 
  <P>Level 4 texts contain tags and attributes that describe content. For 
  example, lines of verse are tagged with &lt;L&gt;; the &lt;P&gt; tag is 
  reserved for true paragraphs. Attributes of the text that contribute to 
  meaning are preserved, such as indentation of lines of verse and typography. 
  These are textual features that are not encoded at lower levels and that allow 
  the text to be used and understood fully independent of images. 
  <P>The ability to stand alone as text means that Level 4 texts can be 
  uploaded, downloaded, and delivered quickly, and require less storage space 
  than collections with page images. 
  <P>Finally, functionally accurate tagging in Level 4 texts allows them to be 
  searched or displayed in sophisticated ways. For example, a searcher could 
  limit his or her search in a dramatic text to stage directions or to the 
  speeches of a particular character. In a volume of poetry published by 
  subscription, a search could be confined to names that appear in lists, thus 
  limiting a search to names of people who subscribed to a particular volume. 
  This ability to limit searches becomes more significant as textbases become 
  larger, and thus is of great importance to the library community as it 
  attempts to build into the initial design and implementation of textbases 
  features needed to enhance interoperability. 
  <P><B>Level 4 is most suitable for projects with the following 
  characteristics:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>the users of the texts may have limited storage or display capabilities 
    <LI>sophisticated search and display capabilities are desired 
    <LI>the collection is of interest to a currently existing, well defined 
    community of users, such as that that would constitute a market for any 
    published text or collection of texts 
    <LI>the collection is rare and not available to users in print or other 
    electronic formats 
    <LI>the texts will be used for pedagogical or scholarly purposes, not just 
    as reading copies 
    <LI>extensibility is desired; that is, one desires to keep open the option 
    for a higher level of tagging to be added by the scholarly community at a 
    later date </LI></UL>
  <P>In considering such a level 4 TEI digitization project, an academic library 
  should consult with faculty members and collection bibliographers, and ask the 
  following question: Is this collection of texts one that the library should 
  purchase if it were available commercially? If so, the benefits of a Level 4 
  project are many, for the result is a freely available collection of texts 
  owned and administered by the library community, thus free of licensing 
  restrictions and on-going access charges.

  <HR>

  <LI><B>General Level 4 Recommendations:</B> 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>V.4.1. Emphasized text should be encoded as &lt;FOREIGN&gt;, 
    &lt;TITLE&gt;, &lt;EMPH&gt;, as appropriate. Any ambiguous emphasized text 
    should be encoded as &lt;HI&gt;. 
    <LI>V.4.2. It is recommended that the &lt;SIC&gt; element be used to 
    indicate typographic errors, with corrections noted as the value of the CORR 
    attribute. 
    <LI>V.4.3. &lt;TITLEPAGE&gt; should include the verso if present, divided 
    with by &lt;PB N="verso"&gt;. Tables of contents, errata, subscription 
    lists, "other titles by the same author" should be included in a separate 
    numbered DIV, as a &lt;LIST&gt; with &lt;ITEM&gt;s. Frontispieces should be 
    encoded as a &lt;FIGURE&gt;, within a separate numbered &lt;DIV&gt; and 
    &lt;P&gt;. </LI></UL>
  <P>
  <HR>

  <LI><B>Level 4 Prose:</B> 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>V.4.4. Letters that occur within the text body provide some challenges. 
    It is recommended that quoted letters that occur as part of a text (and not 
    collections of letters themselves) be encoded within 
    &lt;q&gt;&lt;text&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div1 type="letter"&gt;, with 
    &lt;opener&gt;, &lt;dateline&gt;, &lt;salute&gt;, &lt;signed&gt;,

    <LI>V.4.11 It is common to see informal divisions within poems, noted by a 
    string of asterisks or periods. These should be encoded as 
    &lt;MILESTONE&gt;s with attribute values of UNIT="typography"and N=

  <LI>TYPE <BR>Constructing a list of acceptable attribute values for TYPE that 
  could find wide agreement is impossible. Instead, it is recommended that 
  projects describe the TYPE attribute values used in their texts in the project 
  documentation and that this list be made available to people using the texts. 
  See <CITE>ABC for Book Collectors</CITE> by John Carter (7th edition, New 
  Castle, DE: Oak Knoll Books, 1995) for a list of standard names and 
  definitions of bibliographic features of printed books. For those elements 
  where TYPE is not required, such as &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;TITLE&gt;, use the 
  attribute values for subtitles and additional titles, but not main titles. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>REND <BR>Difficulty using REND attributes occurs when it is desirable to 
  record more than one rendition feature. With this in mind, it is recommended 
  that projects employ the following adaptation of "rendition ladders", a 
  concept developed at the <A href="http://www.wwp.brown.edu/">Brown Women 
  Writers Project</A> &lt;http://www.wwp.brown.edu&gt;. This concept allows for 
  strings of rendition features to be included as one REND value. Rendition 
  ladders consist of categories of renditions, with further defined values 
  included in parentheses. <BR>REND should only be used to override a default 
  value. For instance, if all text encoded as &lt;HI&gt; is defined as being 
  rendered in italics, there is no reason to encode text as <BR><BR>&lt;HI 
  REND="font(italics)"&gt; <BR><BR>Combining attributes would result in a tag 
  with attributes such as this: <BR><BR>&lt;L 
  REND="font(italics)align(right)"&gt; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>FONT <BR>italics, bold, fsc (full and smallcaps), smallcap, underlined, 
  gothic 
  <P></P>
  <LI>ALIGN <BR>right, left, center, block 
  <P></P>
  <LI>INDENT <BR>Values in parentheses should indicate the number of tabstops to 
  be indented, e.g., &lt;L REND="indent(1)"&gt; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>LANG <BR>Use ISO639-2 three-character language codes.
