Effectively</font></h2>

<h3 align="left">Institutional Policies and Practices for the
Long-term Maintenance of Digital Materials</h3>

<p>The DLF and RLG have formed a task force to advance the
understanding of digital preservation policy and practice. Few
institutions have formal policies in place but many have made
commitments to preserve digital materials and are adopting
practices to support the handling and long-term maintenance of
such materials. The goal of the task force is to identify and
document these practices so that DLF and RLG can identify what
kinds of technical, economic, and organizational barriers
institutions are facing, and what kinds of actions are needed to
reduce those barriers.</p>

<p>The task group will gather and analyze existing digital
preservation policies and practice descriptions for the following
three classes of electronic materials:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>institutional records in digital form

<p></p>
</li>

<li>locally digitized materials

<p></p>
</li>

<li>electronic publications</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left">Management Forums</h3>

<p>In June, DLF staff made final preparations for the Digital
Library Federation's first semi-annual Forum on Digital Library
Practices, scheduled for July 1999. The agenda included
presentations on authentication and authorization systems,
digital repositories, finding aids, page image navigation
systems, and naming systems.</p>

  

<h2 align="left"><font color="#006633">Outreach
Initiatives</font></h2>

<h3 align="left">Publications</h3>

<p>In February 1999, the Digital Library Federation issued its
first publication, Enabling Access in Digital Libraries: A Report
on a Workshop on Access Management, edited by Caroline Arms with
Judith Klavans and Donald Waters.</p>

<p>The second publication in the DLF series, Preserving the
Whole: A Two-track Approach to Rescuing Social Science Data and
Metadata, by Ann Green and JoAnn Dionne, appeared in June
1999.</p>

<h3 align="left">Site Visits</h3>

<p>Donald Waters visited the California Digital Library and the
University of Chicago libraries. Rebecca Graham visited Carnegie
Mellon libraries, the Yale University Library, California Digital
Library, the libraries at the University of California at
Berkeley, the Princeton University Library, the Library of
Congress, and the Columbia University Library.</p>

  

<h2 align="left"><font color="#006633">Organizational
Issues</font></h2>

<h3 align="left">Executive Subcommittee</h3>

<p>An executive subcommittee of the DLF Steering Committee was
formed and began work in January with a dual purpose. First, it
is charged to help plan the Steering Committee meetings. Second,
it provides a ready source of advice for the DLF staff as needed
between Steering Committee meetings on such matters as
applications from prospective new members, specific program
plans, budgetary matters, positions that DLF should take when
consulted by outside groups, and so on. The members of the
executive subcommittee for 1999 are Paula Kaufman (chair),
Richard Lucier, Elaine Sloan, Winston Tabb, and Sarah Thomas.</p>

<h3 align="left">New Members</h3>

<p>The University of Texas at Austin joined the DLF in January.
The University of Virginia is preparing an application.</p>

<h3 align="left">Alliances</h3>

<p>CNI has joined in an alliance with DLF, on the same terms as
RLG, OCLC, and NARA. That is, CNI and DLF will develop work
jointly where their interests intersect, and Clifford Lynch will
represent CNI at Steering Committee meetings as an ally "with
voice but without vote."</p>

<h3 align="left">Staff</h3>

<p>Rebecca Graham joined the CLIR staff as DLF research associate
in September 1998. Donald Waters, director of the DLF since
October 1997, resigned on June 30, 1999, to accept the position
of program officer for scholarly communication at The Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation.</p>
