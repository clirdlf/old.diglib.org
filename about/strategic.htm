<h3><a id="aims" name="aims"></a>1. Aims</h3>

<p>The Digital Library Federation (DLF) is a consortium of
research libraries that are transforming themselves and their
institutional roles by exploiting network and digital
technologies. By working together they leverage their collective
reputations, investments, and research and development capacities
in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>share and evaluate information about digital library tools,
methods, practices, trends, and strategies;</li>

<li>stimulate and share in the conduct of necessary digital
library research and development;</li>

<li>respond quickly and effectively to digital library challenges
as they arise;</li>

<li>exercise some influence for the library community over a
rapidly changing information landscape;</li>

<li>act as a catalyst in the development of innovative
information services and organizations, and as an agent of
learning for the profession;</li>

<li>attract investment in essential digital library research and
development activities; and</li>

<li>build a community of professionals appropriate to the
development of digital libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Federation is a leadership organization operating under
the umbrella of the Council on Library and Information Resources
(<a href="http://www.clir.org">CLIR</a>). Its members manage and
operate digital libraries.</p>

<p>DLF require a common understanding of what a digital library
is. The DLF's initial working definition of a digital library is
as follows:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>"Digital libraries are organizations that provide the
resources, including the specialized staff, to select, structure,
offer intellectual access to, interpret, distribute, preserve the
integrity of, and ensure the persistence over time of collections
of digital works so that they are readily and economically
available for use by a defined community or set of
communities."</p>
</div>

<p>Of course, the concept of digital library has multiple senses
that one might invoke in various contexts. Accordingly, the
definition has been extended or at least qualified as follows
with reference to the functions that are increasingly becoming
associated with the digital library as it constructs online
environments through which it delivers its various services and
collections.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>The digital library extends the breadth and scale of scholarly
and cultural evidence and supports innovative research and
life-long learning. To do this, it mediates between diverse and
distributed information resources on the one hand and a changing
range of user communities on the other. In this capacity, it
establishes "a digital library service environment" - that is, a
networked, online information space in which users can discover,
locate, acquire access to and, increasingly, use information.
Although access paths will vary depending upon the resource in
question, the digital library service environment makes no
distinctions among information formats. Books, journals,
paper-based archives, video, film, and sound recordings are as
visible in the digital library service environment as are online
catalogs, finding aids, abstract and indexing services, e-journal
and e-print services, digitized collections, geographic
information systems, Internet resources, and other "electronic"
holdings.</p>

<p>In constructing a digital library service environment, the
library becomes responsible for configuring access to a world of
information of which it owns or manages only a part. Accordingly,
the digital library is known less for the extent and nature of
the collections it owns than for the networked information space
it defines through a range of online services. In the world of
commercial publishing, aggregators compete on the basis of the
value-added services that they layer on top of overlapping
electronic collections. Similarly, digital libraries establish
their distinctive identities, serve their user communities,
emphasize their owned collections, and promote their unique
institutional objectives by the way in which they disclose,
provide access to, and support the use of their increasingly
virtual collections.</p>

<p>The digital library service environment is not simply about
access to and use of information. It also supports the full range
of administrative, business and curatorial functions required by
the library to manage, administer, monitor engagement with, and
ensure fair use of its collections whether in digital or
non-digital formats, whether located locally or off site. The
digital library service environment integrates (and interfaces
with) information repositories that are characterized by
open-access shelving, high-density book stores and availability
via inter-library loan, and include data services and digital
archival repositories. It manages information about collections
and items within collections often throughout their entire life
cycle. It incorporates patron, lending, and other databases, and
integrates appropriate procedures for user registration,
authentication, authorization, and fee-transaction processing.
The digital library service environment may also evolve into a
networked learning space, providing access to and a curatorial
home for distance and life-long learning materials. The digital
library service environment is, in sum, an electronic information
space that supports very different views and very different uses
of the library. It is designed for the library's patrons as well
as for its professional staff and with an eye on the needs and
capacities of those who supply it with information content and
systems. It is built in the full knowledge that information
technologies will continue to change rapidly as will our
understanding of how they may be used effectively to support
education and cultural engagement. Finally it evolves as the
library's single most important core service and as such is
developed with a view to its financial and organizational
sustainability.</p>

<h3><a id="cpas" name="cpas"></a>2. Current program areas</h3>

<p>The DLF focuses its R&amp;D, information sharing, and
catalytic activities in areas of particularly pressing concern to
the digital library. At present, it is active in six areas but
its emphasis is expected to change to keep pace with the digital
library's evolving interests and needs. The current program areas
are introduced briefly below.</p>

<h4><a id="archs" name="archs"></a>2.1. Digital library
architectures, technologies, systems and tools</h4>

<p>Working within this area, members pool otherwise limited
research and development capacity to:</p>

<ul>
<li>define, clarify, and develop prototypes for digital library
systems and system components;</li>

<li>scan the larger technical environment for potentially
important trends and practices;</li>

<li>encourage technology transfer and information sharing between
and among DLF members and between the DLF and appropriate
commercial and industrial sectors; and</li>

<li>communicate technical directions and accomplishments of the
DLF to a wider audience.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="dcs" name="dcs"></a>2.2. Digital collections</h4>

<p>In the digital library collections are transformed through the
integration of new formats, licensed (as opposed to owned)
content, and third-party information over which the library has
little or no direct curatorial control. Collection development
strategies and practices are not yet fully developed to take
account of these changing circumstances nor are their legal,
organizational, and business implications fully understood. The
DLF accordingly seeks to:</p>

<ul>
<li>identify, evaluate and, where necessary, develop collection
strategies and practices that are appropriate for the digital
library and assess the legal, organizational, and business
implications of these strategies;</li>

<li>prepare guidelines and other informational materials that
help inform local collection development decision; and</li>

<li>encourage the development of new kinds of scholarly
collections that take full advantage of computer and network
technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="use" name="use"></a>2.3. Use, users, user support, and
user services</h4>

<p>In a digital library, how information is made, assembled into
collections, and presented online affects whether, to what
extent, and how it can be used. The DLF is committed to expanding
its program into this new and vitally important area and
considering initiatives which promise to help libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>engage more effectively with user communities as a means of
building better, more useful, and more useable collections and
services;</li>

<li>provide data about users and their behavior in online
environments as a means of informing the development of digital
library collections and services;</li>

<li>build sustainable user support services that encourage use
and are appropriate to our evolving digital library service
environments.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="pres" name="pres"></a>2.4. Digital preservation</h4>

<p>Building on the work of the Commission on Preservation and
Access (CPA), CLIR and the DLF remain committed to maintaining
long-term access to the digital intellectual and scholarly
record. They have a particular interest in:</p>

<ul>
<li>encouraging initiatives that result in some practical
experience of digital preservation;</li>

<li>developing and working within a framework that allows such
initiatives to document, compare, and evaluate their
experiences;</li>

<li>continuing research and development in the most poorly
understood areas associated with digital preservation including,
for example: 

<ul>
<li>strategies and practices appropriate for preserving digital
film, video, and audio and</li>

<li>estimating costs of digital preservation and assessing the
value of the digital record.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="stds" name="stds">2.5. Standards and
practices</a></h4>

<p>Here the DLF seeks to share information about the standards
and practices that are used to create, manage, and disseminate
those digital information resources with which digital libraries
typically come into contact. It will review these practices from
the digital library's unique perspective that naturally places an
emphasis, for example, on interoperability, long-term management,
and the use and re-purposing of digital content. Through its
review, the DLF will where possible identify, document, and
promote adoption of "good", "best", and "benchmark" practices
with a view to:</p>

<ul>
<li>encouraging greater interoperability and exchange of digital
collections;</li>

<li>facilitating long-term access to such collections; and</li>

<li>exercising some influence over the behavior of third-party
data suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="roles" name="roles"></a>2.6. Institutional roles and
responsibilities of the 21st century digital library</h4>

<p>With CLIR, the DLF shares an interest in helping libraries
promote themselves within their own institutions and to the
communities they serve. As libraries migrate collections and
services into a networked environment, that activity entails
developing a literature targeting specific communities that have
some stake in the library's future that inform those communities,
for example, about the distinctive educational and cultural value
of those collections and services and the real cost, legal
ramifications and organizational requirements of such collections
and services. Working within this program area CLIR and the DLF
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>undertaking a detailed survey that will provide important
baseline data about the organizational, financial, and legal
contexts in which digital libraries are beginning to emerge,
focusing in particular on libraries in higher education;</li>

<li>developing position papers targeting university presidents
and provosts of universities and liberal arts colleges,
documenting key digital library challenges and demonstrating
their relevance to university mission; and</li>

<li>identifying other key stakeholding communities that shape the
landscapes in which digital libraries develop, assessing their
interests and motivations, and preparing a targeted literature
for those communities that documents the digital library's
significance and its issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="org" name="org">3. Organization</a></h3>

<p>The DLF is a membership organization with two categories of
member: partners and allies. Partners contribute $20,000 annually
toward the DLF's operating costs and pledge $25,000 over five
years towards a capital fund. They have a seat on the DLF Board and the opportunity to shape and help develop the DLF's
program through a variety of R&amp;D, information sharing, and
catalytic initiatives. They are also invited to send staff to the
bi-annual DLF Forum. Allies typically work in proximate areas and
a senior officer of each allied organization sits on the DLF
Board "with voice, but without vote."</p>

<p>Although a membership organization, the DLF is a program of
CLIR, and is subject ultimately to the governance of the CLIR
Board. As a "federation," DLF is a consortium intended to have a
limited central organization. At this stage, DLF has a structure
with essentially six components: the Office of the Director, an
Executive Committee, a Board of Trustees, advisory groups, DLF
initiatives, and the DLF Forum.</p>

<h4><a id="od" name="od"></a>3.1. Office of the Director</h4>

<p>The office consists of the Director, a small support staff and
the various support structures that CLIR provides. It is
responsible for setting the goals and direction of the
Federation, managing the program activities and finances of the
DLF, supporting information sharing amongst the DLF members,
communicating about the DLF and its activities to the broader
community, and establishing external alliances. The office
benefits substantially from work of CLIR/DLF Distinguished
Fellows - senior information professionals who, with support from
CLIR and the DLF, are encouraged to pursue research or lead
catalytic initiatives in areas of mutual interest.</p>

<h4><a id="ec" name="ec"></a>3.2. Executive committee</h4>

<p>The Executive Committee advises the Director on policy and
other strategic matters as they arise. It consists of a small
number of Directors of institutions participating in the DLF as
Strategic Partners and is convened virtually as need
dictates.</p>

<h4><a id="sc" name="sc"></a>3.3. Board of Trustees</h4>

<p>The DLF Board is the governing body of the DLF. It
meets up to three times a year and provides oversight for the DLF
program activity and initiatives. The Board consists
of the Directors of those institutions participating as Strategic
Partners. It also includes the President of CLIR and, ex officio,
the Director of the DLF. Representatives of allied institutions
participate in the Steering Committee with a voice but no
vote.</p>

<h4><a id="iags" name="iags"></a>3.4. Informal advisory
groups</h4>

<p>Informal advisory groups may be convened by the Director to
advise on initiatives or program areas. They will comprise
experts drawn from DLF and other institutions and help to
articulate and prioritize need for research, development, and
information sharing within those areas. They may also take a role
in initiating consulting on and reviewing the work conducted by
any DLF initiatives undertaken within those areas and
communicating their accomplishments to DLF members and a wider
audience.</p>

<h4><a id="dlis" name="dlis"></a>3.5. DLF initiatives</h4>

<p>DLF initiatives are the principle source of the organization's
shared investigative, information-sharing, and catalytic
activities. Typically, they comprise a small number of
professionals and experts who collaborate as a means of
addressing key challenges that each confronts within his or her
own institution.</p>

<h4><a id="forums" name="forums"></a>3.6. DLF Forums</h4>

<p>Forums are convened periodically and include a number of
professionals from each of the member institutions. They serve as
meeting places, market places, and congresses. As meeting places
they provide an opportunity for the Board, advisory
groups, and initiatives to conduct their business and to present
their work to the broader membership. As market places, they
provide an opportunity for member organizations to share
experiences and practices with one another and in this respect
support a broader level of information sharing between
professional staff. As congresses, Forums provide an opportunity
for the DLF to continually review and assess its programs and its
progress with input from the broader membership.</p>

<h3><a id="comm" name="comm">4. Communication</a></h3>

<p>Effective communications are vital to the DLF. They ensure
that its program and program priorities respond to members' needs
and interests. They form the bedrock upon which effective and
meaningful collaboration is built. They enable the DLF to inform
its members and the broader library community about the
strategies, technologies, organizational mechanisms and legal and
business issues that have a direct bearing on the development and
cost effective maintenance of high-quality digital library
services and collections. Communications are also essential to
the DLF as it seeks to communicate its work to the broader
library community and act as a catalyst in the development of new
information services and organizations, and as an agent of
learning for the profession.</p>

<p>At present, the DLF's communications infrastructure
includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a network of electronic mailing lists;</li>

<li>a quarterly newsletter which reports the progress of DLF
initiatives to the members and through which, members report to
one another on their own digital library developments;</li>

<li>online registries comprising information about (a) members'
web-accessible public domain, digitized collections and (b)
policies, strategies, working papers, standards and other
application guidelines, and technical documentation developed by
DLF members to inform or reflect upon their digital library
development activities;</li>

<li>bi-annual DLF Forums; and</li>

<li>publications that report on DLF initiatives and on the
proceedings of the DLF Forum.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="resource" name="resource"></a>5. Resources</h3>

<p>DLF funds derive primarily from members' subscriptions and
capital contributions. Funds are expended to maintain the Office
of the Director and the DLF Forum, to support the work of
informal advisory groups, and crucially, the DLF initiatives.
With regard to initiatives, funding may be allocated with a view
to attracting co-investment from institutions that participate in
them and from external funding agencies. Prospects for increasing
funds available to the DLF through external funding and through
increased membership are kept continuously under review by the
Office of the Director and the Board of Trustees.
