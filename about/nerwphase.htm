Digital Libraries Reach New Phase</h2>

 Not many years ago, you would find them off in some remote nook
of the campus library. Experimenters, many of whom had long
worked on automating library systems, would be huddled over their
computer equipment, working through the problems of getting a bit
of the library's collection itself online. How interesting it was
to peruse electronic images of books, photos, and whatnot. But
such experiments seemed unconnected to the library's central
work, such as acquisition, cataloging, and reference. 

<p>That was then.</p>

<p>Now, the librarians who once experimented with solitary
digital-access projects at the library's periphery are
increasingly building systems for managing online information at
its core. Increasing chunks of library budgets are spent on
digitizing collections, acquiring such computer-accessible
research materials as e-journals, and maintaining online public
access catalogs. Moreover, librarians are applying
electronic-information technologies to the management of their
holdings in all formats - books, manuscripts, and other
traditional materials as well as digital collections. And by
relating rather than separating traditional and electronic
resources, they are developing more efficient and economical
services for the library as a whole.</p>

<p>This was the message from the latest forum organized by the
Digital Library Federation (DLF), which operates under the
administrative umbrella of the Council on Library and Information
Resources (CLIR). The DLF's 26 member-institutions and some
allied organizations sent 113 representatives to San Francisco on
May 4 through 6 to catch up on the latest developments in this
fast-moving field through reports, workshops, and professional
interaction. This was the fourth forum since the DLF's creation
in 1995.</p>

<p>"I'm detecting a shift in emphasis to infrastructure rather
than experimentation," DLF Director Daniel Greenstein declared at
a mid-meeting plenary session. Reviewing a recent survey of DLF
members-major university research libraries plus the New York
Public Library and the Library of Congress-Greenstein reported
the existence now of "an enormous core investment" in digital
library activity. Such activity, he said, is "becoming pervasive"
within libraries, and is "drawing on resources beyond them" from
academic computing centers, information technology departments,
and university presses. In developing online collections and
services, Greenstein continued, the field's leaders no longer are
proceeding "project by project" but are focusing on building
systems to provide a "production capacity for all we may want to
do."</p>

<p>One manifestation of this "shift" is increased attention to
the preservation of information already digitized so that
scholars, teachers, and students can be assured of continuing
access long-term. To take but one example from the forum, two
sessions gave participants an opportunity to hear about and then
discuss a program, funded by the Mellon Foundation, in which
seven libraries are working simultaneously on different
approaches to the preservation of scholarly journals published
electronically.</p>

<p>Among troublesome questions identified by session leaders were
these. Assuming that libraries can permanently archive
e-journals, at what point and under what rules should publishers
turn over e-journal content to libraries? What conditions would
"trigger" the library's right to provide access in place of the
publisher? And how much access, with what functionality, for
whom? Also how much content would be preserved-advertisements and
lists of editors as well as articles? Who would audit or certify
the authenticity of electronic copies? And for all of this, "who
pays?" With such questions in mind, the participating projects
hope to come up with guidance for creating collaborative
agreements as well as technological infrastructures.</p>

<p>The growing maturity of digital library work showed also in
presentations from librarians who are now paying more attention
to whether users really need and can conveniently use collections
made electronically accessible. For example, reports came from
the California Digital Library on usability testing techniques,
from Cornell on a study of how students use a digital-image
database, and from the University of Washington on how "Web stats
and common sense" can be employed to meet expectations of users
"instead of forcing them to meet yours."</p>

<p>Participants discussed needs for "putting out more PR" about
libraries' online offerings, for helping patrons develop
electronic research strategies and search skills, for relating
digitized material more closely to instructional requirements,
and for developing "personalized library services." Costs of
meeting user needs also came under scrutiny. Participants
examined the pros and cons of creating consortia for the
acquisition of e-material, and considered reducing costly
duplication by creating registries to describe what already is
digitized.</p>

<p>Other sessions focused on requirements for metadata,
standardization, and better tools for the management of digital
resources. Fortunately, "best practices" have become multiple,
participants were told; institutions may now need help to choose
among acceptable options. The use of partnerships at this stage
of digital library development also was described. In addition to
the collaboration of presses and libraries in the previously
mentioned program for preserving electronic journals, IT
professionals are joining librarians at Cornell to preserve
collections of digital data assembled by researchers themselves.
Museums, libraries, and archives in Illinois and Connecticut are
collaboratively digitizing material for school curricula. And a
task force of librarians, archivists, and scholars is preparing
guidance on the preservation needs in the digital era of material
in traditional formats such as photos, audiotapes, and books.</p>

<p>Just how far digital developments have come may be indicated
even by the latter group's title - the "Task Force on the
Artifact in Library Collections"!</p>
