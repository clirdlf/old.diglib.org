<br />
<p class="MsoBodyText">DLF proposes to move digital library
development to a new phase, a phase characterized by increasing
contributions of content, a deeper context for sharing that
content and a more robust architecture for supporting digital
services through the creation of a Distributed Open Digital
Library (DODL).</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The Digital Library Federation has a
strategic mission to foster and leverage digital library activity
among its members and in consort with other allied organizations.
Since its inception, it has provided leadership for digital
library development, served as a catalyst in the creation of
innovative information services and organizations, and provided a
venue and context for learning within the profession.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">DLF&rsquo;s mission further recognizes that
the digital library extends the breadth and scale of scholarly
and cultural evidence and thus supports innovative research and
life-long learning. (A sampling of such research and learning is
presented in the final section of this document.) To accomplish
this mission, it mediates between diverse and distributed
information resources on the one hand and a changing range of
user communities on the other. In this capacity, it will provide
a multi-institutional framework in which individual research
libraries will create their own collections of digital objects
for scholarship and teaching but, working as the DLF, will
establish a complementary digital library service
environment&rdquo; &ndash; that is, a networked, online
information space in which users can discover, locate, acquire
access to and, increasingly, use information. (DLF Strategic Plan
2000)</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Early development of this &ldquo;online
information space&rdquo; by DLF members has focused on projects
and the development of production processes and systems in the
first phase of DLF&rsquo;s operations. A rich array of content
has been created during these developmental years, typically
focusing on the needs of a particular community and a particular
type of material. Through collaboration, specifications for
digital library components have been pursued and new tools
developed for broader use. Yet, the landscape of digital library
development in 2003 remains largely focused on
institution-specific methodologies and surface-level sharing of
digital assets.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id=
"_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class=
"MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
We have not yet created a digital library resource that truly
begins to reflect the scope, depth and functionality of a large
research library.</p>
<br />
<h1><span style='font-style:normal'>A Case for a Federated
Digital Library</span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Libraries are collaborative by nature.
Shared cataloging is a striking early example. This
interdependence has been extended through the linking of content
between and among libraries. OAI efforts have also prompted a
number of venues through which metadata can be shared and
harvested for new services. The creation of a Distributed Open
Digital Library (DODL) by DLF would further enhance sharing in
ways that move significantly deeper than the status quo in terms
of function, service, re-use of content, and library
interdependency.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The current information landscape is dotted
with rich content silos that can be visited but which resist
innovative distributed recombination and re-use. This thwarts the
integration of remotely held content into local library services,
courseware systems, and scholarly desktop data-analysis tools.
Fundamental needs of users of the distributed open digital
library will be better served by exploring a collaboratively
built, federated digital library to which all participants
contribute content and from which libraries can draw files into
local collections for innovative use as the needs of local users
dictate.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Such a federated digital library may provide
a common interface. Within the parameters of content rights, it
would enable librarians and end-users alike to download
&ldquo;digital use copies&rdquo; files as malleable objects for
local re-combinations, to be enriched with context, crafted for
specific audiences, and unified in appearance and function.</p>
<br />
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The goals of the Distributed Open Digital
Library (DODL) include:</p>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">To create a framework for shared digital
library content, tools, and services among the DLF membership and
broader community</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">To catalyze collaboration among digital
library stakeholders in the development of rich content and
innovative services</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">To develop an extensible architecture to
leverage existing digital library assets, enable the development
of layered services, and explore models for managing digital
content rights in a collaborative environment</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">To generate, facilitate and evaluate use of
digital library content and services among our users</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">To engage potential funding agencies in
this effort</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="MsoFooter">In short, the DODL is intended to enable
better, as well as broader, use of digital assets.</p>
<br />
<h3>Populating the Distributed Open Digital Library</h3>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The vision and purpose of the DLF since its
founding has been to enable a large scale federated digital
library that advances the ongoing collaborative efforts of
research libraries to deliver the rich mosaic of their
complementary holdings to scholars. Much has been accomplished by
DLF members, both separately and collectively, in recent years.
DLF work has included conversion of large content collections and
development of standards, best practices, and the Open Archives
Initiative, an important foundation in federating access to
digital library content.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The DODL initiative takes the next major
step forward in pursuit of the DLF vision. At its core is design
and development to enable true sharing and use of digital library
resources.  It is also a vehicle for increasing the amount and
value of DLF content contribution in a sustainable manner. When
DLF members can truly share digital resources, contribution of
digital content conveys the benefits of cooperative collection
development:  each library&rsquo;s contribution is repaid by
complete access to the larger collection.  If the value of the
collection is sufficiently attractive, digital contribution
becomes a means of acquisition, potentially sustained with
library operating funds.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The model of coordinated collection
development has always worked best when it naturally builds on
institutional collecting policies and needs.  While
&ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; cooperative collection development is
unrealistic&mdash;since libraries are locally funded for their
own institutional objectives&mdash;various forms of value-added
coordination and project activity have created a national mosaic
of research collections that is far richer than insulated
individual collecting could engender.  We can now take this
effort further in the digital library arena, creating a
distributed open digital collection that in total is greater than
the sum of its contributed parts. Collaborations within DLF, even
as small as dyads and triads, can bring the same kind of
value-added to DODL collection expansion. Each library serves the
collective good by meeting local needs with either its own
efforts or by limited collaborations, with the DODL technical and
organizational framework providing guidance, but not controlling
process.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">There is already a rich array of digital
content available from DLF libraries, but it is disjoined and
episodic and often functions more as an exhibit for viewing than
as a library for interrogating.  In a recent study of ARL and DLF
digital collections, M. Dalbello finds that these collections are
much like museum exhibits, albeit somewhat rudimentary in terms
of contextual presentation (<i>Library Quarterly</i>,
forthcoming).  She concludes that the current efforts can best be
described by analogy to the development of museums and the early
<i>cabinets of curiosities</i>. While her study admires the
efforts of libraries to expand their role in presenting content
to the public, as research librarians we must also be concerned
that we are creating is the true analog of the research
library&mdash;i.e., a digital library that makes rich research
collections available for use.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Thus, the goal of the DODL is not to create
another self-standing thematic presentation, but to bring a large
amount of compelling and useful content into its realm &ndash;
both on a short-term project basis and by encouraging a long-term
pattern of collection contribution.  The DODL Initiative
Committee recommends to the DLF Executive Committee that it issue
a call to DLF members to contribute content in accordance with
the following recommendations:</p>
<br />
<ol style='margin-top:0mm' start="1" type="1">
<li class="MsoNormal">DODL resources must be shareable in the
DODL environment through appropriate technical standards to be
defined by a Technical Subcommittee.  The objective for such
standards is to be able to use DODL objects in the service layers
described in the following section. With an emphasis on the user
experience, the standards need to strike a balance between
compatibility for ease of use and practicality to enable both
near term adoption and the incorporation of existing corpora of
material.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">DODL resources must be shareable through
workable arrangements for access rights. Although it would be
ideal, it is neither necessary nor realistic to require that all
content in the DODL be essentially in the public domain or
cleared for general public access. Part of the development of the
DODL technical infrastructure requires means to authorize
categories of users. This could include requiring a user to
self-authorize by a &ldquo;click through&rdquo; agreement that
use is for scholarly purposes, but will also require the ability
to authorize categories of users by institutional affiliation,
e.g., DLF member institutions or members of a particular
scholarly association.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">DODL content must be of value to, at
minimum, a large body of scholars and thus be material to which a
majority of DLF members would desire access.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">DODL content should be in all formats
&ndash; print, image, multi-media, numeric, etc. &ndash;
appropriate to scholarly inquiry.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The DODL initiative seeks content
contributions from its members that match one or more of the
following categories:</p>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">Restructuring of appropriate existing
digital collections to meet Criterion 1 (above). We want to take
advantage of investments already made.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Collections developed in collaboration with
a national or international community of scholars.  Such
collections may be highly focused to meet a recognized research
need, such as the content of the Advanced Papyrological
Information System (APIS).  However, a much broader scope is also
appropriate, such as the materials and projects registered under
the umbrella of ECAI, the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative, a
community of scholars using digital technology to present data
through imagery and global mapping. Our objective would be to
make DODL a meaningful resource for the partner community.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Collections developed collaboratively by
two or more DLF members.  These projects should demonstrate the
value of resource sharing in the digital realm by assembling a
body of materials enriched by their integration.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A Layered Service Model for
Implementing the Distributed Open Digital Library</span></h2>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">In the past few years, we have heard a great
deal about a new &ldquo;layered&rdquo; service model.<a href=
"#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"><span class=
"MsoFootnoteReference"><span class=
"MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]</span></span></span></a>
This model would have libraries building highly customized local
services on the base of content and services managed by third
parties. The service model promises the same degree of
flexibility, innovation, and customization that is associated
with local service provision without sacrificing the economies
that are achieved through the shared centralized model. It also
promises to strengthen the library&rsquo;s historic and essential
mediating role between users and the information they seek. As
such, it seems a natural fit with the aims of the DODL.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Figure 1 represents schematically how the
DODL&rsquo;s integration into the layered service model may be
conceived. The figure depicts four digital object repositories.
These are simply digital collections. The collections could
comprise encoded texts (e.g. from the text centers at Virginia,
Michigan, Stanford, and elsewhere), digital images (e.g. at
Cornell, Yale, Minnesota, New York Public Library), research
publications (e.g. in pre-print servers or institutional
repositories at Cornell and MIT, respectively), sound recordings
(Indiana), archival finding aids (Chicago), maps (Texas), and
data collections (e.g. at Emory). And the collections could be
managed by commercial or society publishers, by universities,
research institutions, or by companies working in the
entertainment industry, as well as by libraries.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Users can browse, search, and display the
content of each of these repositories by visiting its website.
Users can also build &ldquo;higher-level services&rdquo; based on
the digital objects (the encoded, texts, faculty publications,
digital images, sound recordings, etc) that the repositories
contain. Higher-level services can use some or all of the digital
objects within one or more of the repositories. Thus, a higher
level service supporting study of the &ldquo;American West&rdquo;
may refer to some objects in several underlying repositories
(digital images of the West from an image repository,
publications about the West from a pre-print server, encoded
texts of works of western authors from the text repository)</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal" style='page-break-after:avoid'>
<img width=
"578" height="446" src="image001.jpg" alt="chart"/></p>
<p class="MsoCaption">Figure 1</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Figure 1 also depicts several types of the
higher level services that might be built directly on top of the
repositories. For example:</p>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">A subject portal &ndash; allows users to
search seamlessly across selected objects in underlying
repositories; that is, to view as a single database the
distributed publications, research datasets, and digital images
that reside in the underlying repositories.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">An archives portal integrates access to
online finding aids developed and maintained by hundreds of
libraries, archives, and special collections and will be referred
to again later.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">An alerting service notifies individual end
users about additions to (and deletions from) repositories.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">A print on demand and PDA delivery services
reformat document like objects from underlying repositories and
deliver them to a user&rsquo;s palm top or to a local print on
demand service that creates a perfect bound low-cost paperback
edition.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Additional service scenarios are included in
the final section of this document.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Some higher-level services are built on top
of services that mediate or shape their interaction with
underlying repositories. For example, authentication and
commercial transaction services might intervene between the print
on demand and PDA delivery service and the repositories that it
is built upon. This would ensure, for example, that only
fee-paying customers were able to print or deliver to their
PDA&rsquo;s the electronic editions of books and articles found
in the underlying repositories. The figure also shows some other
services that require three or more service strata.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The layered service model has enormous
potential for libraries.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The DLF&rsquo;s DODL initiative will
leverage the wealth and breadth of its members&rsquo; digital
collections and their technical capacity to practically evaluate
the layered service model, to address the numerous implementation
questions that surround its development and exploitation, and to
assess the model&rsquo;s potential costs to and benefits for
academic libraries.</p>
<br />
<h2><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Planning the Distributed Open
Digital Library: Next Steps</span></h2>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">A DODL Initiative Committee has thus far
explored the goals and scope of the proposed program. Further, it
has articulated the framework (described above) for moving beyond
existing surface-level and descriptive methodologies for sharing
content. . This is necessarily an incremental approach; the
intention is to achieve what is possible in the near term on a
limited scale and build from there. Following are near-term
steps:</p>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">The DLF Executive Committee will appoint a
Technology Subcommittee to specify the necessary components of an
extensible, layered architectural model, identifying what
components exist and where development is necessary. The design
will be peer reviewed. There will be a call for nominees and
volunteers for this subcommittee. Outside participants will be
considered as a means of opening the process.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">DLF will commission a review of existing
Open Archives Initiative content and services by an external
consultant to inform the Technology Subcommittee&rsquo;s
deliberations. This review will identify areas of successful
federation and promising developments.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">The DODL Initiative Committee will put out
calls for member participation through content, services, or
other development. This solicitation, which will be informed by
the specifications of the DODL Technology Subcommittee, will call
for:</li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="circle">
<li class="MsoNormal">Digital content (already in digital form or
to be converted)</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Development, adaptation, and/or integration
of services as identified by the Technology Subcommittee</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Individuals or groups that would test
designs, services, and instances of federated collections
accessible by the services</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Institutions willing and ready to work in
groups of two or more institutions on content, services,
integration, and/or tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">The DODL Initiative Committee will develop
principles for coordinating and managing the DODL development
process and identify necessary operational support for this early
phase. These principles will form the basis for future discussion
of a governance model for the DODL and will be circulated for
review and comment.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">The DLF Executive Committee will, as needs
are identified, designate or hire additional project support to
further the program development.  A permanent steering committee
will be created as the project transitions from the development
stage.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">DLF will make appropriate efforts toward
fund-raising for DODL efforts.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">The DODL Initiative Committee and DLF
members will pursue outreach to related efforts and programs
toward greater critical mass and breadth of materials and wider
adoption of the DODL as a means for building and sharing
collections.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Some Use Scenarios for the Distributed Open Digital
Library</h3>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The DODL will be user-focused to provide
rich and meaningful access to shared digital library content. Yet
DODL will also be library-focused to achieve new efficiencies in
digital library production, collection building, and services. 
The following scenarios illustrate some of the ways the DODL can
serve both local and collective purposes. Examples of layered
services, mechanisms for re-purposing content, and obstacles in
the current environment are highlighted in these scenarios.</p>
<br />
<h2>Scenario 1</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Imagine you are teaching the Civil War, or
you are a librarian crafting a collection in support of a seminar
on that subject. You quickly discover via the Internet many
books, images, letters, and manuscripts scattered across dozens
of institutions. At present, all you can do is to scrutinize that
data where it resides, in formats that the creator of the content
determined. You can make a list of resources&mdash;a web
bibliography&mdash;or write a description with hypertext links to
the scattered collections, and your students can visit these
other collections, akin to making museum fieldtrips. But that is
all&mdash;a passive engagement with content rather than an active
one. You cannot combine those scattered objects into something
new, improved, and shaped for your local needs.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Twenty books in twenty different locations
cannot easily be searched together, or enriched with information
and design elements of value for a local project, or dropped into
desktop software that may allow annotation by the user, or
subjected to linguistic or statistical analysis that the original
website does not support, or delivered in a format (Palm Pilot,
E-book) that the producer did not think useful, or used in myriad
other ways.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Libraries create high-quality digital
masters for long-term preservation and re-use, but then typically
expose only one view of a file to the user, in one particular
search-and-display software package. Rather than offering a
single view of a digital object that serves one type of need,
while under-serving others, DODL may allow teachers, librarians,
and other users options for re-shaping and combining content.</p>
<br />
<h2>Scenario 2</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Professor Sorenson prepares for a web-based
discussion with students and scholars related to the Arthurian
mythology.  A broad-based search, using Z39.50, OAI-based,
full-text, and multimedia-based techniques, across a federation
of repositories results in thousands of potential resources. 
Using visualization and filtering tools, Professor Sorenson
chooses a subset and a taxonomy for organization and
categorization of the digital content. </p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">The web-based cohort interacts in real-time,
proposes alternate organization models, and creates individual,
customized e-portfolios, sometimes accessing materials that
Professor Sorenson had considered "secondary" in importance.  One
student creates a blog that focuses on unexamined connections
between T.H. White&rsquo;s <i>The Once and Future King</i>, a
song from the musical <i>Camelot</i>, the movie <i>Excalibur</i>,
and John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s presidency. In many cases, objects
are re-purposed and manipulated into new learning objects for
subsequent use.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of these new objects are deposited into
an institutional repository as a bitstream. Professor
Sorenson&rsquo;s institution has defined the policies and
processes for such deposit, ensuring that the content will be
preserved and be seamlessly ported into electronic courseware,
e-publishing, and digital library systems for subsequent, and
sometimes unanticipated, use through various interfaces and
devices. DODL creates the opportunity for Sorenson and students
to use resources elsewhere and to make their work product
discoverable and available to others.</p>
<br />
<h2>Scenario 3</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">There is considerable interest in recreation
of medieval performance, including not only music and drama, but
also narration. Although we have manuscript documentation of such
medieval creative work, the core expression was, by definition,
the performance. Scholars around the world are working on such
recreations, and can now (at least in theory) share them
digitally so that they can be studied. A collection of digital
performance pieces could be used in segments, recombined,
analyzed, compared, and commented upon, in the same manner that
scholars share text that they are working on. Typically such
content is now presented in individual, contextual Websites, not
offered up as a &ldquo;database&rdquo; for use.  Incorporating
such objects into the DODL, however, could make them widely
available for much deeper use.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Scenario 4</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Imagine a musicologist investigating the
simultaneous use of jazz idioms and stylistic elements by French
classical musicians of the first half of the 20th century and the
use by American jazz musicians of French musical elements in the
same period.  In addition to the core musical elements such as
harmonic structures, use of specific chords, rhythmic patterns,
formal structures, distinctive decorative elements, modal
melodies, and more or less clear quotation, there are social,
economic, and perhaps even political questions.  Among the
sub-topics arising in this research are those of racial
boundaries, exoticism as an element of popular taste, the
transmission of stylistic elements among musical communities, and
compositional practice and intentions. Ellington, Ravel, and
Stravinsky will figure prominently in this inquiry.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">In order to pursue this line of research on
the core musical question, the scholar will need to go much
further than the well known works from the repertories.  She will
have to convert exemplars of the styles to transposable, numeric
&ldquo;signatures&rdquo; in digital form.  Then, she will compare
her signature elements to thousands of digital excerpts taken
from many collections. Automatic searches with the specifications
of composers, performers, groups, styles, critics, performing
locations, and titles of works will help her search the contents
of digitized newspapers of the period, as well as magazines,
histories of music, memoirs and collections of letters, and
archival documents of the key composers and musicians. DODL makes
the discovery and use of these various resources practical.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoFooter">Scenario 5</p>
<p class="HTMLBody"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>DODL can have a
role in the production and distribution of scholarly monographs
that responds to the following three-headed conundrum:</span></p>
<br />
<p class="HTMLBody" style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1) Monographs
continue to play an important role in the recruitment, retention,
and reward of scholars working in several disciplines.</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody" style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2) Library
demand for monographs is declining. A publisher that 15 years ago
could count on US libraries buying 1,500 copies of a new
monograph, might sell only 200 or 300 copies of a new monograph
that is published today.</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody" style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3) Scholarly
publishers have responded to diminishing demand for monographs by
drastically curtailing the number of new titles that they publish
annually. The impact is particularly hard-felt on scholars in
disciplines where monograph publication is a pre-requisite for
tenured (even tenure-track) jobs. The cycle, if unbroken, becomes
a vicious one, yet libraries, publishers, and faculty, alike
hesitate to break it.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="HTMLBody"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To deal with
this challenge, DODL might work with presses to explore new
models of monograph production and distribution models that
enable libraries to reduce their dependence on redundant print
acquisitions without undermining publisher revenues, the
monograph publication process that is so critical to academic
advancement, or patron&rsquo;s access to monographic materials.
One such model sees publishers making monographs available
digitally as open repositories (not free, necessarily, but open)
and printing only a limited number of hard and paperback editions
on demand. DODL could be the locus and pioneer effort for such
repositories.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="HTMLBody"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The terms of
digital distribution would need to be agreed with the publishers
individually but should be designed to help the publisher recoup
revenues loss from substantially reduced hard copy library sales.
Various distribution scenarios could be offered as a fee-based
service with a portion of the fee transmitted as a royalty to the
publisher. Thus, the user might select from a progressively
priced set of choices (somewhat like ebrary): read online,
download some or all to a handheld device, print low-quality but
perfect bound paperback copy locally, purchase hardcopy print
edition from publisher or bookseller.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="HTMLBody"><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The model is
essentially layered.  Such a model, which DODL could support, may
offer hope to:</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody" style=
'margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>&middot;<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>       </span></span> <span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That part of the
scholarly community that relies professionally on the
monograph&rsquo;s continued existence (university presses could
grow monograph lists without requiring equal or greater growth in
hard-copy sales);</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody" style=
'margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>&middot;<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>       </span></span> <span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Libraries (that
need to provide access to comprehensive collections but cannot do
so by locally to acquiring, owning, and managing all of the print
and digital items in them); and</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody" style=
'margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span style=

presses and scholarly societies whose operations, though vital to
scholarly communications, are not easily sustained by the current
model of monograph production and distribution.</span></p>

The greatest push is coming from so-called web services. See Clay
Shirky, Planning for Web Services: Obstacles and Opportunities
(April 2002) from <a href=
"http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/04/12/execreport.html">http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/04/12/execreport.html</a> 
but the layered service model is not at all unknown amongst
digital libraries. See Andy Powell, Liz Lyon, &ldquo;The DNER
Technical Architecture: scoping the information
environment&rdquo; (May 2001), from <a href=
"http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/jisc-ie/arch/dner-arch.html">
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/jisc-ie/arch/dner-arch.html</a>.
It is also very apparent in work on instructional technologies.
