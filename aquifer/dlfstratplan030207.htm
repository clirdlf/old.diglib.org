<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Purpose
and Background Papers</span></i></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><br />
Mr. Keller expressed the hope that participants could emerge from
the meeting with consensus on a sense of direction for the DLF
for the next five years. At his request, participants spent a few
moments reading two reports, placed in packets for the meeting in
addition to material participants had been asked to read in
advance. The reports were the executive summary from
"Revolutionizing Science and Engineering Through
Cyberinfrastructure," a report by an advisory panel of the
National Science Foundation
&lt;<u>http://www.communitytechnology.org/nsf_ci_report/ExecSum.pdf</u>&gt;,
and a Web page about the "Digital Promise," a project to create a
Digital Opportunity Investment Trust
&lt;<u>http://www.digitalpromise.org/aboutdp.asp</u>&gt;. Mr.
Keller than called attention to a DLF paper, circulated in
advance of the meeting, entitled "Research libraries and the
services they offer in 2013, a scenario for discussion." Mr.
Keller asked if anyone proposed changes in this
scenario.</span></p>
<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'>Scenario Discussion</span></i></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Several
participants individually expressed discomfort with the scenario
on the following grounds. The scenario seemed too closely
extrapolated from current standard library functions rather than
considering possible new roles for libraries in education and
publication. The scenario assumed continuity in the legal and
policy frameworks of libraries, and treated them as containers of
information rather than as supporters of scholarship and
learning. It was unmoving and spoke insufficiently about the real
business of higher-education institutions, which is to meet needs
in education and research. It did not acknowledge new kinds of
partnerships that libraries could forge with scholars and others
in the future, and it did not deal with the staffing component of
libraries.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Noting the
unpredictability of changes in how data will be used, Mr. Keller
said that the development of massive content as envisioned in the
scenario would support new functions and meet real needs. Several
participants nonetheless called for a different emphasis in the
scenario, and expressed the following views. Planners should
first determine how digital libraries could create value for
research and learning in a changing environment, then work back
to what to do. The scenario did not speak to dynamic learning
possibilities, to what libraries would do with massive digital
content, or to what roles various players would have. To make the
content useful would require a superstructure. Planners should
not jump to conclusions that libraries will have future roles,
but instead should identify what work will need to be done and
who best can do it. The DLF should look at points of intersection
and tension to determine where it can make a
difference.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
discussion then turned to changes in higher education and in
library roles, dwelling on the following points. Differences
among institutions and among fields are expanding (for example,
between natural scientists and art historians), reducing points
of continuity. A lot of what is now available for scholarship and
learning is not in the library, and a digitized humanities
environment may not need the library at all. However, libraries
may be needed to help users negotiate masses of digitized
information, and libraries will want to be the trusted
repositories for data. There is a need for people who understand
how information is created and know how to package and deliver it
for use -- people who can help users get and use data; digital
libraries can be information brokers. One participant countered
that the concern should not be how to position the library for
the future, but how to help educational institutions maximize the
benefits of technological development; and another predicted that
useful functions and roles would emerge as change
unfolded.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The agenda
then called for the group as a whole to break out into three
smaller groups, charged by Mr. Keller to test assumptions in the
scenario and report proposals for changing it.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>First
Break-out Group Reports</span></i></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#1</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms. Dewey
reported for Group #1, chaired by Ms. Eaton (pending the arrival
of Mr. Walker), and containing also Mr. Hickerson, Mr. Leonard,
Ms. Mandel, Ms. Marcum, Mr. McFarland, Mr. Tabb, and Ms.
Thorin. </span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #1
proposed the following, revised scenario</span></b><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'>. The DLF would continue to take advantage of
its ability to be nimble, assemble smart people, move quickly,
and get things done. It would adopt three priorities:</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1) creation
of digital material</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2)
interlinking</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3)
preservation</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Members are
already close to content sharing and would move to the creation
of a Digital Library Federation collection. To achieve this,
digitization budgets would be enlarged to support the emergence
of a virtual collection for DLF user communities and others. DLF
members would help institutions that do not have large enough
budgets to develop such resources.  In response, individual
participants said that -- simultaneous with developing content --
collaborative work would be needed to provide services and
analyze user needs. Also, attention should be given to scholars
doing new things. Work toward a DLF collection could start with a
focusing project.    </span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#2</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms. Sandore
reported for Group #2, chaired by Ms. Nutter, and containing also
Ms. Cline, Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Gosling, Mr. Lynch, Ms. Prochaska,
Ms. St. Clair, Ms. Trainer, and Ms. Wilson.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #2
proposed that missing elements be worked into the original
scenario, which focused on content rather than people, noting
that information resources are for use.</span></b> <span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'>Libraries can co-evolve with faculty and other
content creators. Collectively, the DLF would plan not for a
fixed point ten years out but for an organic process of
transformation, in which libraries would integrate collections,
interoperate, build services to help users find information, and
work with other creators on curation and navigation. Libraries
should translate across disciplines and datasets; they have an
important bridge role on which to capitalize. They can add value
to information, help different disciplines to communicate, and be
trusted repositories for archiving. Describing these as
"preferred directions," Group #2 did not propose to throw out the
original scenario but to put the library into it in a revised
manner.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#3</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms.
O'Leary-Archer reported for Group #3, chaired by Ms. Wittenborg,
and containing also Ms. Gotwals, Mr. Lucier, Ms. Lougee, Mr.
Michalko, Mr. Mosher, Mr. Neal, Mr. Runkle, and Mr.
Thibodeau.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #3
proposed the objective of improving the efficiency of the
scholarly enterprise. This would include balancing the interests
of knowledge creators and consumers in an access management
system.</span></b> <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Libraries would
have a role in this and would need to collaborate to carry it
out. There are tensions in the interactions of technology,
information organizations, and preservation needs, and there are
economic issues that cannot be ignored. Libraries would be not
just content builders but enablers of knowledge creation and
sources of balance among the tensions. The DLF and its member
libraries would break down barriers and promote communication
through all phases of the continuum from knowledge creation
through knowledge consumption.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>All groups
having reported, the agenda then called for the break-out groups
to return to their individual deliberations, charged by Mr.
Keller with identifying methods, opportunities, hurdles, and
intermediate goals pertinent to their respective
scenarios.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Second
Break-Out Group Reports</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'> </span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#1</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. McFarland
reported for Group #1, chaired by Mr. Walker.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>To develop
a DLF collection, Group #1 said it would be necessary to recruit
helpful scholars, identify collections to digitize, and get input
from users.</span></b> <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>DLF
constituent institutions would be able to download content into
local systems, for cross-searching, annotation, etc. They would
leverage what they already have, ask scholars what they want, get
communities of scholars to partner in the endeavor, and enable
end users to manipulate content, providing tools for doing so
instead of just reformatting content.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Concerning
barriers, collaborative collection sharing would be useful to a
broad population, but some librarians are uncomfortable about
sharing digital masters. Group #1 reported disagreement about
what level of sharing libraries would provide for a DLF
collection. Libraries know how to build content that can "behave"
differently, content that can look different in different
projects; but libraries may not be able to give access to content
for anyone to use in any way.</span></p>
<br />
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#2</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms. Wilson
reported for Group #2, chaired by Ms. Nutter.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #2
advocated setting scenarios aside in favor of preferred
directions.</span></b> <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The group
recommended an organic, iterative approach in which libraries
would undergo co-evolution with their universities within overall
transformations. Libraries would focus on creating value for
users, overseeing and facilitating the continuum from knowledge
creation to consumption. Libraries themselves would have no
divine right to any role, but would be part of a framework of
trusted partnerships and collaborations, interdependent with
communities of learning.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Barriers
include all kinds of silos and fences. They are a big problem
because service expectations have skyrocketed. Users give highest
value to digital access. Included are unforeseen and
transformational users who make use of materials beyond what was
expected or intended. In Group #2's view, the DLF would be
involved in all elements of the digital world&mdash;collections,
services, architectures, uses. The DLF would engage in developing
standards, best practices, and a shared architectural view. Group
#2 described its "picture" as "Collide-a-scope."</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#3</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms.
O'Leary-Archer reported for Group #3, chaired by Ms.
Wittenborg.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #3
recommended three areas for DLF involvement:</span></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1) The DLF
would develop a framework for collaborative digital content
development; that is, a framework to enable and facilitate
collaboration among partners, both to create digital content and
to convert traditional resources to digital. </span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2) The DLF
would engage in research and development activities, such as
modeling, testing, and problem solving, concentrating on enabling
infrastructure and applied developments.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3) The DLF
would build, support, and nurture alliances and partnerships to
advance digital library developments. The DLF would have to
overcome economic, technological, and legal barriers; surmount
stakeholder differences; and develop staff expertise and business
rules.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>At the end of
these reports, the meeting was adjourned until the next morning,
Friday 7 February 2003, at 9 am, with Mr. Keller in the
chair.</span></p>
<span style=
'font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><br clear="all"
style='page-break-before:always' /></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Second
Day: Recap and "Straw Man&rdquo; Proposal</span></i></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
began with the following recap of the previous day's session. The
DLF has accomplished many good projects devised by its members'
technical people, including establishing registries and advancing
the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). The DLF has been developing
architecture amidst change, and now may need a new, high-level
view with functional specifications. The DLF has worked
collaboratively and flexibly, forming small groups as needed. The
DLF has been action-oriented, responsive to library staffs and
the needs of institutions and patrons, and an agent for
transformation. The question now is how to leverage what the DLF
has done?</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The previous
day's reports, Mr. Keller continued, had provided some ideas. DLF
members are ready now to move to sharing resources and services,
federating to benefit scholars and learners. They are ready to
talk about collaboratively building a collection or some
collections, and engaging scholars in the process, recognizing
that tools and collections go together because the availability
of collections generates demands for new tools, and vice
versa.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
then asked Mr. Seaman to elucidate a "straw man" proposal derived
from the previous day's discussion. Mr. Seaman proposed that as a
first step the DLF collaboratively build new content as a test
bed, involving collections, services, and users. An individual
institution could commit to working with the test bed in any area
with which the institution was comfortable.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Each
institution contributing to the collections track, Mr. Seaman
explained, would provide 50 digitized items, using selection
criteria to be developed. These items would come from the
humanities, from American culture, or from whatever else made
sense locally. Each institution would contribute its titles to
the shared collection, and get back access to X times that
number, determined by the number of participating institutions.
Lots of collections already digitized could also go into this DLF
library, which would be a prototype for a collaborative body of
recombinant content. The content could be collections of images,
books, audio, or video.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Concerning
services and users for the test bed, Mr. Seaman said, an
institution that did not feel able to contribute content to the
collection could commit to help build context, could work with
their faculty on how to mine the content, or could actively
partner with users in developing services.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
added that institutions could create links from digital objects
in the collection to other literature and resources, and could
assess the value of services to users. On Day One there was some
resistance to federating what libraries already have digitized,
he observed, so DLF members would create this initial prototype
collection with material newly digitized.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Seaman
noted that for some purposes it may be enough to be able to get
access to digital content on another institution&rsquo;s site,
but that alone is not enough for some scholars, who want to
search material simultaneously from many sites, re-shape it for a
particular audience, software tool, or hardware device, or add
levels of encoding to it for a particular local project.  These
types of use are rarely possible now, and their expected high
value is an assumption that the prototype project could test. In
response to Ms. Lougee's observation that a design process would
be needed for so complex an undertaking, Mr. Seaman said that
members of the DLF with relevant expertise could be pulled
together for that purpose.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
posited a need to get the functions down, determine what the
collaborators would want to do with the content, and then
re-deploy the functions in an access structure. He also described
how the design could incorporate descriptive bibliographies as
scaffolds for linking items in the collection to pertinent
material elsewhere, with variable presentation options for
readers. There would be an extensible set of
possibilities.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Two
participants observed that users would have to be consulted on
they would want and used. And Mr. Lucier raised questions about
success factors. Trying to create a model for federated content
would be enormously complex, he said; earlier DLF work had been
done by small groups, and such a group would be useful for
"reality testing" of the proposed "straw man." Involving everyone
could be difficult, he said, because it is hard to uncouple
content and services, and might not be desirable; but an expert
small group could begin working out arrangements without the need
for all institutions to participate right away. The project could
develop in phases under Mr. Seaman's management.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Other
comments from the group in a lively discussion included the
following:</span></p>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Digitized
content must be available for whatever applications become

<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The DLF
would need to identify and break through difficulties that have

things as copyright complications.</span></li>

<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A great
volume of content would be necessary for the collection to be

<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>If libraries
digitized the primary sources in their collections, copyright
problems would be reduced, and the use of rare materials would be
increased. However, monographs are large parts of academic
libraries, and staying away from books might cut out large and
important user constituencies.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Libraries

<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A sound
business model is needed; lack of one has been a problem for
earlier collaborative efforts. The straw man needs appendages
dealing with issues of scalability and sustainability and also
with legal and policy issues, in which digital libraries have
expertise and influence.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Cost
recovery may not be necessary; the entrepreneurial world is not
where DLF libraries want to go. They own a lot of content and can
start with what they have.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Each library
could build the costs of its contribution to the collection into
its budget, but to do that would require justification in terms
of seeing this kind of shared collection building as integral to
the individual library's services. The collaborative project
could use a "barter economy" in which contributions constituted
"a circle of gifts."</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul style='margin-top:0mm' type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The project
could help increase understanding of the DLF and appreciation of
the incredible difference it is making. Weaving alliances would
be important, and strategic partnerships could have financial
benefits.</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Michalko
described efforts in which the RLG has been involved to federate
already digitized materials from some libraries. The need is to
make scattered collections into something with utility, he said.
The hard part is developing an applied policy model. People from
projects already going on would need to come together to figure
out where technological, business, and institutional policies
intersect. A monumental project is not necessarily needed.
Questions include whether to federate virtually or physically,
how to create effective user experiences, and how to reach
consensus on policies when libraries operate so differently,
using different page-turning mechanisms, for example.
Institutional imperatives, he continued, reduce the will to
collect collaboratively, making it hard to get resources diverted
in a common direction. And service manifestations need to be
different for different disciplines, which use material in
different ways. But subsets of people within the DLF could work
on such issues. In what areas could we break through local
imperatives to meet a collaborative need?</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The ensuing
discussion produced the following points. Current budget problems
for libraries -- not uncooperativeness -- inhibit collaboration;
but libraries cannot afford to build large digital collections on
their own, so they must engage each other in spite of the
difficulties and try something, hoping for support from scholars
who will say that the results are really good for them. The more
faculty members who say they want what libraries develop, the
more librarians can justify it in their budgets.  One approach
might be to deconstruct successful existing collections (Making
of America, etc) to see whether and how they might develop
differently today.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A common
collection sponsored by DLF would be an attractive alternative to
more and more titles coming in library doors. Proposals to help
build a DLF collection could be requested, and the collection
could draw on digitizing work that libraries are already doing.
Each library's collection could become everybody's. But a goal
should be to get this project embedded in normal library budgets,
not as an add-on.   </span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Seaman
explained that getting collaborative collection building into the
regular ongoing budgets of multiple institutions is one of two
ways in which the straw-man proposal would differ from previous
kinds of collection sharing. The other difference is that
material in the collaborative collection would be re-combinable
for users' own purposes rather than only usable on the terms
(functional and aesthetic) of the producers. Mr. Keller added
that the collaborative collection would need a simple publishing
environment allowing users to get texts they can reformat. But he
reiterated that not all DLF libraries would have to take part in
all elements of developing the collection.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
discussion continued with the following points. Selectivity in
content for the collection is not of great importance because
whatever is digitized in bulk gets used. Experience has shown
that how useful a digitized collection may turn out to be cannot
be predicted. High-Wire Press has found a pattern in which the
use of newly accessible digital material soars, then descends
through a series of plateaus, but remains greater than the use of
print versions of the same material. However, can libraries
ensure that digital material will be around forever?</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The agenda
then called for the resumption of deliberations in the break-out
groups, which Mr. Keller charged to consider the following
questions: What basic functions of libraries need to be accounted
for in planning a collaborative collection? What functional
features would be desirable in the beginning? What types and
genres of material would a prototype include? What will need to
be built that digital libraries do not already have? What
opportunities are there for new partnerships? What is best for
storage and access? What are the necessary commonalities? Groups
should assume, Mr. Keller said, that funding can be obtained for
the prototype.</span></p>

'font-size:12.0pt'>The committee would consist of Mr. Seaman, as
DLF director, and five directors of DLF-member libraries, only
one of whom was on the Executive Committee. The committee would
report back to the DLF Steering Committee in a short time. A
coherent theme or focus for the collaborative would be desirable,
something with a compelling vision to capture public attention.
One possibility, the group suggested, would be a Digital Library
for the Humanities. But the initiative should start with
something scaleable, some piece of the humanities that is
interdisciplinary.</span></p>

#2</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms. Wilson
reported for Group #2, which continued to be chaired by Ms.
Nutter.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #2
recommended that the DLF "leverage the interdependence of
federated collections," without the unsustainable overhead of a
"central bucket."</span></b> <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>DLF
institutions wishing to make their digital materials available
would do so in ways that would make possible recombinant uses of
material, in exhibits, lab notebooks, course projects,
courseware, and other forms of customization. Archiving,
registries, and other services would be developed. Development
would be phased and allow for different levels of engagement by
DLF institutions.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>"DLF
commitments" would be to adhere to minimum standards, develop
content as a "circle of gifts (COG)," and migrate content,
keeping responsibilities local and in alignment with individual
institutional incentives and missions.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group
#3</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Ms.
O'Leary-Archer reported for Group #3, chaired again by Ms.
Wittenborg.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Group #3
described two tracks that might be followed: (1) a federation of
existing content in DLF libraries, which would require design
work and money for migration; and (2) a transformational new
digital library.</span></b><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
latter would have several attributes. One attribute would be an
integrated effort that would be experienced as a whole and seem a
single enterprise from the user perspective; yet this digital
library would recognize the individual contributions of
institutions in the collaborative. This digital library would be
collaborative at a high level, allowing for ingestion, discovery,
archiving, and user tools, but in sustainable ways. It would use
open-source tools but be commerce-compatible. Financial and
governance models would be needed, particularly concerning how
non-DLF participants would give to and take from the digital
library. Group #3 proposed to consider two projects of this kind,
involving the sciences as well as the humanities, but focusing on
subjects needing interdisciplinary collections for
study.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'>Conclusions</span></i></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
summarized what he perceived to be the outcome of the
deliberations.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>1)  The DLF
needs an Initiative Committee to frame a collaborative digital
library project and produce a focused plan for its first phase.
Members of the committee would be Mr. Seaman and five DLF-member
university librarians, no more than one of whom would be serving
also on the Executive Committee.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>2) The
library to be constructed would have an "umbrella collection"
covering something compelling to the public and broad enough to
permit growth. It would be a multi-media collection. To create a
Digital Library for the Humanities might be too limiting; the
choice of collection should not limit the model. The collection
would embrace particular components under a generic, extensible
title that identifies goals; "JSTOR" provides an example. The
Initiative Committee would identify specifications for a
functional architecture, with help, if desired, from other
committees of specialists.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
said that a chart devised by Group #2 [Appendix 1] summarized
much of the meeting's discussion. It called for a distributed
rather than a central library. However, Mr. Keller said, a
determination of what the functionality would be should precede
decisions about the degree of federation; there could even be
variations such as a central collection with federated services.
 However it was arranged, there was common agreement that it had
to appear to be a unified body of material &ndash; a single
library -- to the user.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In response,
some participants expressed concern about the financial
sustainability of centralization and about the difficulties of
enforcing legal, ownership, and branding restrictions on
contributed content. They advocated leveraging their libraries'
interdependence, with recognition of sources of
contributions.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
concurred with Group #3's proposal to use both old and new
digital material in the collaborative project, but observed that
ingestion is a huge task and that shared (but not necessarily
"open source") tools would be needed.  </span><span style=
'font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller noted that the plan was for
federated collections, not a single one, qualifying the "umbrella
collection" idea (#2 above) to mean an umbrella sheltering many
collections in many different digital libraries across the DLF
membership.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>The
discussion included observations that DLF members should begin
the project, but then open it to participation by others. Global
access would be the ultimate goal, and the project might be used
to seed an international group.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Mr. Keller
continued his summary of the deliberations with the following
points.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(1) For this
initiative to be credible, a key shared assumption would be the
need for true, digital archives at the project's
foundation.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(2) Also
there will be various registries, freely accessible.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(3) The test
phase will need some kind of access-authorization
control.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(4) There
will be a common platform for user access, and common coding and
formats for various kinds of objects.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>(5) Tests
should be conducted on some groups as the project goes along to
see if users can use the content creatively, pulling material
into their own environments.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>A brief
discussion followed about the desirability -- impractical though
it would be at the outset -- of developing an enhancement to
allow scholars' creative uses of the collection to be brought
back into it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Next
Steps</span></i></b></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>As the next
step, Mr. Keller requested from each participant in the strategic
planning meeting a statement of what that person and her or his
institution would be willing to do in line with the plans
discussed.  Examples included contributing collections,
recruiting users, and/or serving on committees to work on
particular elements of the project. Mr. Keller asked to receive
these statements within a week. The Executive Committee and Mr.
Seaman will look at the responses in preparation for setting up
the Initiative Committee, which will be asked to report within
two to three months. Calling attention to the first paragraph of
the DLF's current charter
&lt;www.diglib.org/about/dlfcharter.htm&gt;, Mr. Keller concluded
that no charter modification would be needed to accommodate plans
as discussed at this meeting.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In terms of
publicity, Mr. Keller counseled that no press release or public
announcement be made until an appealing name for the project has
been found, potential funders have been approached, and assets
have been gathered and made ready for use. However, the project's
agenda could be advanced at the next DLF Forum.</span></p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>At
approximately 2 p.m., the meeting was adjourned.</span></p>
