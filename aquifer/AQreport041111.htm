<p><i>Digital
libraries add value to information by organizing it into coherent, highly
differentiated collections that are developed to support particular modes of
inquiry and/or user communities. Users access these collections with the
current generation of sophisticated search tools, but also through a range of
highly specialized end-user services.<sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></i></sup>.  <i>Google, by
contrast,  adds value to information by amassing it into vast, largely
undifferentiated collections which users examine with increasingly
sophisticated search tools.</i></p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>A. What is Aquifer</span></b></p>

<p>Supporting research, teaching, and learning with
high-quality online special collections and distinctive information services.
Aquifer is an initiative of the Digital Library Federation (DLF). It leverages
DLF members’ extant digital collections, their institutional capacities,
curatorial expertise, and historic service to scholarly communities. </p>


<p>Aquifer members are committed to interoperability, resource
sharing, and adherence to agreed standards and information architectures, as
well as to the participation in fulfilling shared development agenda. Membership
in Aquifer requires financial commitment of its members. It also requires
alignment of organizational goals and investments.</p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>B. Some Aquifer development directions</span></b></p>

<p><b>1. Collections. </b>Aquifer will build virtual online
collections of openly accessible materials that support innovation in research,
teaching, and learning. Initially, it will build a virtual collection
illuminating American history, society, culture, geography and the environment.
In this effort it will leverage two related multi-institutional initiatives: The
American South (based at Emory) and The American West (based at CDL) by:</p>

<ul>
<li>surfacing additional content that enriches, enhances, and extends them</li>

<li>fill significant gaps already identified in both the American West and American South collections, notably in American literature and American music (including audio, sheet music, and scores).</li>
</ul>


<p>Aquifer will look to the American South and American West
projects to define collection development paths and processes for collections
of cultural materials bearing on American history and society.  It will
commission collection development strategies for American literature and
American Music.</p>


<p><b>2. Standards. </b>Aquifer will adopt a range of standards
that enable and encourage interoperability and co-development. <b> </b>It has
already adopted standards for data providers. The standards are considered to
be 1) in development and 2) an initial layer of the standards that will
ultimately endorsed and required.</p>

<p>Adopted standards include those recommended for data
providers by the DLF OAI best practices working group. In addition, the group
agreed that data providers should:</p>

<ul>

<li>provide data for harvesting according to a range of preferences
to be listed in descending order of preference from MODS, to MARC-XML, etc</li>

<li>commit to implementing sets and set descriptions</li>

<li>adopt and encourage the use of RLG guides to good practice as
pertaining to metadata creation</li>

<li>submit metadata for data validation and analysis by a trusted
third party</li>

<li>encourage community specific metadata practices appropriate for
the development of specific virtual collections (thus, contributors to the
American West collection have agreed to a specific implementation of data and
coverage elements to support development of virtual collections organized
minimally by chronological period and by region)</li>

</ul>

<p>Although Aquifer emphasizes standards for its data
providers, it recognizes the limitations on this means of collection building.
Accordingly, it adopts two other collection development strategies:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>development and use of data mining tools to overcome
     deficiencies in sub-standard collections</li>
 <li>development of services that enable iterative and
     incremental metadata enrichment </li>
</ul>

<p><b>3. Technology</b>. Aquifer will focus initially on the
development of tools and practices that enable implementation of OAI harvesting
best practices in the development of virtual online collections. As a starting
point Aquifer will </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>review and describe approaches to metadata capture,
     analysis, normalization, transformation/enrichment that are currently being
     used by Aquifer members (e.g. in the American South, American West, Michigan, Illinois, and other projects), and by selected other projects with comparable
     aims (e.g. NSDL, OCLC, etc);</li>
 <li>document and where possible review tools that are
     currently being used by those initiatives, focusing on their strengths,
     weaknesses, future development paths and potential, as well as on their
     possible generalizability/re-usability; </li>
 <li>gather information about tools being developed and/or used
     for these purposes, adding that information to the tools registry, and in
     so doing helping to develop and refine our understanding of how the
     registry might be used and how information recorded by it might be
     organized</li>
</ul>

<p>The process will result in the identification and further
development (co-development where appropriate) of essential tools that aid
Aquifer in developing virtual collections.</p>

<p><b>4. Basic infrastructure</b>. Aquifer will develop and
maintain basic infrastructure to supports resource sharing and co-development
and including</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>basic communications infrastructure including a Website, a
     Wiki, and a listserv</li>
 <li>a registry of open-source tools being developed and/or
     used by partners in the development of well-curated virtual collections</li>
 <li>a registry of user needs assessment information that will
     help inform Aquifer collection and service development efforts</li>
 <li>a registry of collections on offer to Aquifer and meeting
     Aquifer’s minimum benchmark standards (e.g. required to enable
     interoperability etc)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>5. Organizational infrastructure</b>. Aquifer will employ
a Director. It may seek to employ a number of program managers concentrating in
key areas (architecture and technology, collections, etc).</p>

<p>Aquifer’s work will be guided by a variety of small working
group focusing in functional areas as necessary and including an <i>Architecture,
Design, and Implementation Group</i>, a <i>Collection Development Group</i>,
etc. </p>

<p>Key working groups may be assisted by fulltime program
managers who will administer and provide facilitated leadership for their work
and also follow up for on actions that required investigative and other efforts
over and above those which volunteer members might be expected to contribute.
In addition, program managers will provide the coordination necessary for
successful co-development effort that the Aquifer partners will undertake</p>

<p>A full draft business plan with details about the funding,
organization, and governance of Aquifer will be available for initial review in
January 2005 </p>

<p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>C. Partner commitments</span></b></p>

<p>Aquifer partners commit themselves to:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Contributing their openly accessible online information
     content to Aquifer virtual collections, ensuring that the contributed
     content meets Aquifer standards</li>
 <li>Adopting Aquifer benchmarks in the construction of new
     online collections</li>
 <li>Populating and maintaining Aquifer registries with
     relevant local information</li>
 <li>Aligning local development effort to support Aquifer’s aims
     and objectives and to enable effective co-development of essential tools
     and content<br>
     <br>
 </li>
</ul>

Thus a collection of online texts may be accessible with a range of analytical
features that support computer-based literary and linguistic analyses; a
collection of social science data is surrounded with visualization and
statistical processing tools, etc.</p>
