<h3>Level 2 Example</h3>
<p>This example was given by the University of Michigan Library.  It is part of a much longer work, truncations have been indicated here by "[ETC,...]". 
The example illustrates that the emphasis in "Level 2" texts is, like Level 1, on the descriptive and administrative metadata contained in 
the &lt;teiHeader&gt; and in conveying the textual object as a series of page images with loosely-encoded dirty OCR (usually not displayed) for 
searching.  However, what makes "Level 2" different is the effort made to facilitate navigation by encoding into the text more granular components such
as chapters of a novel, articles of a journal, and their appropriate headings.</p>

THE OLD GUARD,
A MONTHLY JOURNAL, DEVOTED TO THiE PRINCIPLES OF 1776 AND 1787.
VOLUME  II.-DECEMBER, 1864.-No.  XII.
THE OLD MONARCHIST PARTY OF THE UNITED STATES.
LUTHER MARTIN, in his report of the
Secret Debates of the Federal Constitutional Convention, 
gives the following account of the parties which appeared in that memorable body:
"There was one party, whose object and
wish is to abolish and annihilate all State
governments, and bring forward one general
government over this extensive continent, of
a monarchical nature.    *   *   The second party was not for the abolition of the
State governments, nor for the introduction
of a monarchical government in any form;
but they wish to establish such a system as
would give their own States undue power
and influence in the government of the other
States.
"A third party was what I consider truly
Federal Republican (or Democratic.) This
party was nearly equal in number with the
other two."
The leader of the monarchical party
was Alexander Hamilton.   He  introduced, for the consideration of the Convention, the draft of a Constitution
which elected a President for life, and
invested him with the power  of appointing the Governors of the States,
with a veto 6n the legislative acts of
the States, and many other similar
powers, which would have made the
Federal Government a monarchy in
everything but name.
This proposition had few advocates
in the Convention, and no portion of
Hamilton's draft was incorporated in
the Constitution finally adopted by the
Convention.
On this subject Colonel Humphreys
wrote to General Washington, on the
20th of January, 1787: "They (the
States) have a mortal reluctance to
divest themselves of the smallest attribute of independent, separate sovereignties."
In every conceivable way did the
consolidationists strive to incorporate
their principles into the new Constitution, but in every case they were foiled by the vigilant friends of State sovereignty. 
So averse was the Convention to everything that implied
consolidation, that it voted to expunge
the words National Government from
the Constitution, and insert in its place
United States.  In everyLhing the Republican, or Democratic party, triumphed, and it was supposed that the<span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

party, were silenced forever. The debates, in all the States, on the adoption of the Constitution, demonstrated

THIE OLD KNIGHT'S DAUGHTER.
The old Knight bid his daughter fair
To lay her hand on his whitened hair.
"Now daughter fair," the old Knight said,
Swear by your father's sacred head:
Swear that the young Lord Ellendower
You will forsake from this same hour."
"Now," said the old Knights daughter fair,
I swear by my father's whitened hair,
That to the young Lord Ellendower
I yet will cling from this same hour I"
The grey. old Knight, with a flashing eye,
Swore that his daughter fair should die.
That his sabre old, so long at rest,
Should drink the blood of her virgin breast!
And the old Knight bent his whitened head
Sadly down o'er his daughter dead.

THE DOOM, AND THE REGENERATION OF DEMOCRACY.
The Speech in full of  C. Chauncey Burr, delivered in Bergen County, N. J., the
afternoon before the late election.
Mr. President and fellow-citizens: I
have consented, to address you this afternoon with no expectation of influencing the ballot of to-morrow.  At
this late hour it is to be presumed that
every man's mind is made up.  I am
here to gratify the wish of my friends.
I shall speak as though the election
had already passed-like a man who
believes the fate of his country is
sealed beyond the rcach of present, or
immediate effort. The die is cast. Today is as thoughl to-morrow's sun had
risen and set. If the result is ruin to
our country, it is now too late to avert

-A respectable lady sends us the follo-ving translation of a French verse, which she
found in an old Paris newspaper, without the
name of the author:
Love holds dominion o'er my breast,
And all my senses doth enslave;
He is the foe of tranquil rest,
Nor quits us'till we'ere in the grave;
He is a foe,
He is a fire;
The source of -woe,
Or soft desire.
AM! would my goddess smile, I then might
show
That bliss was love, not love of bliss thl foe.
