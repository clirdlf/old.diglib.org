<h2>DLF Draft Strategy and Business Plan. Executive Summary</h2>

11 March 2000 <br />
D Greenstein 

<p>The draft strategy and business plan derives from an intensive
review of key challenges confronted by DLF members in developing
their digital libraries. The review acted in part as an informal
evaluation of the DLF and that perspective has been brought to
bear on the strategy's construction. The document has benefited
from numerous comments received by email, and from focused
consideration of a small group convened on 8-9 March 2000 in Ann
Arbor. This executive summary highlights key proposals and
includes recommendations arising in the course of the strategy's
preliminary review.</p>

<p>The review clearly demonstrated the accomplishments already
achieved by the DLF through members' collaboration e.g. in
leading edge digital library research and development, in
enhancing understanding of good practices, and in building
community amongst digital library practitioners. It also revealed
an interest in:</p>

<ul>
<li>activity beyond the architectural and technical areas where
DLF has focused;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater emphasis on evaluating, documenting, and
disseminating the results of work conducted within the DLF;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater inclusiveness within work conducted within the
DLF;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater information sharing amongst member institutions about
their digital library practices, strategies, organizations,
etc.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater emphasis on community building amongst digital
library practitioners;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>continued emphasis on attracting funding as essential to
digital library research and development.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following nine key proposals are offered for members'
consideration.</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The DLF should have the following core aims (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec12">section 1.2</a>):

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Promoting information sharing amongst members to raise
awareness about digital library tools, methods, trends, and
strategies, and to inform and help validate local digital library
activities, decisions, and investments.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Sharing digital library practices and experiences in a range
of areas with a view to evolving understanding of good practice.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Stimulating research and development work in areas that bear
directly on the development, maintenance and use of digital
libraries and are not being developed (or fully developed) by
existing organizations.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Attracting external funding to support essential digital
library research and development.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Responding quickly to digital library challenges as they
arise.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Working closely with proximate professional and other
associations.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Investing in and helping to build professional communities
appropriate to the development of digital libraries and their
staff.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF should continue working on technical and
architectural issues (sections <a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec21">2.1</a> and <a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec23">2.3</a>) while investigating other
digital library challenges not fully engaged by existing
organizations. Such challenges include: 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Collections strategies (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec22">section
2.2</a>.) - that is content blind or content neutral issues
surrounding the creation, development, and maintenance of digital
collections (e.g. economic models, rights issues). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Human factors (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec24">section 2.4</a>)
that bear on our understanding and development of digital library
architectures, standards, tools, and collections. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Digital preservation (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec25">section
2.5</a>) particularly in the identification of good preservation
practices and organizational and economic models. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Strategic, policy, organizational, and economic issues (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec26">section 2.6</a>) associated with the
library's changing roles and institutional relationships. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Research, development, and other activities that emerge
outside of existing program areas or that cross those program
areas (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec27">section 2.7</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>In addressing itself to these challenges, priority should be
given to the following. 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Reconvening the "architecture committee" to advise the DLF in
work on digital library standards, architectures and tools (work
is underway or in preparation on structural and administrative
and its use integrating digital library holdings; text and image
metadata; mechanisms for integrating access to distributed,
heterogeneous item-level digital library holdings; digital
certificates; reference linking; persistent identifiers; "open
source" software development and exchange; integrating access to
pre-print services and collections).

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Establishing other expert advisory groups to investigate the
viability of work in collections strategies (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec22">section 2.2</a>), human factors (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec24">section 2.4</a>), and strategic and
policy areas (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec26">section 2.6</a>). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Convening task forces respectively to investigate models for
developing, integrating access to, and preserving distributed
social science and government data collections and to review and
elaborate collection strategies and organizational and business
models as being developed by the Academic Image Cooperative
(under <a href="dlfplan.htm#sec28">section 2.8</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF's organization should reflect is aims of agility;
conducting, reviewing, and widely disseminating results of
collaborative research and development work in key areas;
information sharing and community building amongst the membership
(<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec31">section 3.1.</a>). It should
comprise a small Secretariat with catalytic, facilitating, and
communications functions. It should also comprise a small
Executive Committee responsible for the DLF's policies, programs,
funding and evaluation, and for monitoring and advising the work
of the Secretariat. The DLF should also include a number of
working groups focusing in key areas so long as they remain
viable and valuable to the membership and responsible for
documenting, reviewing, and disseminating work in those areas for
the benefit of the membership. Such groups may include:

<ol>
<li>standing expert groups (called Program Advisory Groups)
modeled after the architecture committee and taking
responsibility for identifying and developing viable research and
information sharing agendas and for building professional
communities capable of addressing digital library challenges as
they arise in key areas (e.g. collection strategies, human
factors, etc);</li>

<li>Task Forces convened on an ad hoc, short-term basis whether
by Program Advisory Groups or by other means and responsible for
focused research, development and other practical
activities.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF should host a regular Forum (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec31">section 3.1</a>.) to serve as meeting
places and market places for the Executive Committee, the Program
Advisory Groups, the Task Forces, and the broader professional
community represented in the membership. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should develop and maintain strategic alliances with
library and other organizations that have a stake in or
contribution to make to digital library developments (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec31">section 3.1</a>.). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should develop a communications infrastructure
capable of facilitating, assessing, and disseminating outputs
that result from its members' collaborative work, and of
encouraging information exchange and community building across
the membership (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec32">section 3.2</a>.). At
a minimum, the communications infrastructure should comprise
mailing lists open to DLF members; a web-based publication
series; regularly published web-based newsletter comprising brief
progress reports on DLF initiatives and reports from members
about any new grants, projects, services, collections, etc., and
about any key challenges they are addressing locally; a
web-accessible database or clearing house pointing at sources of
information, expertise, etc. within the member institutions.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>DLF funds should be distributed to facilitate collaborative
efforts, information sharing, and community building amongst DLF
members (<a href="dlfplan.htm#sec33">Section 3.3</a>). They
should maintain a small secretariat and the DLF Forum, and help
support expert (Program Advisory) groups. They should also assist
Task Forces in their planning phases. All DLF initiatives should
be encouraged and supported in their efforts to sustain
themselves through participants' co-investment and with external
funding, and the DLF should consider increasing funds available
to the program as a whole. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should move forward in three phases (<a
href="dlfplan.htm#sec4">Section 4</a>) as follows: 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>A brief and aggressive re-organizational phase (to June 2000)
to establish essential organizational and communications
mechanisms; to convene expert advisory groups to identify viable
research, development, and information sharing agenda in key
program areas (e.g. architectures, standards, and tools;
collection strategies; human factors); and to convene task forces
in selected areas.</li>

<li>A longer developmental phase (to June 2001) during which time
emphasis is shifted to the research, development, information
sharing, and community building work of the expert groups, task
forces, and Forums.</li>

<li>An evaluative phase (to June 2002) extending the applied
efforts referenced in 9.2. above and including an independent
formal evaluation of the DLF that may inform any discussion about
its future.</li>
</ol>
</li>
