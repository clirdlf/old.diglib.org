<h2>DRAFT TEXT OF LETTER TO CROSSREF</h2>

Prepared by Dale Flecker, 2 Feb 2000 <br />
Edited for presentation to the DLF Steering Committee by D Greenstein, 5 Mar 2000 

<p>The undersigned are a group of research libraries actively
engaged in acquiring and delivering electronic journals to their
constituencies.  We have read with considerable interest and
excitement the announcements concerning CrossRef, which we
believe to be a major development in this arena, with significant
potential for increasing the utility of e-journals.  The ability
to navigate easily between related articles, tracing the
&ldquo;web&rdquo; of thought and research on a topic, is
something widely desired by scholars and is of obvious great
utility.</p>

<p>We are writing, however, to express one concern we have about
the current technical underpinnings of CrossRef.  We understand
that CrossRef will use the DOI and PubRef identifiers and
resolution systems to provide address look-up for linking
purposes.  The PubRef system provides a limited but useful
mechanism to support selective linkage to more than one copy of
an article when such exists.  It is our understanding that at
this point the DOI, the primary pointing mechanism CrossRef will
use, does not have such a facility.  As it is currently being
implemented, the DOI will give access only to the copy of an
article mounted by the publisher doing the original
registration.  If an institution has an alternate location from
which its users should get access to an article, this alternate
copy will not be found.</p>

<p>In the current environment there are two major sources of
alternative copies for e-journal articles: locally loaded
copies, and materials provided by &ldquo;aggregator&rdquo;
services (OCLC, EBSCO, IAC, Bell and Howell, Ovid, etc.).  Among
our libraries, we have identified the following instances where
our users have access to alternate copies of articles that will
not be represented in the DOI resolution service:...</p>

<p>In addition to these two current types of sources for
alternate copies, there are at least two other areas receiving
considerable attention today that are likely to introduce yet
more complexity into the question of finding an
&ldquo;appropriate copy&rdquo; of an article for users: e-print
services and archiving initiatives.  A number of publishers are
now cooperating with organized e-print services (Cornell, for
instance, is actively developing plans for e- print services in
specific STM areas), and these will represent alternative sources
for some journal articles. The research library community has
been active engaged in discussions with publishers in recent
months about the need for independent archival storage of
e-journals to insure long-term availability and preservation.  It
is highly likely that these discussions will lead to initiatives
which will create yet more alternate copies of articles, copies
which over time will need to be encompassed in any citation
linking infrastructure.</p>

<p>We are writing today for a couple of purposes.  First, while
we know that this issue is one CrossRef recognizes, we would like
to emphasize its importance to us, and we believe to a number of
CrossRef publishers.  The publishers of journals (along with the
editors of journals and the authors of articles) have a great
interest in promoting the widest availability of their
publications, regardless of the location of the copy accessed
(assuming, of course, the copy is accessed under the appropriate
license).  Making reference linking work across all legal copies
of articles serves the best interests of scholars, libraries, and
publishers.  Second, we recognize that the issue of
&ldquo;appropriate copy&rdquo; linking is technically complex
(several of the signers have written papers on possible technical
approaches), and that considerable thought and discussion will be
required to identify appropriate solutions.  We would like to
volunteer to participate in any way appropriate in such
discussions, and to serve as beta sites for testing possible
solutions.</p>

<p>Reference linking is an exciting development, providing
functionality and convenience impossible in the paper journal
world.  Like most useful technologies it presents technical
challenges if it is to be addressed in the most general and
powerful manner.  We heartily applaud the CrosssRef initiative,
and hope that we can help with developing reference linking in a
way that will best serve all of the players in the e-journal
environment!<br />
