<h2><a id="exsum" name="exsum"></a>Executive summary</h2>

The draft strategy and business plan derives from an intensive
review of key challenges confronted by DLF members in developing
their digital libraries. The review acted in part as an informal
evaluation of the DLF and that perspective has been brought to
bear on the strategy's construction. 

<p>This executive summary highlights key proposals and includes
recommendations arising in the course of the strategy's
preliminary review. It reflects the numerous comments received by
email, and the more focused consideration of the draft strategy
given by a small group convened on 8-9 March 2000 in Ann
Arbor.</p>

<p>The review clearly demonstrated the accomplishments already
achieved by the DLF through members' collaboration e.g. in
leading edge digital library research and development, in
enhancing understanding of good practices, and in building
community amongst digital library practitioners. It also revealed
an interest in:</p>

<ul>
<li>activity beyond the architectural and technical areas where
DLF has focused;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater emphasis on evaluating, documenting, and
disseminating the results of work conducted within the DLF;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater inclusiveness within work conducted within the
DLF;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater information sharing amongst member institutions about
their digital library practices, strategies, organizations,
etc.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>greater emphasis on community building amongst digital
library practitioners;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>continued emphasis on attracting funding as essential to
digital library research and development.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following nine key proposals are offered for members'
consideration.</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>The DLF should have the following core aims (<a
href="#sec12">section 1.2</a>):

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Promoting information sharing amongst members to raise
awareness about digital library tools, methods, trends, and
strategies, and to inform and help validate local digital library
activities, decisions, and investments.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Sharing digital library practices and experiences in a range
of areas with a view to evolving understanding of good practice.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Stimulating research and development work in areas that bear
directly on the development, maintenance and use of digital
libraries and are not being developed (or fully developed) by
existing organizations.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Attracting external funding to support essential digital
library research and development.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Responding quickly to digital library challenges as they
arise.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Working closely with proximate professional and other
associations.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Investing in and helping to build professional communities
appropriate to the development of digital libraries and their
staff.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF should continue working on technical and
architectural issues (sections <a href="#sec21">2.1</a> and <a
href="#sec23">2.3</a>) while investigating other digital library
challenges not fully engaged by existing organizations. Such
challenges include: 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Collections strategies (<a href="#sec22">section 2.2</a>.) -
that is content blind or content neutral issues surrounding the
creation, development, and maintenance of digital collections
(e.g. economic models, rights issues). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Human factors (<a href="#sec24">section 2.4</a>) that bear on
our understanding and development of digital library
architectures, standards, tools, and collections. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Digital preservation (<a href="#sec25">section 2.5</a>)
particularly in the identification of good preservation practices
and organizational and economic models. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Strategic, policy, organizational, and economic issues (<a
href="#sec26">section 2.6</a>) associated with the library's
changing roles and institutional relationships. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Research, development, and other activities that emerge
outside of existing program areas or that cross those program
areas (<a href="#sec27">section 2.7</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>In addressing itself to these challenges, priority should be
given to the following. 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Reconvening the "architecture committee" to advise the DLF in
work on digital library standards, architectures and tools (work
is underway or in preparation on structural and administrative
and its use integrating digital library holdings; text and image
metadata; mechanisms for integrating access to distributed,
heterogeneous item-level digital library holdings; digital
certificates; reference linking; persistent identifiers; "open
source" software development and exchange; integrating access to
pre-print services and collections).

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Establishing other expert advisory groups to investigate the
viability of work in collections strategies (<a
href="#sec22">section 2.2</a>), human factors (<a
href="#sec24">section 2.4</a>), and strategic and policy areas
(<a href="#sec26">section 2.6</a>). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Convening selected task forces for example, to investigate
models for developing, integrating access to, and preserving
distributed social science and government data collections; to
extend collaborative work conducted by representatives of DLF
members' text centers; and to review and elaborate collection
strategies and organizational and business models as being
developed by the Academic Image Cooperative (under <a
href="#sec28">section 2.8</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF's organization should reflect is aims of agility;
conducting, reviewing, and widely disseminating results of
collaborative research and development work in key areas;
information sharing and community building amongst the membership
(<a href="#sec31">section 3.1.</a>). It should comprise a small
Secretariat with catalytic, facilitating, and communications
functions. It should also comprise a small Executive Committee
responsible for the DLF's policies, programs, funding and
evaluation, and for monitoring and advising the work of the
Secretariat. The DLF should also include a number of working
groups focusing in key areas so long as they remain viable and
valuable to the membership and responsible for documenting,
reviewing, and disseminating work in those areas for the benefit
of the membership. Such groups may include:

<ol>
<li>standing expert groups (called Program Advisory Groups)
modeled after the architecture committee and taking
responsibility for identifying and developing viable research and
information sharing agendas and for building professional
communities capable of addressing digital library challenges as
they arise in key areas (e.g. collection strategies, human
factors, etc);</li>

<li>Task Forces convened on an ad hoc, short-term basis whether
by Program Advisory Groups or by other means and responsible for
focused research, development and other practical
activities.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The DLF should host a regular Forum (<a href="#sec31">section
3.1</a>.) to serve as meeting places and market places for the
Executive Committee, the Program Advisory Groups, the Task
Forces, and the broader professional community represented in the
membership. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should develop and maintain strategic alliances with
library and other organizations that have a stake in or
contribution to make to digital library developments (<a
href="#sec31">section 3.1</a>.). 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should develop a communications infrastructure
capable of facilitating, assessing, and disseminating outputs
that result from its members' collaborative work, and of
encouraging information exchange and community building across
the membership (<a href="#sec32">section 3.2</a>.). At a minimum,
the communications infrastructure should comprise mailing lists
open to DLF members; a web-based publication series; regularly
published web-based newsletter comprising brief progress reports
on DLF initiatives and reports from members about any new grants,
projects, services, collections, etc., and about any key
challenges they are addressing locally.</li>

<li>DLF funds should be distributed to facilitate collaborative
efforts, information sharing, and community building amongst DLF
members (<a href="#sec33">Section 3.3</a>). They should maintain
a small secretariat and the DLF Forum, and help support expert
(Program Advisory) groups. They should also assist Task Forces in
their planning phases. All DLF initiatives should be encouraged
and supported in their efforts to sustain themselves through
participants' co-investment and with external funding, and the
DLF should consider increasing funds available to the program as
a whole. 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF should move forward in three phases (<a
href="#sec4">Section 4</a>) as follows: 

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>A brief and aggressive re-organizational phase (to June 2000)
to establish essential organizational and communications
mechanisms; to convene expert advisory groups to identify viable
research, development, and information sharing agenda in key
program areas (e.g. architectures, standards, and tools;
collection strategies; human factors); and to convene task forces
in selected areas.</li>

<li>A longer developmental phase (to June 2001) during which time
emphasis is shifted to the research, development, information
sharing, and community building work of the expert groups, task
forces, and Forums.</li>

<li>An evaluative phase (to June 2002) extending the applied
efforts referenced in 9.2. above and including an independent
formal evaluation of the DLF that may inform any discussion about
its future.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="sec1" name="sec1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

The draft strategy and business plan is presented in four
sections. <a href="#sec1">Section 1</a> presents the definition
of a digital library that emerged from the review. It identifies
where members feel they are or should be active in order to
develop effective, affordable, and high-quality digital
libraries. It also presents aims for the DLF that represent
consensus about where the organization should focus its efforts.
<a href="#sec2">Section 2</a> clusters into program areas
convergent opinions about where the DLF should be active or at
least interested if it is to achieve its members' aims and
support their digital library ambitions. <a href="#sec2">Section
3</a> reflects discussions about how the DLF should organize and
support its efforts and includes a section on the communications
infrastructure that the DLF must develop to advance its program.
<a href="#sec4">Section 4</a> makes a series of recommendations
about next steps that DLF members might take to proceed with any
of the program areas that are outlined in the document. 

<p>Members should consider this document as a proposal; strategic
discussion about the following points is crucial:</p>

<ul>
<li>the proposed program areas and the priorities that might be
assigned to them;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>the structure and operational mechanisms that will allow the
membership to make some progress in any combination of program
areas;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>the costs of collaboration and how they may be met;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>steps that members might take by to carry out program
priorities that are agreed upon.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h3><a id="sec11" name="sec11"></a>1.1. Some definitions</h3>

The digital library extends the breadth and scale of scholarly
and cultural evidence and supports innovative research and
life-long learning. To do this, it mediates between diverse and
distributed information resources on the one hand and a changing
range of user communities on the other. In this capacity, it
establishes "a digital library service environment" - that is, a
networked, online information space in which users can discover,
locate, acquire access to and, increasingly, use information.
Although access paths will vary depending upon the resource in
question, the digital library service environment makes no
distinctions among information formats. Books, journals,
paper-based archives, video, film, and sound recordings are as
visible in the digital library service environment as are online
catalogs, finding aids, abstract and indexing services, e-journal
and e-print services, digitized collections, geographic
information systems, Internet resources, and other "electronic"
holdings. 

<p>In constructing a digital library service environment, the
library becomes responsible for configuring access to a world of
information of which it owns or manages only a part. Accordingly,
the digital library is known less for the extent and nature of
the collections it owns than for the networked information space
it defines through a range of online services. In the world of
commercial publishing, aggregators compete on the basis of the
value-added services that they layer on top of overlapping
electronic collections. Similarly, digital libraries establish
their distinctive identities, serve their user communities,
emphasize their owned collections, and promote their unique
institutional objectives by the way in which they disclose,
provide access to, and support the use of their increasingly
virtual collections.</p>

<p>The digital library service environment is not simply about
access to and use of information. It also supports the full range
of administrative, business and curatorial functions required by
the library to manage, administer, monitor engagement with, and
ensure fair use of its collections whether in digital or
non-digital formats, whether located locally or off site. The
digital library service environment integrates (and interfaces
with) information repositories that are characterized by
open-access shelving, high-density book stores and availability
via inter-library loan, and include data services and digital
archival repositories. It manages information about collections
and items within collections often throughout their entire life
cycle. It incorporates patron, lending, and other databases, and
integrates appropriate procedures for user registration,
authentication, authorization, and fee-transaction processing.
The digital library service environment may also evolve into a
networked learning space, providing access to and a curatorial
home for distance and life-long learning materials. The digital
library service environment is, in sum, an electronic information
space that supports very different views and very different uses
of the library. It is designed for the library's patrons as well
as for its professional staff and with an eye on the needs and
capacities of those who supply it with information content and
systems. It is built in the full knowledge that information
technologies will continue to change rapidly as will our
understanding of how they may be used effectively to support
education and cultural engagement. Finally it evolves as the
library's single most important core service and as such is
developed with a view to its financial and organizational
sustainability.<br />
</p>

<h3><a id="sec12" name="sec12"></a>1.2. The Digital Library
Federation</h3>

The Digital Library Federation (DLF) is a consortium of research
libraries that are transforming themselves and their historic
educational and cultural roles through their exploitation of
networked and digital technologies. Committed to pioneering
innovation, they seek through their confederation to lever their
collective influence, reputations, digital library investments,
and research and development capacities To achieve the following:

<ul>
<li>lower the costs of developing digital library service
environments;

<p></p>
</li>

<li>gain maximum value for every dollar spent in digital library
research and development;

<p></p>
</li>

<li>achieve a greater degree of predictability and consistency in
an information landscape where technologies and our understanding
of appropriate organizational, economic, and legal structures,
and of human behavior are all highly fluid; and

<p></p>
</li>

<li>create a space in which a dynamic community of digital
library practitioners may develop and flourish in the interests
of promoting and advancing their shared profession.</li>
</ul>

<p>The DLF is an organizational expression of its members' shared
interests, their collective will, and their collaborative
impulses. Members perceive the following roles for the
Federation's secretariat:</p>

<ul>
<li>to translate members' digital library aims into a shared
vision and a program capable of realizing it, maintaining both in
light of the members' changing needs and their changing
perceptions of opportunities;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>within the context of this program, to facilitate meaningful
collaboration amongst the DLF members and between DLF members and
other organizations;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>to maximize the impacts of collaborative initiatives while
lowering their entry and overhead costs;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>to establish and maintain strategic alliances with common
purpose library and other organizations in order to achieve
economies of scale and to maximize impacts of complementary
efforts;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>to promote the work of the DLF and its members to the wider
community thereby raising the organization's profile and
extending the influence of its members' work; and/LI&gt;

<p></p>
</li>

<li>to establish liaison with strategic and funding bodies and to
seek support from them for the DLF's program and its associated
dissemination activities.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2><a id="sec2" name="sec2"></a>2. Program areas</h2>

This section reflects the clustering of opinion that emerged from
the review about the areas in which the DLF should be active.
Program areas are defined in relation to key challenges as
commonly perceived across the membership. Strategies are proposed
that might help the membership to confront those challenges
collaboratively. Omitted from the document is any detailed
discussion of the task-level work that might take place within
program areas or the priorities that might be assigned to such
work. As recommended in <a href="#sec31">Section 3.1.</a>, those
discussions, in order to meaningful and actionable agreement,
need to take place among and be owned by expert Program Advisory
Groups derived directly from the membership. Convening that
discussion in Advisory Groups established for that purpose is
therefore recommended in <a href="#sec4">Section 4</a> as an
immediate next step for the DLF. 

<h3><a id="sec21" name="sec21"></a>2.1. Achieving greater
consistency, predictability, and interoperability within digital
library service environments</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: In developing a digital library service
environment, the library seeks to enable meaningful navigation
through and exploitation of distributed and heterogeneous
information resources that are stored and managed in different
formats. Users require this level of integration. Interested in
gaining access to relevant information quickly and efficiently,
regardless of format and location, they are not contented with
networked environments that require, for example, that queries be
launched repeatedly at different collections and indices, or the
incorporation of numerous authentication barriers. Collection
development and maintenance, and business incentives too, also
compel a more integrating approach. At present, new information
resources and the managerial and user service functions that are
associated with them are bolted onto digital library service
environments in an <i>ad hoc</i>, often proprietary fashion. The
approach does not scale cost effectively across the range of
information resources and services that need to be incorporated
into and supported by the digital library service environment; it
has debilitating impacts on the environment's functionality,
usefulness, administration and maintenance, and it creates
tangible limitations on collections development and use. 

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Seek greater consistency and
predictability across the digital library service environment and
interoperability among the information content and information
services that are deployed within it by identifying and
articulating minimum-level preferences for content and services,
and levering the membership's collective influence to promote
their widest possible adoption. The following may be conducted
within this program area:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifying and documenting minimum level preferences for the
data and metadata formats of those content classes typically
included in digital library service environments (e.g. online
public access catalogues, finding aids, and other collection
indices; arts and abstracting databases, electronic journals,
electronic books, image and text databases, spatially referenced
data, and statistical data).</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Identifying and documenting minimum level functional
requirements for systems and services and an integrating
architecture that identifies the inter-relationships and
inter-dependencies of those systems and services, and includes
references to appropriate and preferred standards and
protocols.[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Selecting content and system requirements and preferences
with a view to their deployment in an integrating digital library
service environment, their sustainability through changing
technical regimes, their functionality and use, their
extensibility, and the costs associated with their deployment,
maintenance, and modification.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Organizationally endorsing and promoting more widespread
adoption of minimum level content and system preferences to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>focus, integrate, and minimize the costs of developing local
digital library service environments;</li>

<li>influence and inform content and systems suppliers and
developers thereby minimizing their impacts on the development
and maintenance of local services.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Developing and disseminating implementation guidelines,
decision-making, and other tools to inform, encourage, and supply
compelling incentives for the widest possible adoption and
deployment of such preferences, recognizing that different
communities may require different iterations of these tools.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec22" name="sec22"></a>2.2. Collections
development</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: A digital library provides access to both
digital and non-digital objects. The library's "collections" are
vastly extended to include third-party objects, information
sources, and information services over which the library has
little or no curatorial control.[<a href="#fn2">2</a>] The
library's collection development functions are similarly
extended. While maintaining its historic curatorial role with
regard to analog and paper-based holdings, it takes on additional
functions more closely associated with the digital repository or
data service and the Internet portal. 

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Develop, evaluate, and apply collection
development strategies that reflect the fundamental changes in
the nature, extent, maintenance, and use of library collections.
Ensure that these strategies support the library as it seeks
systematically, cost-effectively, and with minimum redundancy to
work in integrated service environments to assemble, coherently
present, and actively and programmatically manage deeply
heterogeneous and extensively distributed scholarly and cultural
information resources. The following tasks may be conducted
within this program area:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing and promoting minimum level content and service
preferences (see <a href="#sec21">Section 2.1.</a> above) that
take account of the need to integrate access to and management of
heterogeneous information content drawn from:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>locally managed paper-based and analog collections and the
inter-library lending services that provide access to such
collections managed by third parties;</li>

<li>digital information supplied commercially by third parties
and which may be managed either locally or off site;</li>

<li>digital information available non-commercially from third
parties and which may be managed locally or off site; and</li>

<li>digital objects created locally whether they are born digital
or created as surrogates for locally managed paper-based and
analog objects.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Developing guidelines and tools for decision making that help
ensure that all collection development decisions (that is
decisions taken with regard to all of the information sources
enumerated above) are informed with a view of the preferences
referenced above and thus of the short-, medium-, and long-term
costs associated with their inclusion by whatever means into a
digital library service environment.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Developing a better understanding of users' information
requirements and their behaviors in digital library service
environments (including methodologies appropriate to assessing
and anticipating those requirements and behaviors) and informing
all collection development decisions in light of that
understanding (see <a href="#sec24">Section 2.4.</a> below).</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Extending the breadth and scale of collections by penetrating
and mobilizing communities that produce non-commercial electronic
information with educational and cultural value. By developing
capacity as portal and repository services, and by offering tools
and other incentives to data producers so that they turn to the
library for access to those services, DLF members may lever their
reputation and authority to significantly enhance their
"collections". They stand in particular to benefit from:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Electronic indices and digital surrogates being created by
regional libraries and other cultural organizations. Typically
these organizations will wish to achieve a greater level of
access to their online holdings than they can attract. Many will
also recognize the importance of preserving these digital assets
but will not have the capacity to mount appropriate or effective
digital preservation programs.</li>

<li>Primary research and other "unpublished" data produced by
academic communities and professional societies. Here, too, there
is a growing recognition of the direct benefits that accrue from
disclosing such data through more comprehensive, high-quality
online portal services and securing them through changing
technical regimes.</li>

<li>Educational and cultural data resources created with grant
funding. Increasingly, funding agencies are becoming aware that
the value of their investments in digital information are only
fully realized if such data are assembled into professionally
managed collections, made accessible in the context of related
information, and maintained over the longer term.</li>

<li>Data produced by government agencies and commercial
organizations and possessing substantial scholarly and cultural
but [time] limited commercial value.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Where commercially available data are concerned, initiating
formal dialogue with their suppliers on a range of licensing,
rights, business, and fair use issues that keep both libraries
and data suppliers from taking best advantage of the
opportunities afforded them in a digital environment. Here, the
DLF might look for a model to the UK at the co-operative
undertakings of the Higher Education Funding Councils' Joint
Information Systems Committee and the Publishers' Association
(PA). [<a href="#fn3">3</a>] Through a series of working parties,
the JISC/PA has made progress in a number of important areas
affecting the scope and latitude available to the library in how
it manages, presents, encourages use of, and in selected cases
re-purposes commercially supplied data.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Placing the production of digital surrogates on a more
programmatic and sustainable footing, such as by developing and
disseminating guidelines that inform local digitization efforts
with a view to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>their likely use (by whom and for what purpose);</li>

<li>the costs involved in their integration into local digital
library service environments;</li>

<li>their potential for re-purposing so that they may support
multiple uses and user communities, and the costs involved in
that re-purposing; and</li>

<li>the costs associated in maintaining long-term access.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Exploring and assessing the costs and benefits associated
with various business models that promise to sustain digitization
efforts and their resulting online services beyond their initial
funding regimes by:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>using techniques derived from market research to assess
likely demand for and likely use of digital collections derived
from library holdings;</li>

<li>undertaking realistic and formal cost-benefit assessment of
revenue generating strategies other than those based on
access-based fee structures (e.g. corporate sponsorship of
digital collections, online advertising and through-sales,
wholesale licensing of collections to aggregators and other third
parties, or strategic alliances with commercial third
parties);</li>

<li>initiating formal dialogue with commercial publishers and
online content providers and learning from their business
strategies and experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec23" name="sec23"></a>2.3. Responding effectively to
rapid technical change</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: Libraries must continually identify and
experiment with new tools that promise to extend, enhance, or
improve the cost effectiveness, functionality, and educational
and cultural value of their services and collections; assess the
costs and benefits associated with deploying those tools; and
deploy selected tools in their digital library service
environments. The effort relies on scarce research and
development capacity that needs to be applied across an
ever-broadening range of new technologies. It also needs to be
applied with greater speed and efficiency. Given the rate and
pace of technical change, the time lapse between identification
of a potentially valuable new technology and its deployment in a
digital library service environment is constantly diminishing and
arguably already at only three years. It finally needs to be
applied with some urgency. The risks and costs associated with
any decision to deploy a new tool with existing collections or
services remain stable or are increasing. Accordingly, libraries
are investing in more tools, more often, and with less
information than at any time in the past. 

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Establish mechanisms that enable members
more efficiently, effectively, and meaningfully to share their
scarce research and development capacity, and thus to assemble a
research and development effort more appropriate to the demands
of rapidly changing technical regimes. The following tasks may be
associated with this effort:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating forums through which research and development staff
located at member institutions can effectively inform one another
about potentially valuable new tools as they become aware of them
and share results of any local experimentation with and
assessment of those tools.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Fostering shared experimentation and assessment where
appropriate.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Developing guidelines or decision trees that can be used
locally to inform evaluation of the different implementation
paths that may be deemed appropriate for deploying any new tools
in a digital library service environment. Clearly, any work
conducted by the DLF within this program area needs to cross
fertilize with that conducted elsewhere to achieve greater
consistency, predictability, and interoperability within digital
library service environments (see <a href="#sec21">Section
2.1.</a> above).</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Agreeing on and putting in place open-reference procedures
that enable local staff to share applications development work
where appropriate</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec24" name="sec24"></a>2.4. Penetrating and
mobilizing user communities</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: In a digital library, how information is
made, assembled into collections, and presented online affects
whether, to what extent, and how it can be used. A truism perhaps
but one that marks an incremental step for the library into an
arena traditionally occupied by the publisher. The statement is
not intended to re-open a tired and unhelpful debate about
whether the future holds a place for either the library or the
publisher. Rather, it demonstrates how our understanding of a
digital object's life cycle implies a need to engage differently
or, perhaps, just more deeply with our users in order to:

<ul>
<li>enhance our understanding of users' needs, aspirations and
behaviors as an essential design component of any online
collections and services we may develop; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>develop user support services that are appropriate to our
evolving digital library service environments and the new and
expanded communities that exploit them.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least three additional reasons to place user
relations on a revitalized - perhaps slightly different -
footing. Some user communities that surround the library are
producers of digital content, including research data,
dissertations, e-prints, and computer-assisted teaching
materials. That content has enormous educational and cultural
value, but only if it is assembled into professionally managed
collections, maintained over time, and made meaningfully
accessible to other end users through online portal and other
services. User communities may also possess the expertise or
knowledge that, when applied effectively to existing collections
can substantially enrich and enhance those collections, lending
new meaning to them, even making them accessible or
comprehensible to communities for which they were not initially
intended. In this regard, engaging with user communities is a
vital component of any effective collection development
policy.</p>

<p>Second, some user communities are aware of the tools they
require to manipulate information and are mobilizing, sometimes
on a large scale, to supply those tools - especially where they
are unavailable from the commercial sector. Ask a professional
archaeologist or a geographer about GIS; a musician or engineer
about the manipulation of sound data; an economist, social
scientist or astronomer about the management and analysis of
large-scale statistical data; a medic or a film producer about
the management and analysis of still or moving images. Just as
some user communities are poised as net suppliers of digital
content, others may be in a position to supply tools to a digital
library service environment that can enhance that environment's
functionality.</p>

<p>Third, digital library collections and services represent a
substantial and growing investment by libraries, educational
institutions, and other cultural organizations. Even where there
is no commercial imperative to mount such collections and
services on a cost recovery or revenue-generating basis, there
will be significant pressure to measure performance and value of
investment in terms of use. By engaging with user communities
more effectively, libraries can inform investment decisions by
anticipating their potential benefits (and beneficiaries, where
some financial return on investment is sought).</p>

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Engage more effectively with user
communities to build better, more useful, and more useable
collections and services. Provide essential data about user
markets that may inform decisions about investment in digital
library collections or services irrespective of whether any
financial return on investment is sought from them. Build
sustainable user support services that encourage the use of and
are appropriate to our evolving digital library service
environments. The following tasks may be associated with this
program area:</p>

<ol>
<li>Developing, documenting, and disseminating quantitative and
qualitative methods appropriate to assessing the online
information requirements, behaviors and preferences of well
defined user communities, and applying these methods in
systematically conducted, scientifically controlled, and
essentially comparative investigations.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Creating forums through which staff located at member
institutions can inform one another and learn from their
collective experience in penetrating and mobilizing user
communities not only as consumers of digital library services but
also as suppliers of content, contextual knowledge, and
tools.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Exploring and, where appropriate, developing services, tools,
organizational and business mechanisms, and information and
training materials that promise cost effectively to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>encourage and enrich widespread and appropriate use of
digital library service environments;</li>

<li>encourage users to supply content, contextual and
interpretative knowledge, and tools to digital library service
environments; and</li>

<li>support the work of reference librarians who mediate between
a growing community of users on the one hand and broadening
digital library service environments on the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec25" name="sec25"></a>2.5. Long-term access to
digital information objects</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: After some years of considering digital
preservation challenges, strategies and methods, a select few
libraries and library organizations appear poised to establish
digital archival repositories. The emergence of such repositories
suggest that digital libraries are likely to take up to three new
roles in some combination: as digital archival repositories; as
consumers of digital materials that are supplied by third parties
and preserved under license by third party repositories; as
creators of digital materials deposited in digital archival
repositories for the purposes of their long-term preservation. As
they explore the organizational, economic, and legal implications
of these new roles, digital libraries will also need to continue
research, development, and information sharing in related areas. 

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Support and inform the development of
digital archival repositories serving the library community by
helping to identify appropriate functional, organizational and
economic models for those repositories and the various roles that
libraries may play in their development and use. Continue
research, development, and information sharing in less understood
areas that bear on digital preservation. Tasks that may be
conducted in this area are identified below.</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>With regard to the establishment of digital archival
repositories, the DLF membership may wish to help:

<ul>
<li>identify and validate the minimum functional requirements
that digital archival repositories must meet if they are to suit
the needs and purposes of digital libraries;</li>

<li>identify licensing models that appropriately govern the
three-way relationships between digital content suppliers,
libraries as consumers of digital content, and any digital
archival repositories that may emerge to ensure long-term access
to such content; and</li>

<li>identify accreditation, organizational, and governing models
that help engender trust in digital archival repositories, ensure
appropriate levels of redundancy in archival effort, and ensure
some level of co-ordination across distributed archival
repositories.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Where general research, development, and information sharing
efforts are concerned, the following emerge from the review as
pressing issues.

<ul>
<li>Special collections and archives that continue to accession
and hold twentieth-century materials are beginning to explore
methods appropriate to the conservation of analog film, sound,
and video recordings, and the management of materials accessioned
in native digital formats. Their information needs and interests
are not yet fully met by digital preservation research and
development efforts.</li>

<li>Research into the digital preservation strategies and
practices that may be appropriate to digital libraries is not yet
fully informed by any assessment of the value that digital
information holds for those libraries or for the institutions in
which they are embedded. Where university libraries are concerned
that assessment will arguably require some fuller understanding
of the university's disposition towards its information assets as
broadly construed and the library's role in helping to manage
those assets over the longer term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h3><a id="sec26" name="sec26"></a>2.6. Understanding and
influencing new policy and civic contexts</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: By developing digital library service
environments the library incrementally but no less fundamentally
changes its institutional roles and responsibilities. Delivering
digital library services it:

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>has a greater and more direct influence over the nature,
character, and possibilities surrounding learning, teaching, and
cultural engagement; and</li>

<li>challenges traditional relationships that apply within the
institution in which it is established and externally with
museums, archives and proximate cultural organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible developmental trajectories and their organizational,
business, and legal implications must to be identified and
articulated; they establish a context and a vital orientation for
the work required, for example, on digital library architectures,
collections, user support and user services, and on digital
preservation. Yet this essential framing activity is one that
cannot be undertaken by library professionals acting in
isolation. Rather, it needs to be conducted through focused
cross-party dialogue with others who have an important stake in
the emergence of networked information and digital library
service environments.</p>

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Explore and evaluate possible
developmental trajectories, roles and responsibilities for the
library, and their associated organizational, business, and legal
implications. Document and share local experiences and practices
that may signpost potentially fruitful and strategic
trajectories. Conduct explorations and activities in an
essentially cross-party environment. Self-consciously use the
results of these explorations to shape the digital library
research and development agenda. Possible tasks that may included
in this program area include:</p>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Establish cross-party working groups or task forces (at a
minimum comprising senior educators and educational
administrators) to explore potential roles for the library in:

<ul>
<li>developing, managing, and disseminating educational assets;
and</li>

<li>supporting computer-based and distance learning and
teaching.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Establish cross-sectoral working groups (at a minimum
comprising representatives of museums, archives, and library
communities) to re-evaluate new roles and responsibilities in an
emerging networked civic space.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec27" name="sec27"></a>2.7. Cross-program areas</h3>

<b>The challenge</b>: By identifying program areas that reflect
communities of interest across the DLF membership, and by
providing organizational mechanisms to encourage research,
development, and information sharing within those areas the DLF
runs a number of related risks. It may:

<ul>
<li>put unnecessary obstacles in the path of important research,
development, and other activities that arise outside of or cross
program areas;</li>

<li>inhibit the emergence of new program areas in response to
members' changing needs and interests; and</li>

<li>prolong activity in existing program areas beyond its
perceived usefulness and value to the membership.</li>
</ul>

<b>The strategy</b>: Encourage initiatives that emerge from
outside of or deal with concerns that cross existing program
areas. Ensure periodic review of work undertaken within program
areas. Support dialogue and information sharing across program
areas. The strategy's success relies heavily on organizational
and communications mechanisms that are dealt with in Sections <a
href="#sec31">3.1</a>. and <a href="#sec32">3.2</a>.
respectively. Tasks indicated below are drawn from existing DLF
activity whether under way or in preparation. They are indicative
of important work that would not be conducted if the DLF adhered
to strictly to any programmatic orientation.

<ol>
<li>Work amongst member text centers has developed agreements
pertaining to the use of the Text Encoding Initiative's header
that represent a significant step toward greater consistency and
interoperability across their collections. They have also
prepared implementation guidelines for the TEI's use in different
kinds of digitization projects. The text centers are at present
developing an agenda that may inform their further collaborative
efforts.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Social science data archivists and government data librarians
are interested in collaborating to encourage greater
interoperability across their distributed collections and a more
co-ordinated approach to the development and preservation of
collections comprising social science and government data.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The Academic Image Co-operative presents a compelling and
potentially very valuable model for developing digital
collections that serve specific educational uses in art history.
That model needs to be reviewed by a broader group of art
historians and visual resource specialists so that it may be
elaborated in practice.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h2><a id="sec3" name="sec3"></a>3. Organizational and business
issues</h2>

<b>The challenge</b>: The DLF is a loose confederation of
independent libraries co-operating on a broad range of research,
development, and other activities to advance their own aims and
objectives in establishing digital library service environments.
The DLF's program derives its significance, relevance, and
potential from one source - the intellectual ownership and
direction supplied by its members. The program relies for its
fulfillment primarily upon members' professional staff who
combine the necessary expertise and experience with a compelling
need to share the costs of their digital library research,
development and other efforts. It relies for its fulfillment but
also for its impact on an effective communications strategy. That
strategy must be capable of facilitating the free flow of
information upon which any collaborative endeavor will depend and
on the summary, synthesis, and dissemination of its results.
Given the rate and pace of technical change, and an immature but
rapidly evolving understanding of the library's roles and
responsibilities within a networked space, the DLF must also
remain capable of identifying and responding to new challenges
and opportunities as they arise. Finally, the DLF must organize
itself and its initiatives with the recognition that it exists
outside a hierarchical structure capable of driving and
motivating participation in its program and without a budget
large enough to drive and motivate participation with the promise
of remunerative reward. 

<p><b>The strategy</b>: Create, deploy, and support
organizational mechanisms that ensure that the DLF's program is
derived from, responsive to, owned by, and realized through its
members. Develop and implement a communications strategy to
support and encourage the appropriate, wide ranging and free flow
of information upon which the DLF's program depends for its
development and its impact. Facilitate and motivate shared
participation in any applied and practical work associated with
the program's development, and reduce the entry and overhead
costs associated with such participation.</p>

<p>Tasks associated with this strategy are presented as
recommendations to the membership under three heads: <a
href="#sec31">organizations</a>, <a
href="#sec32">communications</a>, and <a
href="#sec33">resources</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="sec31" name="sec31"></a>3.1. Organizations</h3>

The DLF should comprise:

<ul>
<li>a streamlined Executive Committee responsible for policy,
programs, and evaluation;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Program Advisory Groups which guide and integrate efforts in
each of the DLF's core program areas;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Task Forces responsible for the focused research,
development, and other practical and applied work conducted
within program areas;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Forums that serve as meeting places and market places for the
Executive Committee, the Program Advisory Groups, the Task
Forces, and the broader professional community represented in the
membership;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>robust, practical, and mutually advantageous strategic
relations with proximate library and other organizations sharing
common purposes; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>a Secretariat, comprising a few program officers, that is
responsible to the membership and will serve a range of
inter-related strategic, catalytic, facilitating, supporting,
informational, promotional, and business development
functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These bodies should work to agreed guidelines outlining their
respective roles and responsibilities and ensuring that their
work promotes the aims of the DLF and its members, and is
communicated effectively to the members and the broader
community.</p>

<p>The composition, function, and inter-relationships of each of
these bodies are outlined in greater detail below.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Executive Committee The Executive Committee should be
responsible to the membership for the Federation's policies,
programs, and evaluation, and for the effective delivery of the
Secretariat's services. The Executive Committee may:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>advise on the DLF's policies and program priorities and the
allocation of its resources and efforts across its program
areas;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>ensure appropriate levels of cross-fertilization between and
among the various program areas;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>ensure that the work of the DLF is implemented cost
effectively and that it provides value for money to the
membership;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>assist the DLF Secretariat, its Program Advisory Groups, and
its Task Forces in cultivating advantageous strategic
partnerships in any other relevant business development and
fund-raising activities;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>advise the Secretariat and ensure appropriate allocation of
its resources;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>monitor the provision of any services for which the
Secretariat is or becomes responsible, using agreed service
levels and milestones where appropriate; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>assist in the formal evaluation of the DLF and provide advice
to the membership and funding partners about continuing the
DLF.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Committee's size should reflect the need for decisive
executive action. Members should include representatives from at
least three important constituencies to ensure proper levels of
exchange among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>directors of the member institutions (e.g., librarians or
their equivalents);</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>chairs of Program Advisory Groups; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>a lay constituency drawing participation and perspective from
outside the membership or the library sector.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mechanisms for electing Executive Committee members and
recommendations pertaining to their tenure are left for
discussion, as are mechanisms that may ensure the Committee's
accountability to the membership.</p>
</li>

<li>Program Advisory Groups Program Advisory Groups should be
established to guide and integrate the DLF's work in each of its
program areas. In this respect, they may:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>be responsible to the Executive Committee for the aims,
objectives, priorities and funds allocated for work within a
program area;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>recommend the establishment of, help prepare the charges for,
and allocate funding to any Task Force as may be required to
achieve aims and objectives that have been assigned
priority;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>establish and help to implement criteria against which Task
Force outputs will be evaluated in the context of the DLF's
program objectives and their potential influence on local digital
library practices;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>advise the Secretariat in facilitating, supporting,
documenting, and disseminating the learning and other outputs
that result from the work of the Task Forces; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>advise the Secretariat and the Executive Committee on
strategies for promoting, encouraging the adoption of, or
otherwise endorsing Task Force outputs, extending their
influence, and enhancing their impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Program Advisory Groups should comprise senior professionals
(AUL or equivalent and above) from within the DLF who have
relevant and demonstrable expertise, creativity, and vision. They
should include a chairperson responsible for the Group's
strategic development and direction and an individual working
full- or part-time on behalf of the DLF Secretariat by supporting
the chair, the Advisory Group, and any of its Task Forces in a
manner identified in <a href="#sec316">Section 3.1.6.</a>,
below.</p>

<p>For the sake of transparency, advisory group members should be
selected by the Executive Committee on the basis of expressions
of interest submitted to it upon invitation from the Secretariat.
Invitations for expressions of interest will at a minimum outline
the nature and level of expertise and skills that are sought from
advisory group members, the minimum level commitment that is
likely to be required of them, and any resource implications that
advisory group membership is likely to have for participants'
host institutions.</p>

<p>Given the DLF's strategic reliance upon effective Program
Advisory Groups, it may be appropriate to remunerate the chair
for his or her service. The matter is left for discussion, as is
the size of any Program Advisory Group. In conformance with their
recommended role, however, Advisory Groups should seek to involve
senior professionals from institutions with a spread of
experience and opinion as may be brought to bear fruitfully on
the development of any program area.</p>
</li>

<li>DLF Task Forces Task Forces should be established to conduct
focused research, development, and other practical and applied
work as deemed desirable and necessary by the Program Advisory
Groups in consultation with the Executive Committee. Task Forces
will be responsible to their Program Advisory Group and work to
charges developed by the Secretariat under the guidance of that
Group. Charges will at a minimum outline the aims, objectives,
milestones, and deliverables that are sought from any Task Force
and do so with explicit reference to the goals of the broader
program area in which it is conceived. They will indicate how
work of the Task Force will be assessed, documented,
disseminated, and promoted. In this regard, they will clearly
indicate milestones in a Task Force's development and the
criteria by which it may be deemed to have completed its work.
Assessment is intended solely as a means of ensuring formative
learning and not as a potentially punitive device. 

<p>For the sake of transparency, Task Force members should be
selected by the relevant Program Advisory Group on the basis of
expressions of interest submitted to it upon invitation from the
Secretariat. Invitations for expressions of interest will at a
minimum include the Task Force's charge, outline the nature and
level of expertise and skills that are sought from Task Force
members, indicate the minimum level commitment likely to be
required of Task Force members, and indicate any resource
implications that task force membership is likely to have for
participants' host institutions.</p>

<p>Task Forces should consist of small groups of professional
staff who have relevant and demonstrable experience and are,
within their own institutions, giving priority attention to work
in the area being addressed by the Task Force. Task Forces should
comprise a chair who is responsible for the work's strategic
direction and development, and the individual who is acting on
behalf of the DLF Secretariat by supporting work in the relevant
program area.</p>

<p>Given the DLlF's strategic reliance upon effective and
productive Task Forces, it may be appropriate to remunerate their
chairs. The matter is left for discussion.</p>
</li>

<li>DLF Forums Forums will serve as meeting places, as market
places, and as congresses. As meeting places they will provide an
opportunity for the Steering Committee, Program Advisory Groups,
and Task Forces to conduct their business and exchange ideas. As
market places, Forums will provide an opportunity for Task Forces
and Advisory Groups to present to a larger audience their work,
its progress and its likely impacts, and to benefit from the
views, perceptions and concerns that may be expressed by that
audience. Forums will also provide opportunities for a broader
level of information sharing between professional staff and
network development among them through thematically organized
public presentations and panel discussions, and through informal
interchange. As congresses, forums will provide an opportunity
for the DLF to continually review and assess it programs and
progress with input from the broader professional community. 

<p>Forums should be convened on a regular basis, scheduled and
announced substantially in advance, and at a minimum, open to
professional staff at DLF member institutions. Accommodation will
be made available at Task Forces for face-to-face meetings of
Task Forces, Program Advisory Groups and the Executive Committee
as required. More public presentations, panel discussions, and
opportunities for review of the DLF program may be scheduled by
the Secretariat in consultation with Program Advisory Groups and
the Steering Committee.</p>

<h3><a id="sec32" name="sec32"></a>3.2. Communications</h3>

Effective communications are vital to the DLF. They alone can
ensure that the DLF's program and program priorities respond to
the members' needs and interests. They also form the bedrock upon
which any effective and meaningful collaborative engagement will
be built. Communications are also essential for the DLF as it
sets out to inform its members and the broader library community
about the strategies, technologies, organizational mechanisms and
legal and business issues that have a direct bearing on the
development and cost effective maintenance of high-quality
digital library services and collections. Communications are
essential to the DLF's own business development. They provide a
means by which the DLF can promote itself, its members, and its
various activities to the broadest possible community. They also
provide a means by which the DLF can extend its influence and its
impacts, and in so doing, make the information landscape in which
its members operate more consistent and predictable than it is at
present. Finally, communications are essential to the DLF as it
seeks funding for and participation in its work from other
organizations that have a stake in or exercise significant
influence over that landscape. 

<p>An effective communications infrastructure will serve each of
these inter-related needs with minimum tolerable redundancy. It
is likely to include the following components.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Corporate Identity Levering the reputation and importance
of its members, the timeliness and significance of its program,
and the ability to deliver results in the guise of strategies,
practices, and approaches that are not only relevant but
influential beyond the narrow community represented by the
membership, a corporate identity will help the DLF to: 

<ul>
<li>raise awareness about the organization, its members, and its
activities;</li>

<li>amplify the impact and influence of its activities and
outputs; and</li>

<li>secure funding and other forms of support for the DLF.</li>
</ul>

<p>A corporate identity may be created by:</p>

<ul>
<li>adopting and consistently using the DLF logo in all DLF
publications, publicity materials, stationary, etc., whether in
electronic or paper-based formats;</li>

<li>using a DLF-specific Internet domain for the DLF Web site and
for e-mail addresses associated with DLF Secretariat staff
members irrespective of where they may be located;</li>

<li>consistently applying DLF branding across the DLF Web site;
and</li>

<li>effectively and consistently cross-referencing the DLF Web
site and the site(s) maintained by its members.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A network of electronic mailing lists (with accessible
archives) 

<ul>
<li>An electronic mailing list open to the public and used
primarily for one-way communication between the DLF Secretariat
and the broader public announcing the availability of new DLF
publications, reports, and other publicly accessible
outputs.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>An electronic mailing list open to staff at DLF member
institutions and permitting the one-way communication between the
DLF Secretariat and the broader membership, for example to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>announce new task forces and advisory groups and seek
expressions of interests from potential participants
therein;</li>

<li>announce new publications and other outputs that result from
various DLF initiatives;</li>

<li>announce upcoming Forums and other events that are open to
staff at DLF institutions; and</li>

<li>provide an outlet for information that may be of general
interest to those involved in the development and maintenance of
digital library service environments that is periodically brought
to the attention of the DLF Secretariat by staff at member
institutions, by DLF Advisory Groups and Task Forces, or by
organizations and individuals outside the DLF.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Electronic mailing lists serving specific communities within
the DLF (typically created on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and
maintained only so long as they remained useful to their members)
and permitting:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>appropriate and necessary exchange between members of the DLF
Executive Committee, its Advisory Groups, and its Task Forces;
and</li>

<li>information sharing among professional staff working in
common areas and interested in focused discussion about issues
arising from their work within those areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>A publicly accessible Web site As the principal means of
publication the Web site should provide access to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>information about the DLF, its aims, objectives, and
program;</li>

<li>information about its members including any aspects of their
digital library that they wish to emphasize through the DLF;
and</li>

<li>the publications, reports, tools and other outputs that
result from DLF initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A Web site restricted to staff at DLF member institutions As
the principal means of communicating between and facilitating
information exchange among the DLF's organizational bodies and
its members, and of developing an organizational transaction
archive the site should supply:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>regular updates about work underway in the DLF program areas
including progress reports, working papers, etc.;</li>

<li>the transaction record of the DLF including agenda,
supporting papers, and minutes associated with formal meetings of
the Executive Committee, Advisory Groups, and Task Forces;
and</li>

<li>any Digital Library Resources Reference Database that may be
constructed (see <a href="#sec326">Section 3.2.6.</a>
below).</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>DLF publications 

<p><b><i>a). Framing the Digital Library</i></b>. A comprehensive
"publication series" would serve as the principal means for
disseminating the results of work conducted in DLF program areas.
The series may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum-level content and systems preferences with
implementation guidelines that may inform their local application
and use (<a href="#sec21">Section 2.1.</a>);</li>

<li>Outline collection development strategies including
implementation guidelines and decision tools that inform local
application and use (<a href="#sec22">Section 2.2.</a>)</li>

<li>Recommended practices pertaining to copyright clearance, fair
use and other rights and licensing issues as developed conjointly
with publishing and academic professional organizations (<a
href="#sec22">Section 2.2.</a>);</li>

<li>Cost-benefit analyses of alternative business models that may
be adopted to sustain specific digital collections including any
associated market research data and their analysis (<a
href="#sec22">Section 2.2.</a>);</li>

<li>Evaluation of the potential and costs involved with new and
promising digital library technologies including guidelines and
decision trees that may inform their local assessment (<a
href="#sec23">Section 2.3.</a>);</li>

<li>Brief synopses of the potential strengths, weaknesses, and
potential costs Of implementing new technologies in local digital
library service environments (<a href="#sec23">Section
2.3.</a>);</li>

<li>Open reference source code developed for digital library
applications (<a href="#sec23">Section 2.3.</a>);</li>

<li>Information about proven quantitative and qualitative methods
for assessing the online information requirements, behaviors, and
preferences of targeted user communities including application
guidelines that may inform local use (<a href="#sec24">Section
2.4.</a>);</li>

<li>Substantive publications resulting from user needs' studies
(<a href="#sec24">Section 2.4.</a>);</li>

<li>Information about services, tools, organizational and
business mechanisms, and training and other related materials
that promise to enhance and extend user support services offered
by the digital library (<a href="#sec26">Section 2.6.</a>);
and</li>

<li>Policy and position papers enhancing our understanding of the
library's roles and responsibilities in a network space, and
providing a touch-stone for technical, strategic, and other
digital library development work (<a href="#sec24">Section
2.4.</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>2. A DLF Newsletter</i></b>. A regular Web-based
publication targeting a general audience but focusing on
professional staff within member institutions, and providing a
brief synopsis of recent DLF activities, publications, etc. with
pointers to more detailed information where it exists (e.g., on
the public or restricted Web sites). A newsletter would benefit
enormously from contributions by staff at DLF member
institutions, either to promote new digital library services and
projects, or to address technical, organizational, business, and
other challenges. A newsletter might also provide a vehicle
through which the membership could advertise and promote any
forthcoming public events that may prove of interest to those
involved with digital libraries</p>

<p><b><i>c). DLF Annual Reports</i></b>. Important for the
purposes of accountability, annual reports can also serve useful
promotional functions</p>

<p><b><i>d). Printed publicity materials</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li>General publicity literature. Targeting general audiences,
and disseminated at digital library events hosted by the DLF or
its members, and via other means, this literature would highlight
the aims and objectives of the DLF as a whole. It would also
promote the efforts at each of its member sites. A publicity pack
might, for example, enclose single-page leaflets prepared
according to a common template but promoting members' distinctive
digital library aims, objectives, and achievements).</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Targeted publicity literature. Targeting specific audiences
or focusing on particular DLF projects or program areas, this
literature might promote and advance specific causes as may be
appropriate to the aims of the DLF.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="sec326" name="sec326"></a>Digital library resources
reference database DLF members want access to digital library
expertise and experience. Although there is a marked preference
for information that is synthesized and critically evaluated, and
thus for the kinds of outputs intended for the Framing the
Digital Library publications series, there may be a residual role
for some broader resources reference database. Such a database
may also evolve as a powerful promotional tool with which members
can target highly selected communities to announce, advertise, or
seek involvement in their development of new publications,
services, or products. 

<p>The costs involved in developing such a database should not be
under-estimated, particularly as they will drain effort away from
the production of the more desirable publications series
referenced above. Accordingly, an incremental approach is
advised, one that concentrates initially on sources within DLF
member institutions. Categories of information that may be
included alongside an indication of how such information may be
developed and maintained are given below.</p>

<p>Information that may be developed and maintained by the DLF
Secretariat (in some cases with input from the membership)
include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>membership lists of DLF committees, advisory groups, and task
forces</li>

<li>a DLF mailing list, including contact details for individuals
who attend digital library events sponsored by the DLF or its
member organizations or who regularly receive electronic or
printed publications that are produced by the DLF or its member
institutions</li>

<li>a directory of key stakeholders, listing strategically
located organizations (and individual contacts within) that are
not DLF members, such as funding agencies, government
departments, library organizations, and professional societies;
and</li>

<li>a directory of electronic mailing lists deemed effective in
reaching communities with a specific interest in digital library
developments</li>
</ul>

<p>Information that may be developed and maintained by member
institutions (in many cases, information could be entered or
mounted by the Secretariat but the member institutions would be
responsible for supplying and amending such information:</p>

<ul>
<li>a DLF directory - names, job titles, contact details.
Professional staff at DLF member institutions who are willing to
supply their names for such a directory could also provide brief
descriptions of their digital library expertise and
interest;</li>

<li>a directory of DLF digital library projects - giving brief
details about digital library projects (including contact
details) at DLF member institutions; and</li>

<li>digital library gray literature (suitably revised for more
public presentation), including digital library development and
other strategy documents prepared to guide local digital library
developments; applications for external funding as sought to
support digital library research, development etc.; periodic and
summative reports produced by digital library research,
development, and other projects and initiatives whether submitted
to external funding agencies, local policy or legislative bodies,
etc.; working papers, reports, etc. produced and disseminated
locally to progress various aspects of members' digital library
programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Information exchange among the membership Members
consistently express a Desire to know more about relevant
developments across the DLF and a willingness to supply
information about local developments as part of some exchange.
Recommendations pertaining to the Digital Library Resources
Reference Database arise out of these related interests. Such an
exchange would also substantially enhance the work of the
Executive Committee, the Program Advisory Groups, the Task
Forces, and the Secretariat, ensuring it was well informed by and
appropriately responsive to members' needs, interests, and
capacities. Facilitating that exchange and, indeed, populating
the Reference Database are the key challenges. It is accordingly
recommended that DLF members prepare and submit a regular brief
report on local activities following a template that is developed
to minimize effort in compiling that report while maximizing its
usefulness and impact.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="sec33" name="sec33"></a>3.3. Resources</h3>

Table 1 provides a budget estimate for the DLF for the time
remaining in the member's original commitment to the organization
(through financial year 2001/2; that is, to June 2002). The
estimates include: 

<ul>
<li>unspent funds already accrued through members' subscription
and capital contributions; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>subscription and capital contributions yet to be collected by
the DLF (and amounting to $521,000 in each financial year
2000/2001 and 2001/2002).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Table 1. Draft outline budget for the DLF, 1 July 2000 - 30
June 2002</b></p>

<p>The table assumes no change in the DLF's membership or in the
capital and subscription costs charged to participating
members.</p>

<p>In developing the model, the following principals have been
applied:</p>

<ul>
<li>Funds should be allocated to maintain the DLF Secretariat and
to encourage and reflect activity within the program areas. In
this respect, funding should be allocated by the Executive
Committee to the DLF Secretariat and to the Program Advisory
Groups. It is anticipated that all funds will be managed by CLIR
however they are allocated.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The funding allocation to the Secretariat needs to reflect
its role in providing a catalytic and supporting infrastructure
that benefits the membership by helping it to articulate and
achieve its programmatic aims and objectives.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The funding allocation to the Program Advisory Groups needs
to reflect their role in developing and implementing the DLF's
programmatic objectives.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The funding model must be opportunistic, allowing and
encouraging the DLF Secretariat and the Program Advisory Groups
to take advantage of and develop external funding
opportunities.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The funding model must recognize the DLF's dependence on
highly motivated, well qualified, appropriately experienced,
senior professionals who are capable of taking up the catalytic
and facilitating roles envisaged for the DLF Secretariat and the
chairs of its Program Advisory Groups and Task Forces. It must
permit the DLF Secretariat and Program Advisory Boards to take
any opportunities that arise to release, second, or otherwise
co-opt such professionals who are capable of taking up and being
effective in these various roles.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The funding model must finally permit a degree of flexibility
and in this respect enable the DLF to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>alter the pattern and distribution of funding across its
program areas; and</li>

<li>add or subtract programs or increase or diminish the
allocation of funding to existing programs in response to
perceived needs, external funding opportunities, and such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Funds allocated to the DLF Secretariat The costs estimated in
Table 1 provide for Secretariat staff not tied directly to any
Program Advisory Group. The principal costs are those associated
with personnel, notably a Director, a Communications Officer, and
an Administrative Officer. Additional staff support will be
available and organizationally and functionally responsible to
the Secretariat but paid for out of budgets allocated by the
Executive Committee to the Program Advisory Groups.[<a
href="#fn4">4</a>]</li>

<li>Funds allocated to Program Advisory Groups The Executive
Committee should allocate funds for the Program Advisory Groups
on the basis of bids submitted annually to the Committee. The
bids should at a minimum provide for the following:

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>the salary, travel, equipment, and office costs associated
with that person or part of a person who is organizationally and
functionally responsible to the DLF Secretariat as outlined
above. Until June 2001 at least, these functions will be supplied
by an existing member of Secretariat staff and paid for with
contributions from the Program Advisory Group's budget
allocation.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>any remuneration and travel or other support that the Group
may wish to allocate to its chair (within general broad
guidelines established by the Executive Committee); and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>any remuneration and travel or other support that the Group
may wish to allocate to Task Force chairs (within general broad
guidelines established by the Executive Committee).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Executive Committee should only in exceptional
circumstances approve funds requested by Program Advisory Groups
for:</p>

<ul>
<li>travel costs and associated expenses incurred by staff of DLF
member institutions who serve on the Advisory Group or its Task
Forces;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>funding for capital, equipment, and other project costs
associated with specific initiatives undertaken by the Task
Forces; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>funding for activities that would normally be associated with
the work of the DLF Secretariat or the member of the Program
Advisory Group undertaking functions on behalf of the Secretariat
(e.g. administrative support, evaluation, assessment,
documentation, dissemination, business development, and other
fund-raising activities)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above constraints are recommended owing to:</p>

<ul>
<li>The limited size of the DLF's operating budget. A total of
only about $550,000 <i>per annum</i> is available for
distribution by the Program Advisory Groups and it is assumed,
moreover, that the membership will wish to proceed in 3 or 4
program areas.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF reliance upon the efforts of small, highly motivated
groups of equally expert individuals for whom well facilitated
collaboration offers a cost-effective and productive approach to
the challenges they are confronting directly and probably in
isolation at their own institutions. Funded participation in
collaborative initiatives is likely to be differently motivated
than is the participation of equally co-investing partners.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF's reliance upon its members' willingness to support
its initiatives as a crucial measure of the perceived importance
of those initiatives.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>The pressing need for the DLF to invest more than it has in
programmatically integrating its various initiatives and in
ensuring that those initiatives are properly evaluated, assessed
and documented so as to enhance their impact and influence.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within and in light of these constraints, Program Advisory
Groups should be encouraged to think creatively about developing
and providing the necessary resources to their programs. They
should be encouraged to take advantage of local opportunities to
raise funds and to economize wherever possible (e.g., by
combining in the same person the roles and responsibilities
associated with the chair and the individual responsible to the
DLF Secretariat; by seeking input from Advisory Group and Task
Force chairs from appropriately qualified professionals acting on
sabbaticals, engaged in fellowship programs, or acting on the
bases of releases supported by their host institutions).</p>
</li>

<li>External funding for specific DLF initiatives Program
Advisory Groups and Task Forces should be encouraged to enlist
the DLF's name and the associated reputation of its members to
seek external funding for their efforts. To ensure some
consistency of approach across program areas and some
transparency in any decisions taken to seek external funding, the
following guidelines are proposed:

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The DLF may endorse or play a part in applications for
external funding that: 

<ul>
<li>promise demonstrably to advance the aims and objectives that
are established and agreed to in any of its program areas;
and</li>

<li>are fundamentally and meaningfully collaborative and include
at least two DLF member institutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In contributing to any funding proposals, the DLF may draw on
its developing infrastructure and expertise in any combination of
the following ways and help proposed initiatives to: 

<ul>
<li>meaningfully, and successfuly collaborate;</li>

<li>work within and contribute to the development of a clearly
articulated program (the DLF program) designed to enable
educational and cultural organizations to take fuller and cost
effective advantage of digital resources and information
technologies;</li>

<li>evaluate and assess themselves and be evaluated and assessed
in the context of a larger group (the DLF) and in this respect to
achieve a measure of community validation;</li>

<li>document any learning and other outcomes, whether derived
from the initiative or from its evaluation or assessment, and
circulate this document to a broader community; and</li>

<li>promote outcomes that can be generalized to a broader
community not by their owners or originators, but by an objective
third party speaking on behalf of a range of similarly poised and
invested institutions.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Any contributions supplied by the DLF through its Secretariat
or through those taking up the role of the Secretariat within an
Advisory Group (whether in project co-ordination, formal
evaluation and assessment, documentation, or dissemination)
should be supplied on a cost-recovery basis.

<p></p>
</li>

<li>Funds resulting from successful grant applications should
reside with an institution that is responsible for the grant
application and not with CLIR (as host for the DLF).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>External and additional funding for the DLF program The DLF's
program objectives are not uniquely of interest to its members.
Rather they promise to supply tools and strategies that will have
direct benefit to others who seek educational, cultural, or
commercial advantage in digital information and network
technologies. There may be particular interest among:

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Professional curatorial organizations and associations
including regional and other consortia of universities,
libraries, museums, and archives who share or are beginning to
take a strategic interest in research and development agenda
which complement that established for the DLF, and may seek to
lever complementary investments through some contribution to the
DLF;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>philanthropic, government, and other funding agencies that
invest in the creation of digital resources and may have a vested
interest in the standards, strategies and tools recommended by
the DLF that promise to enhance return on that investment by
helping to ensure the usefulness and longevity of those
resources; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>commercial content suppliers which may have an interest in
similar standards, strategies, and tools, but also in any
research conducted by the DLF into users' information
requirements and online behaviors, into business models
appropriate to sustaining digital collections, and into rights,
licensing and other issues that may act as impediments to
extending their market share</li>
</ul>

<p>The DLF Secretariat, supported by the Executive Committee and
the Directors of member institutions, should accordingly be
encouraged to identify and develop opportunities to enhance core
programmatic funding, that is, funding that supports or enhances
activities across a range of existing program areas, launches
work in new program areas for which there is no available budget
allocation, or enhances the contributions that can be made by the
Secretariat to the membership as a whole (e.g. any additional or
external funding that may be acquired to mount a printed
publications program). Any funds resulting from successful grant
applications made under this head should be managed by CLIR as
host for the DLF.</p>
</li>

<li>The DLF membership Core programmatic funding available to the
DLF is also available through members' subscriptions and capital
contributions. Given the ambitious aims of the DLF's program and
the scarcity of funds available to achieve them, the DLF, through
its Executive Committee should establish, agree to, and announce
a membership policy, including:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>rates at which subscription fees and capital contributions
may be charged;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>criteria against which membership claims may be evaluated and
acted upon; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>transparent processes through which applications from any new
members may be sought, considered, and acted upon.</li>
</ul>

<p>In developing such a policy the DLF should consider the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are five organizations with a known interest in
becoming members of the DLF and together representing a potential
annual capital injection worth $120,000;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Given the DLF's current fee structure, the number of
potential new members in the DLF is likely to be small and to
decline over time;</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Any potential new members should be evaluated exclusively
with respect to their ability to benefit from and contribute to
the DLF's stated aims, objectives, and its program. In these
regards, they should:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>be committed to the development of a digital library service
environment and host appropriately skilled professional staff
able to deliver upon that commitment;</li>

<li>be positioned to enhance tangibly the efforts, credibility,
influence, or impacts associated with the work emanating from the
DLF's program; and</li>

<li>be able not only to endorse the DLF's program but also to
supply a rational for doing so that is based in local
institutional aims and objectives.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
</li>

<li>The DLF's agility in confronting the most challenging
research, development, and strategic issues is and is likely to
remain more a function of its organization and mission than of
its size.</li>
</ul>

<p>In developing a membership policy, the Executive Committee
might also wish to consider that under the recommendations made
in this business plan, the only benefits available to the DLF's
current members that are unavailable to non-members are:</p>

<ul>
<li>an ability to influence the program's aims, objectives, and
practical direction; and</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>access to materials that are available from the DLF's Web
site but restricted to members only (e.g. the DLF's transaction
record and progress reports and any digital library resources
database that may be constructed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="sec4" name="sec4"></a>4. Recommended next steps</h2>

The next steps recommend a developmental trajectory for the DLF
for the period March 2000 - June 2002. Although appropriate to
the program outlined in this document, they may also be
generalized. As such, their presence here is not intended to
pre-empt any discussion of this document or to forestall any
effort to seek revision and amendment, however substantive, to
it. 

<p>A three-phased approach is recommended to the DLF's
development to June 2002:</p>

<ul>
<li>a brief and aggressive re-organizational phase during which
essential organizational and communications mechanisms and
processes are put into place;</li>

<li>a longer developmental phase during which the emphasis shifts
to a few highly focused and practical research and development
initiatives and their assessment, documentation, and
dissemination; and</li>

<li>an evaluative phase during which the DLF as a whole is
independently and formally evaluated to supply the membership
with the data and the recommendations it will in any discussion
about whether and how to continue the DLF.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.1. Phase 1 (April-June 2000). Reorganization</h3>

Assuming agreement on the broad recommendations that are
presented in this plan, about the program areas that should be
selected for early progress, and some putative agreement
pertaining to the allocation of DLF funding across program areas,
the DLF would seek through its Secretariat to: 

<ol>
<li>Prepare draft remits and broad template guidelines to frame
the work of the Executive Committee, the Program Advisory Groups,
and the Task Forces.</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Establish and convene the Executive Committee to:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>

<p><a id="fn4" name="fn4">4.</a> Estimates shown in Table 1
include a small contingency that may be expended principally on
the development of printed publicity materials. They exclude any
allocation for other printed publications. At present, the DLF
spends approximately $3,000 per printed publication (including
editorial, production, and dissemination costs). These typically
run to 45 pages (8.5"x11" format) and have a print run of about
300. The printed publications are valuable informational and
promotional materials. Yet it is not clear at this stage that
their value outweighs their costs, particularly as the Web
provides an alternative and much more affordable means of
distribution. Although the DLF should seek to maintain a printed
publications program, it is recommended that it do so by seeking
a publishing partner able and willing to bear the production and
distribution costs, by seeking external funding capable of
supporting a publications program, or by some combination of
these methods.</p>
