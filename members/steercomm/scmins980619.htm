<h2>DLF Steering Committee</h2>

<p><b>Minutes of meeting on June 19, 1998</b></p>

<p></p>

<p><b>Present:</b> Scott Bennett (Yale), Liz Bishoff (OCLC, for
Donald Muccino), L. Reynolds Cahoon (NARA), Jerry Campbell (USC),
Nancy Cline (Harvard), Nancy Eaton (Penn State), William Gosling
(Michigan), Martin Halbert (Emory, for Joan Gotwals), Paula
Kaufman (Tennessee), Richard Lucier (CDL), Deanna Marcum (CLIR),
Assunta Pisani (Stanford, for Michael Keller), Patricia Renfro
(Penn, for Paul Mosher), Sue Rosenblatt (UC Berkeley, for Peter
Lyman), Martin Runkle (Chicago), Gloriana St. Clair (Carnegie
Mellon), Elaine Sloan (Columbia), Winston Tabb (LC), Sarah Thomas
(Cornell), Suzanne Thorin (Indiana), William Walker (NYPL),
Donald Waters (DLF), Linda West (RLG, for James Michalko)</p>

<p><b>Unable to attend:</b> Susan Nutter (NC State), Tom
Shaughnessy (Minnesota), Karin Trainer (Princeton)</p>

<p><b>Guests:</b> Ann Okerson (Yale)</p>

<p>Sarah Thomas, chair, convened the meeting at 10:00 a.m.
Participants introduced themselves. Minutes of the last meeting
were approved as written, and dates for upcoming meetings were
approved (October 2, 1998; March 19, 1999; June 18, 1999).</p>

<p>Thomas welcomed the new partners - California Digital Library,
University of Chicago, North Carolina State, and Carnegie Mellon
- in the Federation.</p>

<p><b>Review of DLF activities.</b> Don Waters highlighted
Federation activities since the last meeting. He especially noted
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first draft of the white paper on the Making of America
project, which is receiving good feedback from the computer
science community;</li>

<li>The CIC authorization project, which is moving along to a
first phase deadline early in September;</li>

<li>The draft report, composed by Caroline Arms, on the access
management workshop held in April. The report makes an important
distinction between access and use; where management of access
cannot reliably predict and may inappropriately constrain uses of
information, especially in teaching and research contexts;</li>

<li>The development of the workshop scheduled for June 30 on
editorial practices of electronic text centers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Waters indicated that he had submitted a proposal on behalf of
the DLF to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)
for funding for the Social Science Databases project and the
Making of America, Part III. He also submitted a letter of intent
to submit a proposal in the Digital Library Initiative grant
program to study naming of works in multiple repositories. He has
postponed submitting the proposal until the next round of
grants.</p>

<p>In discussing organizational issues, Waters announced that the
National Archives wishes to be an ally, not a partner, in the
Federation. Projects of interest to the archival community will
be sought in the coming months in which to involve NARA.</p>

<p>Waters' highest immediate priority is to fill the research
associate position. Several candidates have been interviewed, but
the search has not been successful.</p>

<p>Waters asked for the participants' views on the external
review panel. He reminded the group that the panel is to be made
up of individuals from outside the Federation with an interest
and expertise to assess the work of the DLF once a year. The
panel will review plans and help with "out-of-the-box" thinking.
More than a dozen names were suggested, and it was decided that
Waters will send an e-mail message to the partners reminding them
of the need to think about faculty or others not usually listed
for this assignment. Waters will then name a subcommittee of
three or four Steering Committee members to make the final
determination of the panel's composition.</p>

<p>Waters announced that the DLF Web site is now part of CLIR's
website. Older material that has been maintained by the Library
of Congress on its Web site will be archived. He also noted that
a brochure to be used in fund-raising for DLF is being
developed.</p>

<p>Scott Bennett urged that DLF begin to pursue non-library
members. He encouraged Waters to make preliminary inquiries about
the level of interest among the publishing and technology
communities, in particular.</p>

<p>Bill Gosling encouraged Waters to communicate more detailed
information to levels of staff beyond the director level.</p>

<p>Moving to a discussion of work to be undertaken, Waters cited
the need to draw together the work that has been done by the
architecture committee and to make it more widely available. He
is thinking about commissioning a paper on digital library
architecture, and asked the group for their thoughts about this.
There was general agreement that such a paper would be
helpful.</p>

<p>Bill Walker described a meeting recently held in Paris that
was co-sponsored by the Bibliotheque nationale de France and the
New York Public Library to discuss digital library initiatives.
It was suggested that the Europeans consider forming a "European
Digital Library Federation" as a body to continue discussions
with the American counterpart, the Digital Library Federation. In
discussing how to proceed, Gosling suggested that DLF serve an
information clearinghouse function, so that all will be better
informed about what is happening in other parts of the world.
Richard Lucier cautioned that our need for international
involvement is not limited to Europe. We need to be looking to
the Pacific Rim and south of the border, as well. Bennett agreed
that staying alert to opportunities for international
collaboration is important, but cautioned that discussion of such
opportunities should not be allowed to impede progress on the
ambitious program of projects that the DLF has set for
itself.</p>

<p>In summarizing the prospective list of projects, Waters
emphasized that projects can move forward only where there is
leadership from member institutions. To make progress in finding
the appropriate relationship with the developing cottage
industries, Deanna Marcum suggested bringing one or two scholars
engaged in solitary digital projects to the next meeting of the
Steering Committee to discuss what would be involved in
connecting their projects to institutionalized digital libraries.
Liz Bishoff urged that users of the cottage industry products be
brought into the discussion as well.</p>

<p><b>Intellectual property policies.</b> Turning to the campus
initiatives related to copyright, there were brief presentations
from Stanford, the University of California, Yale, Columbia, the
University of Southern California, and Indiana University.</p>

<p>The group adjourned for lunch, and reconvened to discuss
licensing issues.</p>

<p><b>Models for inter-institutional licensing.</b> Waters
referred to the position paper he prepared for the meeting in
which he suggests that the Steering Committee should consider
licensing as a strategic tool for digital libraries in making
materials available to their readers. Licensing those materials
would enable libraries to clearly articulate the value of their
digital materials, and to define the conditions for high quality
services to readers. Libraries have learned in their licensing
arrangements with publishers that such features are essential for
a robust development of digital materials. By developing models
for inter-institutional licensing arrangements, the DLF might
apply what institutions have learned in their relationships with
publishers. Such models could serve as a foundation for enhancing
the development of digital libraries and positioning them
strategically to deal with changes in scholarly communication
prompted by changes in institutional copyright policies.</p>

<p>Ann Okerson was to have led the Steering Committee in a
discussion of inter-institutional licensing, but the schedule had
to be modified because her plane was delayed. Waters read from
some of Okerson's preliminary notes for her presentation and
described five potential licensing environments for DLF to
consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>No agreement or license is needed; material is freely
available and widely distributed</li>

<li>Unfettered distribution within membership; no conditions for
use within DLF, but conditions apply for those not in the
Federation</li>

<li>Trading partners within membership; an interlibrary loan
model applies with tiered arrangements within DLF and higher
costs and additional conditions outside the Federation</li>

<li>Costs recovered from and conditions imposed on all readers,
regardless of the institution</li>

<li>Costs recovered from libraries and conditions imposed on
readers via their association with the library; higher costs and
additional conditions would apply for readers not associated with
a library</li>
</ol>

<p>Again reading from Okerson's preliminary notes, Waters cited
factors that would lead to freer, unrestricted access, such as
the small, intimate nature of the group and shared values about
disseminating information. Factors that would lead to more
controlled access include the need for income to pay for the
support of the site; the need for credit or attribution, and a
conviction that business-like arrangements lead to cleaner
relationships over time.</p>

<p>Nancy Cline wondered if the group could envision an umbrella
model for licensing that incorporates the many arrangements
already in effect in the member libraries. Bennett offered that
Okerson's work suggests that no single all-encompassing license
can be written. Moreover, he pointed out that she has expressed
deep puzzlement about the issue of fair use, observing that
libraries are now writing licenses that are more favorable than
the current fair use provisions available under the copyright
law. Bennett speculated that our old allegiance to fair use might
not serve us well in the digital world. He suggested that we are
witnessing a failure of the copyright regime to protect our
interests and values, and that by engaging in a contract law
environment that protects, even enhances, our traditional
values.</p>

<p>Campbell noted the universal feeling that the issues
surrounding digital ownership are complex, but essential to
solve. DLF institutions must take up the challenge of managing
the intellectual property they own. He cited the USC initiatives
to develop or secure software that is sophisticated enough to
recognize various levels of ownership as well as to recognize the
rights of different owners. Working with the individual who
created the credit card billing system for oil companies, USC has
completed functional specification for this kind of system.</p>

<p>Asunta Pisani urged the group not to abandon the struggle over
fair use. She wants to counter the publishers' assumption that
libraries are fighting this as an economic question.</p>

<p>The large group then divided into three smaller groups to
debate the resolution: That libraries, archives, and special
collections should adopt, as a matter of policy, the use of
licenses to make their digital materials available across
inter-institutional boundaries.</p>

<p>Okerson arrived as the Steering Committee reconvened from the
small group discussions. She described the differences between
copyright and licenses as legal vehicles for providing access to
materials that libraries own. She described the current practices
of managing electronic resources and emphasized that copyright
does not give any ownership rights to public domain materials.
However, an institution can assert some authority over such
materials through the use of licensing and this a critical point
for DLF institutions that are digitizing public domain
information. Okerson also described the current trends in
licensing and noting the movement toward simplification through
the development of licensing templates and frameworks. After
reviewing the varying ways that DLF institutions are serving as
creators and providers of digital resources, she observed that
they are acting more or less like publishers. She recommended the
use of copyright when it is part of the institutional mission and
when the institution wants or needs no controls in the future.
She recommended the use of licenses when income is desired or
required, a diverse, layered marketplace exists, expectations and
commitments need to be clear between the customer and provider,
and/or when relationships between creator and customer need to be
created and sustained over time.</p>

<p>Waters said that he would circulate the notes of the small
group discussions and, in consultation with members of the
Steering Committee, decide how best to move the discussions on
licensing forward.</p>

<p>With thanks to all for their participation, and to Okerson for
her persistence in reaching D.C. to attend, Thomas adjourned the
meeting at 3:00 p.m.</p>
