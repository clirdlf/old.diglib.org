<h3>Ongoing projects</h3>

<h4>The Academic Image Cooperative (AIC)</h4>

Work on the AIC prototype was sufficiently completed to support a
demonstration (very well received) to the College Art Association
on 23 February 2000. The AIC is clearly working with a compelling
model of shared collection development,  one that involves a
broad community of subject specialists and relies on voluntary
contribution of high-quality images that exist within the public
domain or are willingly made available for educational purposes
by "depositors". Another very promising aspect of the AIC is its
user orientation. Collections are designed and developed
explicitly with a well defined user community in view. In order
to ensure the project delivers maximum benefit to the DLF
members, it will be focusing from now until the end of the
funding period (May 2000) on evaluating and documenting its
collection development strategy and its associated business
potential. It will also document other more technical aspects of
its work to date including its data model and the XML-compliant
software tools that have been developed. In the course of this
work, institutional partners that make up the AIC may invite some
broader involvement in a further development phase. To date, a
total of $70,000 of DLF funds have been expended on or is
committed to the AIC, excluding the substantial contributions
made by Rebecca Graham in her role as Project Manager. No further
expenditure on the project is expected at this stage. For further
details see <a

<h4>Developing systems of authorization</h4>

Further implementation of the digital certificate prototype
system, which combines the use of X.509 digital certificates for
authentication with a directory service providing authorization
to licensed resources based on user attributes are underway at
the University of Minnesota. Minnesota is taking the lead within
the CIC with the consortium viewing this work as another
authentication and authorization implementation under the TRICAAP
initiative. 

<h4>Forum on Digital Library Practice</h4>

The spring 2000 forum, focusing on organizational and policy
issues, is being held at Emory University in Atlanta, GA from
Friday, March 31 - April 2, 2000. More than seventy-five
participants are expected from across DLF institutions where a
range of issues will be presented and discussed in an effort to
identify and inform early areas of engagement under the newly
developed business plan for the DLF. 

<h4>Guides to Quality in Visual Resource Imaging</h4>

DLF, CLIR, and RLG have created an editorial board of experts to
review the state of the art in visual resource imaging and to
identify technologies and practices that can be documented and
recommended to the community. The board has decided to focus on
documenting the science of imaging; that is, some of the
objective measures of image qualities, such as color, tone,
resolution, etc. and how they can be controlled in various
aspects of an imaging process. It has identified five areas in
which to address these issues: setting up an imaging project,
selecting a scanner, creating a scanning system, producing a
digital master, and generating digital derivatives. The first
three guides are currently undergoing markup at RLG and will be
made available in April 1999. Technical review of the remaining
two guides in the series is being completed to be returned to the
authors for final update and submission. Upon final editing these
will be forwarded to RLG for markup and availability. 

<h4>Institutional policies and practices for the long-term
maintenance of digital materials</h4>

The DLF and RLG have formed a task force to advance the
understanding of digital preservation policy and practice. The
goal of the task force is to identify and document these
practices so that DLF and RLG can identify what kinds of
technical, economic, and organizational barriers institutions are
facing, and what kinds of actions are needed to reduce those
barriers. Since the October DLF meeting participants in the three
task forces have considered the most useful form in which to
publish the results of their environmental scans for digital
archiving policy and practice statements. A draft framework was
distributed for comment in late February. Next steps involve
fleshing out the framework with extant material and mounting in
the RLG Web site as a tool for those creating institutional
policy and procedure statements. Follow-on work will fill in gaps
in the framework. 

<h4>Technical metadata elements for image files</h4>

Capitalizing on the work accomplished at the National Information
Standards Organization (NISO), Council on Library and Information
Resources (CLIR) and Research Libraries Group (RLG) workshop in
April 1999, experts have been identified to finalize a set of
elements and specified details to serve as the basis for a draft
standard. During the course of this work (targeted to be complete
by no later than June 30, 2000) the organizing committee is
identifying candidates for membership on a standards committee
who will work over the subsequent year to finalize this standard.


<h3>Prospective initiatives</h3>

<h4>Open Archives</h4>

At a meeting held in Santa Fe late last year, significant
progress was made amongst a group representing some of the
largest and most influential pre-print services on minimum level
standards that if widely adopted across pre-print services, can
help to ensure a greater degree of consistency and
interoperability. The so-called "Santa Fe Convention" was
recently released (<a
href="http://www.openarchives.org/">http://www.openarchives.org</a>)
with simultaneous publication of two companion papers in the
recent issue of D-Lib Magazine (<a
href="http://www.dlib.org/">http://www.dlib.org</a>). The Open
Archives groups also holds forth some promise in two related
areas: the development of robust and flexible reference linking
systems, and the definition of minimum level requirements for
digital archival repositories. As a consequence of these several
potential benefits, the DLF Secretariat has held discussions with
key figures within the Open Archives group about how and to what
extent it might, in partnership with other leading organizations
such as CNI and ARL/SPARC help the group to build on its early
momentum. At present, the DLF Secretariat has agreed to assist
the Open Archives group by helping it to notify the existence of
the Santa Fe Convention to the widest possible community of
pre-print services, notably by contacting those listed at <a
href="http://www.osti.gov/eprints/ppnbrowse.html">http://www.osti.gov/eprints/ppnbrowse.html</a>.


<h4>Mirror site for PADI</h4>

The National Library of Australia maintains one of the finest
sites offering searchable links to digital preservation
resources. The NLA is committed to broadening the basis of
support for <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/padi/">PADI</a> and
has established an international advisory board to this end. It
is also investigating mechanisms which will facilitate a more
internationally collaborative approach to the database's
development and maintenance. As part of this process the NLA has
had discussions with the DLF Secretariat about a possible US
mirror site for the PADI database. The Library of Congress has
offered to host the mirror and discussions are continuing. 

<h4>Reference Linking</h4>

The DLF has for some time been involved in discussions about
reference linking tools that enable users to find the appropriate
copy of a particular digital object, not necessarily the one that
happens to be served by any specific publisher or supplier. Some
very significant work has been conducted by <a
href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/Annex/pcaplan/reflink.html">Dale
Flecker and Priscilla Kaplan</a> (among others). Recently, an
opportunity arose to approach a commercial organization CrossRef,
which may have a business interest in addressing the so-called
appropriate copy problem. The DLF, along with a number of
institutions including Cornell, Harvard, Ohio State University,
University of Illinois, the University of Toronto, and Yale are
preparing a letter to CrossRef outlining the nature of the
problem and expressing an interest in some collaborative attempt
to address it. A <a href="crlet.htm">draft of the letter</a> is
available for members' information. 

<h4>Department of Energy</h4>

Walter Warnick, Director of the Office of Scientific and
Technical Information of the Department of Energy addressed the
DLF Steering Committee at its last meeting. Since then, he has
met with the DLF Director to discuss possible future developments
at the DOE which include the construction of a very ambitious
national digital library serving the broad subject domain and
building upon existing services already available from the DOE.
At least three points of potential contact between the DOE and
the DLF emerged from the discussion including: 

<ul>
<li>joint exploration of common technical interests (e.g.
reference linking, digital archiving, etc.)</li>

<li>DLF contributions to any advisory board that may be
established to assist any national digital library
initiative</li>

<li>Joint interest in assisting the Open Archives Initiative
(most pre-print services exist within subject areas that are</li>

<li>directly relevant to and supported by the DOE.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Digital Preservation</h4>

A number of meetings sponsored by CNI and CLIR were held late
last year to address problems involved in moving libraries'
engagement with digital preservation into a practical phase. One
result of the meetings was an interest to explore in a
constrained environment the organizational, technical, and
business aspects of some digital archival repository activity
within the university sector. At present, a group comprising
representatives from the CNI, CLIR, the DLF, and the Mellon
Foundation are looking to develop a program involving
organizations in the following economic roles: 

<ul>
<li>As digital archival repositories</li>

<li>As consumers of digital information with an interest in
ensuring longevity of that information</li>

<li>Suppliers/depositors of digital information with an interest
in responding to consumer demand and thereby seeking digital
archival repositories</li>
</ul>

The group is at present drafting an outline requirement for a
digital archival repository
