<h2>DLF Steering Committee</h2>

<p><b>Minutes of meeting on June 18, 1999</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Present: Scott Bennett (Yale), Harold Billings (University of
Texas),Jerry Campbell (USC), Nancy Cline (Harvard), Nancy Eaton
(Penn State), Rebecca Graham (DLF), Joan Gotwals (Emory), Bernie
Hurley (for Gerald Lowell, UC Berkeley), Paula Kaufman
(Tennessee), Michael Keller (Stanford), Wendy Lougee (for Bill
Gosling, Michigan), Richard Lucier (CDL), Clifford Lynch (CNI),
Deanna Marcum (CLIR), James Michalko (RLG), Paul Mosher (Penn),
Donald Muccino (OCLC), Susan Nutter (NC State), Gloriana St.
Clair (Carnegie Mellon), Tom Shaughnessy (Minnesota), Winston
Tabb (LC), Sarah Thomas (Cornell), Suzanne Thorin (Indiana),
<font size="3">Barbara Van Deventer</font> (for Martin Runkle,
Chicago), William Walker (NYPL), Donald Waters (DLF), <font
size="3">Robert Wolven (for</font> Elaine Sloan, (Columbia)</p>

 

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Unable to attend: L. Reynolds
Cahoon (NARA), Karin Trainer (Princeton)</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Paula Kaufman, chair, opened
the meeting at 10:00 a.m. by welcoming the participants. She
reminded the group that she will assume the position of
university librarian at the University of Illinois in August, and
since Illinois is not currently a member of DLF, she must resign
as chair of the Federation. Sarah Thomas, last year's chair, has
graciously agreed to fill the remainder of Ms. Kaufman's term
until elections can be held.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The Steering Committee agreed
to the meeting dates proposed for academic year 1999-2000:
September 24, 1999; March 17, 2000; and June 16, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Don Waters reviewed highlights
of the written report of DLF activities since the last Steering
Committee meeting. Jim Michalko, in expanding upon the report of
the task forces being established by the Research Libraries
Group, said that there are not enough DLF institutions to
populate the institutional records task force. Other institutions
are volunteering representatives for that group. Task forces will
begin their work in July.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Clifford Lynch noted that the
small groups that worked on technical metadata elements for
images in the recent workshop would soon distribute substantive
technical analyses of metadata requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Mr. Waters announced that there
would be a written report on the reference-linking workshop. He
observed that linking to resources of which there are multiple
versions remains a thorny problem, and that the National Science
Foundation has initiated international collaboration on reference
linking research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The DLF activities report
prompted a discussion of how all projects fit into a broader
framework. The members of the Steering Committee have diverse
notions about how much structure is actually needed, but the
group concluded that an annual review of DLF projects might
provide a continuing synthesis that would be quite
valuable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Mr. Waters excused himself from
the meeting while the Steering Committee discussed its
aspirations for the new director of the Federation. The group
praised Mr. Waters' wonderful combination of technical knowledge
and leadership qualities. Everyone agreed that the combination is
desirable in the next director as well. As one director
commented, "Don has provided the glue among our organizations.
That function continues to be more important than any other."
Communication skills are also extremely important in the next
director; DLF needs someone who can link to other administrative
groups, who can connect with the many academic disciplines, and
who can link all of the institutions within DLF. Mr. Lynch
commented on the productive collaboration that CNI and DLF had
developed, and all agreed that this is important to
continue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Directors suggested looking at
the former Planning Committee, at individuals abroad who are
doing work similar to DLF projects, and at the medical
informatics community for candidates to fill the position. While
all agree that the desirable educational background was not
limited to any one field, one DLF participant urged that the next
director be able to look at problems through a "librarian's
lens."</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Moving to a discussion of the
communications program of the DLF, directors recommended that
summaries of all activities be posted on the DLF Web site. They
encouraged two types of published reports--one that focuses on
broader issues that will appeal to administrators and one that
goes more deeply into technical issues. Some directors thought
DLF staff should survey the landscape and alert directors of
forthcoming trends, but others thought that this would diffuse
the DLF focus. Several directors advised DLF staff to issue more
reports that are focused on the institutional accomplishments of
member organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">All members of the Federation
were encouraged to submit names of possible candidates to Deanna
Marcum, chair of the search committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Lunch ended with a toast to Mr.
Waters, wishing him every success in his new position at The
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and an expression of gratitude to Ms.
Kaufman for her leadership of the Steering Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">In the afternoon session, David
Millman, Columbia University, presented a report on the prototype
for certificate-based authentication and authorization (see
attachment 1), followed by a report on the academic image
exchange project by Max Marmor, Yale University (see attachment
2).</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The Steering Committee
applauded the work done by these two groups, calling them the
very model of federated work they had hoped for.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Questions asked about the
certificate-based authentication and authorization work included
the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; What are the encryption
methods used?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; What amount of time is
required for the user to go through the process?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Is there an
over-emphasis on what service providers want rather than what
libraries want?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull;How are privacy issues
dealt with?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Does this require
libraries to issues certificates to every user?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; What are the technical
requirements for implementing this system?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Are administrative
software systems producers being kept informed of this
work?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Are the other models
that are under development in other countries being
considered?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The directors encouraged Mr.
Millman and the DLF staff to survey each of the DLF institutions
to determine what each is doing in this area. They also urged
that the work be made known to various licensing
consortia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The following questions were
asked about the image exchange:</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Does it make more sense
to think about distributed repositories after the prototype is
completed?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Can the scope be
broadened to include more general research needs, not just
curricular support?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Should archaeology,
architecture, and anthropology images eventually be added to the
image exchange?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; Will the project address
persistent identifier schemes as one of its
components?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">&bull; How is this project
being integrated into other DLF projects?</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Mr. Marmor indicated that the
College Art Association recently endorsed the project, and there
are many enthusiastic volunteers now at work. Mr. Waters reported
that DLF has thus far invested $25,000 in this project, but
another $50,000 will be needed to complete the prototype. All
directors indicated support for completing the
prototype.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">Written reports from three DLF
partners had been distributed prior to the meeting. Directors had
an opportunity to ask questions about the reports.</font></p>

<p><font face="Palatino" size="3">The meeting was adjourned at
3:00 p.m.</font></p>
