<p><b>Minutes of meeting on October 2, 1998</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Present: Scott Bennett (Yale), Liz Bishoff (OCLC, for Donald
Muccino), Jerry Campbell (USC), Laura Campbell (LC, for Winston
Tabb), Nancy Cline (Harvard), Rebecca Graham (DLF), Joan Gotwals
(Emory), Paula Kaufman (Tennessee), Michael Keller (Stanford),
Wendy Lougee (Michigan, for Bill Gosling), Richard Lucier (CDL),
Deanna Marcum (CLIR), Charlene Mason (Minnesota, for Tom
Shaughnessy), Paul Mosher (Penn), Susan Nutter (NC State), Sue
Rosenblatt (UC Berkeley, for Penny Abell), Martin Runkle
(Chicago), Gloriana St. Clair (Carnegie Mellon), Diana Shenk
(Penn State, for Nancy Eaton), Elaine Sloan (Columbia), Sarah
Thomas (Cornell), Suzanne Thorin (Indiana), Karin Trainer
(Princeton), William Walker (NYPL), Donald Waters (DLF), Linda
West (RLG, for James Michalko)</p>

<p>Unable to attend: L. Reynolds Cahoon (NARA)</p>

<p>Guests: Dr. Michael Kurtz, Scientist, Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sarah Thomas, chair, welcomed participants and opened the
meeting at 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Minutes of the last meeting were approved. Participants
encouraged distributing an executive summary of the minutes on
the Web.</p>

<p>Rebecca Graham, the new Research Associate, was warmly
welcomed.</p>

<p>The nominating committee submitted its recommendation that
Paula Kaufman be the next chair of the Steering Committee. Ms.
Kaufman was elected by acclamation.</p>

<p><b>Review of DLF Activities</b>. Don Waters noted that his
written report was included in the pre-meeting packet. Questions
from the group were answered. Most of the time allocated for the
activity report was spent on weighing the relative interest in
proposed activities. Several participants cited the interest of
their institutions in distance education and urged Don to pursue
this area vigorously by appointing a task force to outline
possible next steps. Michael Keller pointed out that this area is
also of great interest to the commercial sector, and he asked
that the task force should make an effort to find out if DLF
could take concerted action to make better use of its purchasing
power. Nancy Cline encouraged forming a partnership with Educause
in pursuing this subject. Jerry Campbell urged that the task
force should try to consider the entire digital learning
environment (both technology in the classroom and digital
libraries).</p>

<p>On the topics of government documents and GIS, there was also
a great deal of interest in further action. Mr. Keller noted the
DLI work at Berkeley and Santa Barbara on GIS systems that may be
useful for DLF purposes. Richard Lucier indicated that the
California Digital Library has completed prelimionary evaluations
of the usefulness of these two projects in a production
environment.. He offered to make the evaluation results available
to the DLF partners. Charlene Mason asked that a technology
specialist and a government documents specialist be engaged to
consider the next steps. Mr. Waters will ask the Steering
Committee members by e-mail for suggestions of staff to work on a
government documents project.</p>

<p>Mr. Waters described his site visit to Carnegie-Mellon
University, and noted the interesting work that has been
completed recently by John Ockerbloom on agent-based architecture
for digital file conversion and migration. The Steering Committee
was enthusiastic about pursuing Ockerbloom's idea more fully for
DLF purposes. Some members wondered if we should not also
consider the JSTOR model for managing electronic journals at the
same time. Wendy Lougee conveyed the importance of a concurrent
discussion about how we share middleware.</p>

<p>Ms. Rosenblatt volunteered that MOA III as it has been
discussed by several DLF members is a project involving archiving
strategies, particularly migration. Mr. Waters observed that
events are already overtaking that aspect of the project. Library
of Congress, Michigan, and others are already collaborating to
migrate digitized materials from obsolete and inaccessible
systems into more accessible formats.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucier observed that archiving is a core issue for DLF
participants. It is this question that raises very serious doubts
about digital libraries among faculty. Martin Runkle suggested
that the phrase "long term maintenance" be substituted for
digital archiving in order to attract administrators' attention.
He reminded the group that long term maintenance of digital files
is critically important to all institutions. He recommended that
DLF conduct a financial analysis of a service we could offer
collectively, possibly using the Center for Research Libraries
model. Mr. Keller summarized the discussion by observing that the
institutions represented in the DLF are perhaps uniquely
positioned to bring the necessary resources to bear to solve the
digital archiving problem. There was general agreement that DLF
should take this issue as a matter of urgent priority and make a
visible, public commitment to progress in various settings and
ways.</p>

<p>With all of the possible activities being important, what are
the core activities for the next year, the group asked. Mr.
Waters was asked to present a plan for DLF-defined service by the
next meeting of the Steering Committee. Scott Bennett suggested
that all of our institutions are currently spending millions of
dollars on data conversion activities, even though they it is not
always clear how the work advances the mission of the libraries
involved. DLF should seek to help tie the business plans for data
conversion activities to the general business plan for the
libraries.</p>

<p>When asked what he felt the other priorities are of DLF, Mr.
Waters responded with four: archiving (or "long-term
maintenance"), authorization, metadata, and discovery and
retrieval services.</p>

<p><b>News from DLF Partners.</b> Half of the DLF partners had an
opportunity to describe current digital library initiatives that
were underway in their institutions. Those who had submitted DLI
2 proposals to the National Science Foundation briefly described
them.</p>

<p><b>Framework for Managing Digital Information.</b> A paper by
Rodney Stenlake describing a framework for libraries to license
digital material that they own in their collections was discussed
by the Steering Committee. The group concluded that the paper did
not advance the collective thinking very much. Several possible
approaches were offered, but the conclusion was it is too early
to tackle this questions of licenses among member
institutions.</p>

<p><b>Scholar-driven information systems</b>. After a lunch
break, the group reassembled to hear a presentation from Dr.
Michael Kurtz, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics. Dr. Kurtz described the center's efforts to create
the Astrophysics Data System, beginning in 1990. He characterized
the most important features of the data center as:</p>

<p>ADS is an international discipline-wide collaboration.</p>

<p>ADS personnel are experts in astronomy.</p>

<p>ADS was designed to work for end-users who are professional
astronomers, not for the casually interested. Astronomers are the
users of the service.</p>

<p>All ADS use is desktop use.</p>

<p>All astronomical research journals send their tables of
contents to ADS. Seven of the eight most important journals
provide online text in HTML. ADS has copyright permission from
all of the journal publishers to scan the historical in-print
literature into the database. In the future, the ADS plans to
scan all journals to volume one. A grant from NEH is allowing ADS
to work with the Harvard preservation staff to microfilm the
volumes, and scanning will be done from the microfilm. Indexing
will be done later as money is available. The ADS has been able
to accomplish this largely because the scholarly societies in
astrophysics own the materials and are willing to provide rights
to include them in the database.</p>

<p>After discussing the implications of these scholar-driven
information systems, the DLF Steering Committee adjourned. The
next meeting is scheduled for March 19,1999.</p>
