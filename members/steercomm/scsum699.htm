<p><b>Academic Image Exchange</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>In January, DLF convened a meeting to explore ways of using
digital libraries to enhance the quality of art history teaching
and research in the nation's colleges and universities. Art
history faculty, visual resources librarians, and representatives
of the College Art Association participated in the meeting.
Participants are now proceeding with the development of prototype
mechanism, called an image exchange. The facility would enable
scholars to share with each other images, to which they own the
rights, of works needed for teaching and research. Since March,
participants in the projects have opened discussions of the
development of the image exchange through formal presentations at
the CNI spring meeting (see Part G) and at a regional meeting of
the Visual Resources Association, and through a variety of
informal presentations with interested organizations such as
AMICO and art history publishers. In addition, DLF contracted
with Robert Baron, an independent art historian and consultant
with expertise in information technology and intellectual
property matters, to serve as project manager. The Image Exchange
organizing group met at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh
on May 22-23 to design and to begin constructing the prototype
system. With the help of CMU computer scientists, the group
settled on a comprehensive set of features for the Exchange (see
Part H). It is now at work developing a set of these features,
including a concordance of images in key art and architectural
history textbooks, to comprise the prototype Image Exchange.
Details of funding models for the Exchange are being fleshed out,
a planning grant proposal for approximately $50,000 is being
prepared to cover costs of the prototype development, and a
generic grant proposal is being outlined to support the full
development of the Exchange.</p>

<p><b>Social Science Data Archives Workshop</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>Susan Rosenblatt submitted a full report of the proceedings of
the workshop held in January (see
http://www.diglib.org/ssdaresults.htm). From the proceedings of
the workshop, the report identifies a rich agenda for action
including the following, which deserve the attention of DLF, its
partners, and allies:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<ul>
<li>The use of numeric data in the social science curriculum
appears to be expanding rapidly. This expansion draws attention
to the limited availability of much-needed resources, including
skilled staff and the infrastructure to disseminate SGML and XML
encoded documentation. It requires library and other
institutional leaders to be better informed about quantitative
service needs, and it demands careful strategic planning for
research and pedagogical needs within and across
disciplines.</li>

<li>Independent, uncoordinated, and duplicative work is underway
on nearly every campus developing and deploying easy to use
mechanisms for faculty and students to use key datasets. Faculty
participants emphasized that these access mechanisms must be
designed to enable scientific replication of data analysis.
Workshop participants held out the possibility that a centrally
administered master plan could be devised for systematically
dividing the labor of developing access tools among a variety of
campuses. Gary King of Harvard University offered a different and
compelling model of cooperation based on contributions of work in
a common but distributed framework of data repositories and
tools, which he calls the Virtual Data Center.</li>

<li>The development and deployment of a new SGML-based standard
for documenting datasets in codebooks will require campus
investments, offer opportunities for converting existing
codebooks to digital form, and create the need for research to
understand how online codebooks will relate to other discovery
and access tools for numeric data.</li>

<li>Preservation strategies are needed to address the
deterioration of codebooks and the dissemination of data products
that bundle together and tightly integrate data and the tools for
extracting and analyzing them.</li>

<li>Tools and other facilities are needed to help users
understand and deal with comparability across related
datasets.</li>

<li>Cataloging of datasets has been sorely neglected.</li>

<li>There is an opportunity for the development of consortia (or
the use of existing consortia) to negotiate the purchase and
licensing of critical and expensive datasets.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Invitational workshop on technical metadata elements for
image files</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>The National Information Standards Organization (NISO), the
Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and the
Research Libraries Group (RLG) sponsored an invitational workshop
on April 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> in Washington DC.
The purpose of the workshop was to examine technical information
needed to manage and use digital still images that reproduce a
variety of pictures, documents and artifacts. Donald Waters was
on the organizing committee for the workshop. Sixty individuals
with a wide range of diverse interests and perspectives on the
problem of metadata information attended the meeting. DLF partner
and allied institutions were well represented among the
attendees, who included libraries, universities, museums,
archives, the digital library community, the government, and the
digital imaging vendor community.</p>

<p>The meeting was facilitated by Jennifer Trant of the Art
Museum Image Consortium. Howard Besser, a member of the
organizing committee, delivered the keynote remarks and was
followed by speakers who reported on metadata initiatives at the
Library of Congress, the Research Libraries Group, the Art Museum
Image Consortium, and the Making of America II project. In the
deliberations that followed, the participants reached agreement
on a variety of issues including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a preliminary list of technical metadata elements</li>

<li>the use of industry standard metrics, where they exist, for
assessing images (for example, tone, color, ICC profiles)</li>

<li>the need to develop methods of pointing at external test
charts</li>

<li>a requirement for mechanisms enabling the metadata associated
with an image to persist through various transformations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Developing systems of authorization</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>Under DLF auspices, the University of California, Columbia
University, JSTOR, and OCLC are developing a protocol that will
enable an information resource provider to verify that a user
bearing a digital certificate has authority from a home
institution to use a requested resource. The prototype system
being developed combines the use of X.509 digital certificates
for authentication with a directory service providing
authorization to licensed resources based on user attributes. The
first phase of work on the project was presented at the CNI
Spring Meeting in Washington, D.C. in April of this year (see
Part F). Just after CNI, project participants met and outlined a
work plan for a second phase of development work.</p>

<p>The group focused on the need to recruit additional
participants for further testing and development of the protocol.
They devised a strategy to engage additional campus participants
by aiming not only at library needs but also at campus technology
organizations. The use of digital certificates is becoming part
of campus technology infrastructure generally as a secure means
for authorization to a range of campus systems and resources. DLF
is therefore working in conjunction with CREN to develop a paper
of frequently asked questions and answers about the use of
digital certificates that will be targeted generally to senior
campus administrators. In addition, project participants
presented the project to the IT directors attending the spring
meeting of the Common Solutions Group. In early June, project
members also attended a meeting of the CIC's Research Projects
Group charged with making recommendations to the Chief
Information Officers of that consortium. As a result of these
various efforts, several additional institutions have been
identified as potential participants in the project.</p>

<p>In order to engage additional vendors in the project, Columbia
and CDL are identifying vendors with whom they currently have
agreements for access to licensed resources. Administrators of
the Joint Information Systems Committee in the U.K., who are
closely watching this project, have suggested several vendors who
are working with them on authorizations systems.</p>

<p>Other work currently underway as part of the second phase of
the project includes a draft digital library authentication and
authorization architecture statement that will be presented to
the IETF later this year for consideration as a Request for
Comment (RFC). In addition, publications are being prepared to
communicate the results of the project within various interested
communities, and presentations are being proposed for the Fall
CNI meeting as well as the EDUCAUSE meeting.</p>

<p><b>Institutional policies and practices for the long-term
maintenance of digital materials</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>A joint RLG/DLF initiative, launched following the March
meeting of the DLF Steering Committee, is taking a task force
approach to advance our collective interest in and understanding
of digital preservation policy and practice. Few institutions
have formal policies in place but many institutions have made
commitments to preserve digital materials and are actively
engaged in operational practices supporting the handling and
long-term maintenance of such materials. The goal of the task
force is to identify and document these practices so that DLF and
RLG can identify what kinds of technical, economic, and
organizational barriers institutions are presently confronting
and what kinds of actions are needed to lower those barriers.</p>

<p>The task group will gather and analyze existing digital
preservation policies and practice descriptions for the following
three classes of electronic materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>Institutional Records in Digital Form (e.g., electronic
records);</li>

<li>Locally digitized materials (institutional projects);
and</li>

<li>Electronic Publications.</li>
</ul>

<p>RLG has identified task force members from DLF partner and
allied institutions and work is expected to begin in June.</p>

<p><b>Reference Linking</b></p>
</td>
<td width="68%" valign="top">
<p>In February, the DLF joined the National Information Standards
Organization (NISO), the Society of Scholarly Publishers (SSP),
and the National Federation of Indexing and Abstracting Services
(NFAIS) in sponsoring a workshop on linkage from citations to the
electronic journal literature. The workshop brought together
publishers, librarians, abstracting and indexing services,
repositories, vendors of information services, and end users, in
order to build a common awareness of a broad range of needs and
to improve understanding of the strengths and limitations of
current approaches. In addition, the workshop sought to identify
and stimulate actions needed to improve the facilities for
linking citations and digital objects in the digital environment.
The report of the workshop is available at
http://www.niso.org/linkrpt.html.</p>

<p>As a result of the workshop, the sponsors created a small task
group to explore the issues more fully and particularly to define
the nature and scope of research, user consultation and other
kinds of work necessary to foster the development of general
systems of reference linking for marketplace testing. The report
of the group was issued in May and is available at
http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/Annex/pcaplan/reflink.html. The
report outlines a general framework for the development of
reference linking systems and formed the basis for a second
invitational workshop held on June 9. Among the results of the
most recent workshop was a action plan for additional research by
computer scientists and a call for development, led by DLF, to
solve the problem of selective resolution when there are multiple
copies of a cited work. For more details about the second
workshop, including the report when it is completed, see
http://www.niso.org/linkge2.html.</p>

<p>The Digital Library Federation's first semi-annual Forum on
Digital Library Practices will be held in Washington D.C. the
weekend of July 17-18 at the Doyle Hotel. Professor Gary
Marchionini of the faculty of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science will
launch the one and one-half day forum with a plenary address
entitled <i>Expanding Library Services in the Digital Age: The
Search for Equilibrium</i>. Digital library practitioners from
DLF institutions will hear presentations from other practitioners
on the topics of authentication and authorization systems,
digital repositories, finding aids, page image navigation
systems, and naming systems. The structure of the event has been
developed to allow for significant opportunities for discussion
and exchange. Confirmation letters will be sent to presenters by
mid-June. Confirmations and an updated agenda will be sent to
attendees immediately thereafter.</p>

<p><b>Other activities</b></p>

<p><b>Publications</b>. In June, the Digital Library Federation
released its second publication, <i>Preserving the Whole: A
Two-track Approach to Rescuing Social Science Data and
Metadata</i>, by Ann Green, JoAnn Dionne, and Martin Dennis. CLIR
and DLF have jointly commissioned David Bearman to write a paper
about a migration-based solution to preserving digital
information.</p>

<p><b>Site visits.</b> Waters visited the University of Virginia
as a prelude to receiving an application to join the Federation.
The University of Virginia will probably wait until a new
Director is appointed before joining. Graham visited the
University of Chicago Library.</p>

<p><b>Outreach.</b> Waters continued to participate in the United
States Department of Agriculture Digital Publications
Preservation Steering Committee. He participated in a NSF
Workshop on Data Archival and Information Preservation, and in
the Second International Virtual Libraries Conference at the New
York Public Library, which was devoted largely to the long-term
maintenance of digital materials. He sat on panels to review
proposals submitted to the joint JISC/NSF International Digital
Libraries Research Collaboration and to the Canada Foundation for
Innovation. He also met with visiting archivists from Germany to
discuss possible joint ventures. Graham and Waters both
participated with other DLF members as advisors in a NSF Workshop
to organize the creation of a digital library by states
participating in the Experimental Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</p>

<p>Waters discussed the "The State of the Art in Digital
Preservation" at the 8th Annual Federal Depository Library
Conference and "Changing roles in archiving" at the Society for
Scholarly Publishing seminar on Archiving Journal Literature. At
the CNI Spring Task Force meeting, he made a presentation on
issues governing the sustainability of digital libraries as
organizations, while Graham led a session on the DLF certificate
authorization prototype project. Waters also presented the
results of the DLF Workshop on Social Science Data Archives at
the 25th Annual Conference of the International Association of
Social Science Information Service and Technology (IASSIST). All
presentations are available at
