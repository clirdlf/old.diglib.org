<p></p>

<p>Paula Kaufman, chair, opened the meeting at 10:00 a.m. She
welcomed Harold Billings of the University of Texas at Austin as
the newest Federation member.</p>

<p>The minutes of the last meeting were approved after Don Waters
explained that the earlier draft had been revised upon hearing
member reactions to the section on digital archiving.</p>

<p><b>Review of DLF Activities</b>. Members of the Steering
Committee applauded Waters and Graham for the level of DLF
activity in recent months and the many accomplishments. Waters
briefly reviewed the full activity report and responded to
members' questions and comments.</p>

<p>Members of the Committee agreed that more frequent
communication is needed the DLF Director and partners. Nancy
Eaton urged that DLF staff evaluate developments to help
directors understand where their influence is needed,
particularly so that they can help ensure the creation of
interoperable rather than competing systems. One area in which
such advice is needed is in pointing out how DLF certification
and authentication activities differ from those of the CIC.</p>

<p>The members of the Committee also discussed ways to improve
the communication and interactions among the DLF partners.
Priscilla Caplan and others emphasized the need to get the
technical staffs together to share ideas and approaches to
problems.</p>

<p><b>Budget Analysis</b>. The members engaged in a discussion of
how best to use the capital funds that have been accumulating.
Several members of the committee emphasized that the amount of
money is not large compared to the money that ultimately will
need to be spent. Elaine Sloan noted that many of the projects
now underway have projected publications and follow-on work
attached to them that will require expenditure of these
funds.</p>

<p><b>Future activities</b>. After reviewing the documents on
future activities that Waters distributed, the Steering Committee
agreed with the general divisions of work. Members agreed with
the emphasis on supporting digital library activities that
advanced learning, research and publication, but questioned
whether the characterization of these as "discipline-based"
activities is the most effective description. The committee
decided that the proposed clearinghouse of DLF digitizing
projects is not worth the investment and should not be pursued.
Effort should be spent instead on finding effective ways to bring
partners together to collaborate on projects. The members adopted
the plan identified for an annual review of alliances. And the
proposed budget for the coming year was approved.</p>

<p><b>DLF and international work on digital libraries</b>. Over
lunch, Dr. Mittler gave a provocative talk suggesting numerous
ways that the DLF might facilitate work between the DLF partners
and institutions abroad. This is a topic to which the Steering
Committee will return in a future meeting.</p>

<p><b>Digital Archiving.</b> Jim Michalko presented the findings
of the Hedstrom study that RLG recently commissioned. In the
subsequent discussion, DLF members determined that the interests
of research libraries in digital archiving should be identified
and documented not through the formulation of policies, but by
recording and analyzing the practices currently in place at DLF
institutions for various classes of materials. As several members
phrased it, we want to know what current practices are so we can
decide what needs to be done. DLF will work with RLG to form a
group to document these current practices.</p>

<p>Waters observed that both libraries and publishers have
increasingly recognized that long-term maintenance of the
published literature in digital form is a critical business issue
that must be addressed. It may also be a business opportunity.
The Steering Committee asked the DLF staff to document existing
economic and organizational models for digital archiving and then
to form a DLF group to work with publishers and others and devise
some practical options for the long-term maintenance of digital
publications.</p>

<p><b>Report from Newer Members</b>. The members of the Steering
Committee found the written reports from the new members to be
very interesting and informative. They concluded that a portion
of the membership should report in a similar way at each
meeting.</p>

<p>At 2:45 p.m., the Steering Committee adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled for June 18, 1999.</p>
