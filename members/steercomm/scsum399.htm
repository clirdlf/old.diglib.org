<h2>DLF Steering Committee</h2>

<p><b>Summary of Activity<br />
October 1998 - March 1999<br /></b></p>

<p>The following summary highlights DLF activity since the last
DLF Steering Committee on October 2, 1998</p>

<p><b>Academic Image Exchange</b>. In January, DLF convened a
meeting to explore ways of using digital libraries to enhance the
quality of art history teaching and research in the nation's
colleges and universities. Art history faculty, visual resources
librarians, and representatives of the College Art Association
participated in the meeting. As a result of the meeting,
participants are now proceeding with the development of prototype
mechanism, called an image exchange. The facility would enable
scholars in the field to share with others images, to which they
own the rights, of works referenced in the major art history
textbooks. Work is underway to create a concordance of textbook
images, to define a metadata framework, a submission process, and
requirements for user interfaces. The results of this work will
be assembled in late April or May for a "barn-raising" session
with systems analysts and programmers to design and begin
building the image exchange prototype. Meanwhile, work is
underway in close consultation with the College Art Association
to define possible business models for sustaining the image
exchange and relating it to other key activities in the field
such as AMICO, and to prepare funding proposals. For additional
details see http://www.diglib.org/artxdescription.htm</p>

<p><b>Guides to Quality in Visual Resource Imaging</b>. DLF, CLIR
and RLG have created an editorial board of experts to review the
state of the art in visual resource imaging and to identify
technologies and practices that can be documented and recommended
to the community. The board has decided to focus on documenting
the science of imaging; that is, some of the objective measures
of image qualities, such as color, tone, resolution, etc. and how
they can be controlled in various aspects of an imaging process.
It has identified five areas in which to address these issues:
setting up an imaging project, selecting a scanner, creating a
scanning system, producing a digital master, and generating
digital derivatives. The members of the board created detailed
outlines for guides in these areas and identified possible
authors. DLF and CLIR have commissioned the authors and the
guides are due in June for publication by September. The authors
are Linda Colet (Museum of Modern Art), Donald Williams (Eastman
Kodak Company), Donald D'Amato (Mitretek Systems) and Franziska
Frey (Image Permanence Institute). For additional details, see
http://www.diglib.org/initfuncimage.htm.</p>

<p><b>Social Science Data Archives Workshop.</b> DLF organized
and conducted a workshop held in January at Princeton University.
Social science data managers from DLF institutions joined a
variety of experts to examine the state of the art in three
specific areas: the discovery and retrieval of databases, the
evaluation and interpretation of alternative data sources, and
data extraction for analysis and presentation. Speakers included
prominent faculty in the field, such as Gary King of Harvard,
Richard Rockwell of ICPSR, and Daniel Greenstein of the Arts and
Humanities Data Service in the UK. Participants worked together
to identify a set of project activities that the DLF can
undertake to advance the state of the art in these three areas
with the goal particularly of improving the use of social science
databases in the undergraduate curriculum. Susan Rosenblatt is
preparing a full report of the proceedings, which will be
distributed shortly. For more details, see
http://www.diglib.org/ssdadescription.htm.</p>

<p><b>Technical Architecture Committee</b>. The Committee met in
November at OCLC, following a tradition of meeting with
individuals or institutions who have developed interesting
approaches to digital library architecture. The Committee
explored in detail OCLC's planned development of a Cooperative
Online Resource Catalog (CORC) and called for DLF to convene a
Metadata Committee in part to explore possible DLF contributions
to the CORC project. A member of JSTOR's technical development
staff also attended the meeting and joined in a discussion of
requirements that need to be met for publishers and libraries to
begin using X.509 standard certificates as a means of authorizing
users to gain access to licensed resources. In the course of the
discussions, the Committee formulated an authorization protocol
to be developed under the auspices of DLF. Minutes of the
November meeting are in final stages of preparation and will be
shortly posted on the DLF Web site.</p>

<p><b>Authorization Protocol.</b> Under DLF auspices, the
University of California, Columbia University, JSTOR, and OCLC
are developing a protocol that will enable an information
resource provider to verify that a user bearing a digital
certificate has authority from a home institution to use a
requested resource. A working group met in January to define the
protocol and is planning to have a prototype implementation ready
by April for a presentation at the next CNI meeting. In
subsequent stages of development, the group of participants will
expand to include other institutions and resource providers,
enabling the prototype to be tested against a more complex range
of service and user requirements. A website for the records of
this project is currently in preparation.</p>

<p><b>Reference Linking</b>. In February, the DLF joined the
National Information Standards Organization (NISO), the Society
of Scholarly Publishers (SSP), and the National Federation of
Indexing and Abstracting Services (NFAIS) in sponsoring a
workshop on linkage from citations to the electronic journal
literature. The workshop brought together publishers, librarians,
abstracting and indexing services, repositories, vendors of
information services, and end users, in order to build a common
awareness of a broad range of needs and to improve understanding
of the strengths and limitations of current approaches. In
addition, the workshop sought to identify and stimulate actions
needed to improve the facilities for linking citations and
digital objects in the digital environment. As a result of the
workshop, the sponsors created a small task group to explore the
issues more fully and particularly to define the nature and scope
of research, user consultation and other kinds of work necessary
to foster the development of general systems of reference linking
for marketplace testing. The report of the group is due in early
June for presentation at a second invitational workshop and
subsequent action as appropriate. For more details, including the
report of the workshop, see http://www.niso.org/linkge.html.</p>

<p><b>Internet 2 - Distributed Storage Infrastructure
(I2-DSI).</b> The Innovative Computing Laboratory in the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Tennessee is
designing an architecture and a set of services for dramatically
improving the delivery of large sets of data in a highly
distributed environment. The infrastructure is especially
well-suited, at least in theory, to digital library applications.
Micah Beck and Terry Moore of the Innovative Computing Laboratory
and Bert Dempsey of the School of Information and Library Science
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill organized a
workshop in March to explore how well the emerging infrastructure
meets the needs of various applications, including those of
digital libraries. The DLF helped sponsor the workshop. Among the
potential applications reviewed were a publications project in
the earth sciences being developed at Columbia University and the
Variations Project at Indiana University. A participant in the
Academic Image Exchange project also made a presentation, and the
project will be among the applications receiving support from the
I2-DSI development team. For more information, see
http://dsi.internet2.edu/apps99.html.</p>

<p><b>Metadata Working Group</b>. DLF convened an initial meeting
of metadata experts in February. The group considered how to best
integrate at a descriptive and subject level the various
important Americana resources that are being created in digital
form. The idea for the development of an "academic Lycos" emerged
in this meeting and was defined in a preliminary way as a project
for subsequent work. The group also called for an overview of
issues associated with the recording and use of structural
metadata. And it began planning a series of meetings that would
help familiarize DLF specialists with metadata developments in
the computer science labs associated with the NSF Digital Library
Initiatives and other projects. Minutes of the meeting are in
preparation and will be available on the DLF website.</p>

<p><b>International meeting on archival authority control</b>.
The DLF sponsored a meeting in December of an international group
of archivists to develop a standard encoding format for the
recording and exchange of archival authority information. Such a
format would become part of the emerging archival information
architecture that currently consists of formats for collective
description (e.g., MARC-AMC) and for detailed finding aid
descriptions, especially those using the Encoded Archival
Description (EAD) format. The establishment of a standard for
archival authority records is expected to have a major effect on
the future direction of archival description and resolve many
long-standing issues on how best to record and present archival
data. The meeting resulted in the development of a project plan
outlining the steps necessary to formulate an archive authority
standard. Identified as being of particular importance in
accomplishing adoption of such a standard was the need to
incorporate recommendations into the International Standard
Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and
Families [ISAAR(CPF)]. The ISAAR(CPF) standard will be reviewed
in 2001 providing an opportunity for incorporation of efforts by
this group and its participants. Additional tasks identified in
the project plan were the drafting of an ISAAR compliant DTD, and
definition of Z39.50 attribute set for ISAAR, and ensuring links
to specialized authority files such as those for geographic
information.</p>

<p><b>Publications</b>. In February, the Digital Library
Federation released its first publication, <em>Enabling Access in
Digital Libraries: A Report on a Workshop on Access
Management</em>, edited by Caroline Arms with Judith Klavans and
Donald Waters. In the November/December issue of <i>CLIR
Issues</i>, Waters analyzes the ambiguities of "digital
preservation" as a justification for selecting materials for
digitization.</p>

<p>Next to appear in the DLF series is <i>Preserving the Whole: A
Two-track Approach to Rescuing Social Science Data and
Metadata</i>, by Ann Green and JoAnn Dionne.</p>

<p><b>Site visits.</b> Waters visited the California Digital
Library and the University of Chicago libraries. Graham has
visited Carnegie Mellon libraries, the Yale University Library,
California Digital Library, the libraries at the University of
California at Berkeley, the Princeton University Library, the
Library of Congress, and the Columbia University Library.</p>

<p><b>Executive Subcommittee.</b> An Executive Subcommittee of
the DLF Steering Committee was formed and began work in January
with a two-fold purpose. First, it is charged to help plan the
Steering Committee meetings. Second, it provides a ready-source
of advice for the DLF staff as needed between Steering Committee
meetings on such matters as applications from prospective new
members, specific program plans, budgetary matters, positions
that DLF should take when consulted by outside groups, and so on.
The members of the executive subcommittee for 1999 are Paula
Kaufman (chair), Richard Lucier, Elaine Sloan, Winston Tabb, and
Sarah Thomas.</p>

<p><b>New Members.</b> The University of Texas at Austin joined
the Federation in January. The University of Virginia is
preparing an application.</p>

<p><b>Alliances</b><font face="Arial">.</font> CNI has joined in
an alliance with DLF, on the same terms as RLG, OCLC, and NARA.
That is, CNI and DLF will develop work jointly where our
interests intersect and Clifford Lynch will represent CNI at
Steering Committee meetings as an ally "with voice but without
vote." Clifford has accepted this arrangement between the two
organizations.</p>

<p><b>Outreach.</b> Waters has been invited to sit on the United
States Department of Agriculture Digital Publications
Preservation Steering Committee and made a presentation on
digital preservation issues at the group's inaugural meeting. He
sat on a panel to review proposal submitted in the first round of
the second phase of the NSF Digital Library Initiative. He also
participated in a strategic planning meeting on priorities for
the IMLS program supporting Research in Library and Information
Science.</p>

<p>Waters made general presentations on the issues facing digital
libraries at the University of Chicago, the California Digital
Library, the University of Toronto, and the Library of Congress.
He discussed the "Metadata foundations of digital libraries" at
the NFAIS Annual Meeting, and gave a keynote address on
"Information service issues in an emerging digital environment."
at the Eighth North Carolina Serials Conference. These
presentations are available at
http://www.diglib.org/dlfpresent.htm.</p>

<p><b>Website</b>. The DLF website (at http://www.diglib.org) has
been significantly enhanced. Information about nearly all of the
major ongoing DLF initiatives is now online and regularly
reviewed and updated. A special feature of the Initiatives
section is the development of a standard format that will serve
both to announce workshops as well as report their outcomes.
Links to digital library work at all the partner and allied
institutions are now also available on the DLF website.</p>
