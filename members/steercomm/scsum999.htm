<h2>DLF Steering Committee</h2>

<p><b>Summary of Activity<br />
June ---September 1999<br />
</b>(Current updates reflected in <i>italics</i> below)<br />
</p>

<p><b>Discipline-based digital libraries</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Academic Image Exchange</b>. In January, DLF convened a
meeting to explore ways of using digital libraries to enhance the
quality of art history teaching and research in the nation's
colleges and universities. Art history faculty, visual resources
librarians, and representatives of the College Art Association
participated in the meeting. As a result of the meeting,
participants are now proceeding with the development of a
prototype mechanism, called an image exchange. The facility would
enable scholars in the field to share with others images, to
which they own the rights, of works referenced in the major art
history textbooks. Since March, participants in the project have
opened discussions of the development of the image exchange
through formal presentations at the CNI spring meeting, at a
regional meeting of the Visual Resources Association, and through
a variety of informal presentations with interested organizations
such as AMICO and art history publishers. In addition, DLF
contracted with Robert Baron, an independent art historian and
consultant with expertise in information technology and
intellectual property matters, to serve as project manager. The
Image Exchange organizing group met at Carnegie Mellon University
in Pittsburgh on May 22-23 to design and to begin constructing
the prototype system. With the help of CMU computer scientists,
the group settled on a comprehensive set of features for the
Exchange. The group is now developing a set of these features,
including a concordance of images in key art and architectural
history textbooks, to comprise the prototype Image Exchange.
<i>Funding model details for the Exchange have been developed
along with a generic grant proposal. A proposal for $100,000 to
fund the prototype development was submitted to the Mellon
Foundation for consideration at the September board of trustees
meeting. Robert Baron, Exchange project manager, working under an
interim contract, is finalizing database design and application
specifics, contributor contract language, and a prototype
timeline.</i> For additional details see

<p><b>Digital Library Services: Digitizing and other production
services</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Guides to Quality in Visual Resource Imaging.</b> DLF,
CLIR, and RLG have created an editorial board of experts to
review the state of the art in visual resource imaging and to
identify technologies and practices that can be documented and
recommended to the community. The board has decided to focus on
documenting the science of imaging; that is, some of the
objective measures of image qualities, such as color, tone,
resolution, etc. and how they can be controlled in various
aspects of an imaging process. It has identified five areas in
which to address these issues: setting up an imaging project,
selecting a scanner, creating a scanning system, producing a
digital master, and generating digital derivatives. The members
of the board created detailed outlines for guides in these areas.
DLF and CLIR have commissioned the following authors; Linda
Colette (Museum of Modern Art), Donald Williams (Eastman Kodak
Company), Donald D'Amato (Mitretek Systems) and Franziska Frey
(Image Permanence Institute). <i>The completed guides were
received over the summer and have been reviewed by the editorial
board with requests for changes to two of the authors and
technical review currently being undertaken for the other three
guides. Publication of the guides will be on the RLG Web-site in
late 1999.</i> For additional details, see 
<a href="../standards.htm">http://www.diglib.org/standards.htm</a>.</p>

<p><b>Invitational workshop on technical metadata elements for
image files.</b> The National Information Standards Organization
(NISO), the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)
and the Research Libraries Group (RLG) sponsored an invitational
workshop on April 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> in
Washington DC. The purpose of the workshop was to examine
technical information needed to manage and use digital still
images that reproduce a variety of pictures, documents and
artifacts. Donald Waters was on the organizing committee for the
workshop. Sixty individuals with a wide range of diverse
interests and perspectives on the problem of metadata information
attended the meeting. DLF partner and allied institutions were
well represented among the attendees, who included libraries,
universities, museums, archives, the digital library community,
the government, and the digital imaging vendor community.</p>

<p>Jennifer Trant of the Art Museum Image Consortium facilitated
the meeting. Howard Besser, a member of the organizing committee,
delivered the keynote remarks and was followed by speakers who
reported on metadata initiatives at the Library of Congress, the
Research Libraries Group, the Art Museum Image Consortium, and
the Making of America II project. In the deliberations that
followed, the participants reached agreement on a variety of
issues including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a preliminary list of technical metadata elements</li>

<li>the use of industry standard metrics, where they exist, for
assessing images (for example, tone, color, ICC profiles)</li>

<li>the need to develop methods of pointing at external test
charts</li>

<li>a requirement for mechanisms enabling the metadata associated
with an image to persist through various transformations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Digital Library Services: Access management
services</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Developing systems of authorization.</b> Digital
certificates offer a secure means of authorizing access to a
range of campus systems and resources and are becoming part of
campus technology infrastructure. Under DLF auspices, the
University of California, Columbia University, JSTOR, and OCLC
are developing a protocol that will enable an information
resource provider to verify that a user bearing a digital
certificate has authority from a home institution to use a
requested resource. The prototype system being developed combines
the use of X.509 digital certificates for authentication with a
directory service providing authorization to licensed resources
based on user attributes. The first phase of work on the project
was presented at the CNI Spring Meeting in Washington, D.C., in
April 1999. Following the meeting, project participants met and
outlined a work plan for a second phase of development.</p>

<p>The group focused on the need to recruit additional
participants for further testing and development of the protocol.
They devised a strategy to engage additional participants by
aiming at campus technology organizations as well as at
libraries. The DLF has worked with the Corporation for Research
and Educational Networking (CREN) to develop a paper of
frequently asked questions and answers about the use of digital
certificates that is aimed at senior campus administrators. In
addition, project participants presented the project to the IT
directors attending the spring meeting of the Common Solutions
Group. In early June, project members attended a meeting of the
Committee on Institutional Cooperation's Research Projects Group,
which is charged with making recommendations to the chief
information officers of that consortium. As a result of these
efforts, several additional institutions have been identified as
potential participants in the project.</p>

<p>To engage more vendors in the project, Columbia and the
California Digital Library are identifying those with whom they
currently have agreements for access to licensed resources.
Administrators of the Joint Information Systems Committee in the
U.K., who are watching this project closely, have suggested
several vendors who are working with them on authorization
systems.</p>

<p>Other work under way in the project's second phase includes a
draft digital library authentication and authorization
architecture statement that will be presented to the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) later this year for consideration
as a Request for Comment. In addition, publications are being
prepared to report the results of the project, and presentations
are being proposed for meetings at CNI and EDUCAUSE. <i>In
addition, publications are being prepared to communicate the
results of the project within various interested communities, and
presentations are slated for the EDUCAUSE meeting later this
year. Along these lines, DLF and CREN jointly sponsored the
development and publication of "Digital Certificate
Infrastructure: Frequently Asked Questions" which will be
distributed through various means. Increasing interest in the
project has brought a number of inquiries to project participants
over the last few months. Collaborations are currently being
developed with the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) and
the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC).</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>Digital Library Services: Archival and Preservation
services</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>International meeting on archival authority control</b>. In
December 1998, the DLF sponsored a meeting of an international
group of archivists to develop a standard encoding format for the
recording and exchange of archival authority information. Such a
format would become part of the emerging archival information
architecture that currently consists of formats for collective
description (e.g., MARC-AMC) and for detailed finding aid
descriptions, especially those using the Encoded Archival
Description (EAD) format. The establishment of a standard for
archival authority records is expected to have a major effect on
the future direction of archival description and to resolve many
long-standing questions about how best to record and present
archival data. The meeting resulted in the development of a plan
outlining the steps necessary to formulate an archive authority
standard. Identified as being of particular importance in
accomplishing adoption of such a standard was the need to
incorporate recommendations into the International Standard
Archival Authority Record for Corporate Bodies, Persons, and
Families [ISAAR (CPF)]. The ISAAR (CPF) standard will be reviewed
in 2001, providing an opportunity for incorporation of efforts by
this group and its participants. Additional tasks identified in
the project plan were the drafting of an ISAAR-compliant
document-type definition (DTD), definition of a Z39.50 attribute
set for ISAAR, and ensuring links to specialized authority files
such as those for geographic information. <i>The final report can
be found at 
<a href="../standards/aayalefr.htm">http://www.diglib.org/standards/aayalefr.htm.</a></i></p>

<p><b>Institutional policies and practices for the long-term
maintenance of digital materials.</b></p>

<p>The DLF and RLG have formed a task force to advance the
understanding of digital preservation policy and practice. Few
institutions have formal policies in place but many have made
commitments to preserve digital materials and are adopting
practices to support the handling and long-term maintenance of
such materials. The goal of the task force is to identify and
document these practices so that DLF and RLG can identify what
kinds of technical, economic, and organizational barriers
institutions are facing, and what kinds of actions are needed to
reduce those barriers.</p>

<p>The task group will gather and analyze existing digital
preservation policies and practice descriptions for the following
three classes of electronic materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>institutional records in digital form</li>

<li>locally digitized materials</li>

<li>electronic publications</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Jim Michalko will provide an update on the work of the task
forces during the meeting.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>Digital Library Services: Discovery and retrieval
services</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Distributed Finding Aids.</b> This collaborative project,
under the direction of John-Price Wilkin at the University of
Michigan, is exploring the means and costs of searching encoded
finding aids that are distributed at different institutions.
<i>The final report has been received and can be found at 
<a href="../architectures/dfas.htm">http://www.diglib.org/architectures/dfas.htm</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>Digital Library Architecture</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Technical Architecture Committee</b>. <i>The committee met
at the Library of Congress in July. Updates on DLF projects were
provided to the committee along with a presentation by Library of
Congress and Artesia Technologies staff on TEAMS, the digital
assets management software that LC is currently implementing. An
extensive discussion of the "Harvard problem" (how to deliver
location/selection information to users when more than one copy
of an article exists) ensued with three variant models being
designed. Priscilla Caplan and Dale Flecker have drafted a paper
on the alternative approaches and salient discussion points which
has been distributed to committee members for comment. The
finalized paper will serve as the basis of a DLF-sponsored
meeting to initiate a discussion on the proposed approaches with
a small group of participants representing libraries, publishers,
abstract and indexing providers, and aggregators.</i></p>
</div>

<p><b>Framework for institutional development and
collaboration</b></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Management forums.</b> <i>Sixty-three digital library
practitioners from across DLF institutions attended the first
semiannual Forum on Digital Library Practices, held July 17-18 at
the Doyle Hotel in Washington D.C. Professor Gary Marchionini, on
the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's
School of Information and Library Science, launched the one and
one-half day forum with his talk "Expanding Library Services in
the Digital Age: The Search for Equilibrium." The remainder of
the event was filled with presentations on authentication and
authorization systems, digital repositories, finding aids, page
image navigation systems, and naming systems. Forum
presentations, participants, and other details can be found
at</i> 
<a href="../forums/fs99agenda.htm"><i>http://www.diglib.org/forums/fs99agenda.htm</i></a>
