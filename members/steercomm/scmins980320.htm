<h2>DLF Steering Committee</h2>

<b>Minutes of meeting on March 20, 1998</b> 

<p><b>Present:</b> S. Bennett (Yale), R. Cahoon (NARA), J.
Campbell (USC), N. Cline (Harvard), B. Gosling (Michigan), J.
Gotwals (Emory), P. Kaufman (Tennessee), M. Keller (Stanford), C.
Mason (Minnesota, for T. Shaughnessy), S. Rosenblatt (UC
Berkeley, for P. Lyman), E. Sloan (Columbia), S. Thomas
(Cornell), S. Thorin (Indiana), K. Trainer (Princeton), W. Tabb
(LC), W. Walker (NYPL), D. Waters (DLF), L. West (RLG, for J.
Michalko)</p>

<p><b>Absent:</b> N. Eaton (Penn State), D. Marcum (CLIR), P.
Mosher (U Pennsylvania), D. Muccino (OCLC)</p>

<p><b>Guests:</b> Michael Lesk (NSF) and George Farr (NEH) at
lunch</p>

<p>Waters brought the meeting of the DLF Steering Committee to
order at 10:10 a.m. on March 20, 1998. He welcomed those present
and thanked everyone for their graciousness in hosting him for
the site visits he made during the last five months. He also
thanked them for their energetic and thoughtful participation in
the three subcommittees on Program, Organization, and Budget.
Their participation made the program, organization, and budget
work truly a joint effort and the results to be reviewed in this
meeting a joint product.</p>

<p>In the review of the agenda, Waters asked permission to take
one item out of the proposed order, namely the question of the
Steering Committee chair.</p>

<p><b>Steering Committee chair.</b> Waters noted that as Director
of the DLF he was an ex officio member of the Steering Committee,
subject to the oversight of the Committee, and so should not
serve as Committee chair. He said that he had convened a
nominating committee consisting of Cline, Gosling, and Sloan to
nominate a chair. They nominated Thomas, and she had agreed just
prior to the meeting to serve a one-year term. Waters formally
turned the chair over to Thomas, but said that he would still
help conduct the meeting because she had no time to prepare.</p>

<p><b>Program direction.</b> The Committee reviewed the
definition, the institutional goals, the program priorities, and
the projects and plans, as described in the program document.
During the ensuing discussion, the following issues were among
those raised:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is vital for the DLF to represent the scholarly community
and the interests of fair use against the commercial publishing
arena. However, under the umbrella of scholarly interests, the
interests of scholars as authors sometimes conflict with the
interests of scholars as teachers.</li>

<li>The institutional goals that DLF seeks to support should not
be viewed as fixed in time. The work of the DLF, for example,
should be regarded as a discovery process in which DLF might
identify from its work new goals that institutions will
incorporate in their priorities.</li>

<li>There is not a clear mapping of the DLF priorities and its
projects and plans to the institutional goals DLF aims to
support. The revision of the program document should seek to
clarify the relationships among these three components.</li>

<li>The proposed Michigan/Harvard project posits a complicated
and expensive retrieval system and so may be misdirecting DLF
resources. Waters said that the authors themselves recognized
problems in the proposal and were revising it. Further, Waters
said he will follow the practice that CLIR uses to subject
unsolicited proposals like this one to a blind peer review before
approving them for funding.</li>

<li>The DLF plans for work on authorization may lead to overly
complicated designs, when "adequate" technical solutions would
instead prove sufficient. Mason and Waters described the plans
for the CIC authorization project, which call for a phased
approach and detailed evaluations after each phase to ensure that
the technical design matches the problems that the project is
trying to solve.</li>

<li>The description of DLF program work to provide organizational
support for library directors needs to be clarified. It should
emphasize that there are a number of program topics to which the
library directors are in the best position to contribute.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subject to these concerns and qualifications, which will be
addressed in a revised program statement, the Steering Committee
endorsed the proposed program agenda.</p>

<p><b>DLI-II.</b> Michael Lesk (NSF) and George Farr (NEH) joined
the Committee at noon to discuss the recently announced Phase II
of the Digital Library Initiative grant program. Over lunch, Lesk
described the focal areas of the recently announced DLI-II
program and contrasted it with the Knowledge and Distributed
Intelligence program. He also mentioned work underway to link
digital library research in the U.S. to related research abroad
in an international program that NSF is developing.</p>

<p>Lesk emphasized that, compared to DLI-I, the DLI-II program
specifically includes user-oriented research and applied research
themes. Moreover, the criteria for evaluating proposed projects
is designed to help select projects that hold the greatest
promise for sustainability. He said that these features were all
intended to ensure that the program reached a broad audience of
researchers, not just computer scientists. He said that NSF is
particularly interested in attracting the research interests and
direct involvement of libraries such as those represented in the
DLF. Farr added that these features had attracted the interest of
NEH as a co-sponsor of DLI-II, and he too hoped that DLF
institutions would participate in the program by generating
compelling proposals.</p>

<p>After Lesk and Farr left, Waters asked for advice on what role
the DLF should aim to play in the DLI-II program. The advice of
the Committee was that DLF should aim to submit a proposal,
provided that it complements and supports, but does not directly
conflict with work that partner institutions are individually
proposing.</p>

<p><b>Organizational Issues.</b> The Committee discussed the
principles of organization, the categories of participation, the
internal organization and the by-law proposals regarding payment
of DLF fees, the disbursement of DLF funds for travel, and the
principles for disbursement of the capital fund. During the
ensuing discussion, members of the Steering Committee made the
following points:</p>

<ul>
<li>The criterion for partnership - that prospective partners
must demonstrate that they are operating digital libraries -
should explicitly refer to the working definition of digital
library that DLF has adopted.</li>

<li>Perhaps some explanation should be offered in the document
about why DLF regards RLG and OCLC as formal allies.</li>

<li>A qualification should be added that the Steering Committee
"normally" meets three times a year, to allow for the possibility
of both more and less meetings depending on the
circumstances.</li>

<li>The DLF should be sure to draw from the university community
as a high priority when forming the Review Panel.</li>

<li>The by-law on travel for the Technical Architecture Committee
should be reworded so that it is clear that systems staff members
are not the only ones in libraries facing stiff competition for
their time and attention.</li>

<li>The by-law on travel for staff in DLF institutions should be
rephrased to emphasize that the constraint against funding staff
travel is the availability of funds within DLF, not the
discretion of the DLF director.</li>

<li>The Director should be subject to a limit on the amount he
can dispense without additional approvals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subject to these qualifications, which will be addressed in a
revised document, the Steering Committee approved the proposed
statement of organization and by-laws.</p>

<p><b>Non-payment of fees.</b> In light of the by-laws just
approved regarding payment of DLF fees, the Committee asked
Waters to identify any partners who had not paid their fees. He
should address the matter with them and report back at the next
meeting.</p>

<p><b>New Partners.</b> After reviewing the application of the
California Digital Library (CDL) to become a strategic partner
within the DLF, the Steering Committee agreed to welcome the CDL
as a new partner. The Steering Committee further agreed to
streamline the process for considering prospective partners. It
asked the Director to ensure that prospective partners meet the
criteria for partnership and describe how they meet the criteria
in writing. When the Director is satisfied with an application,
he should refer it to a subcommittee of the Steering Committee
for review. If the subcommittee is satisfied then the Director
may accept the application without referring it to the full
Steering Committee.</p>

<p>Some members expressed concern that the Steering Committee is
reaching a size in which meetings of a committee-of-the-whole are
becoming unmanageable. They suggested that the DLF should place
an upper limit on the number of new partners it will accept.
While recognizing these concerns, the Committee agreed to
postpone further discussion of limits on the number of partners
until a later time, when clearer evidence is in hand about actual
interest in DLF.</p>

<p><b>Budget.</b> The Steering Committee reviewed and approved
the revised operating budget for FY97/98. It also reviewed and
approved the proposed operating budget for FY98/99. The Committee
approved a motion to continue to charge $19,000 as the annual
operating fee for the next fiscal year.</p>

<p>Before the Committee adjourned, members asked if the program
agenda and statement of organization could be made available for
distribution within DLF institutions when the documents are
revised. Waters said that he had begun to relocate the DLF web
site from the LC web to CLIR's web site. The program agenda and
the statement of organization will both be included on the web
site. Moreover, a revision of the documents will also be
available in paper form as soon as possible. In addition, CLIR is
assisting DLF in the preparation of a brochure that will be
designed for DLF partners to distribute to foundations and other
funding agencies.</p>

<p>The meeting adjourned at 2:50 p.m.</p>
