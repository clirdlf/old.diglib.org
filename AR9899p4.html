<h3 align="left">Workshop on Technical Metadata Elements for
Image Files</h3>

<p>In April 1999, NISO, CLIR, and RLG sponsored an invitational
workshop to examine the technical information needed to manage
and use digital still images that reproduce a variety of
pictures, documents, and artifacts. Sixty individuals with
diverse interests and perspectives on the problem of metadata
information attended the meeting. DLF member institutions were
well represented among the attendees, which included libraries,
universities, museums and archives, as well as representatives
from government, other digital library organizations, and the
digital imaging vendor community. By the end of the meeting, the
participants reached agreement on a variety of issues, including
the following:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>a preliminary list of technical metadata elements

<p></p>
</li>

<li>the use of industry standard metrics, where they exist, for
assessing images (for example, tone, color, International Color
Consortium (ICC) profiles)

<p></p>
</li>

<li>the need to develop methods of pointing to external test
charts

<p></p>
</li>

<li>a requirement for mechanisms enabling the metadata associated
with an image to persist through various transformations</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left">International Meeting on Archival Authority
Control</h3>

<p>In December 1998, the DLF sponsored a meeting of an
international group of archivists to develop a standard encoding
format for the recording and exchange of archival authority
information. Their intention is that such a format would become
part of the emerging archival information architecture that
currently consists of formats for collective description (e.g.,
MARC-AMC) and for detailed finding aid descriptions, especially
those using the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) format. The
establishment of a standard for archival authority records is
expected to have a major effect on the future direction of
archival description and to resolve many long-standing questions
about how best to record and present archival data. The meeting
resulted in the development of a plan outlining the steps
necessary to formulate an archive authority standard. Identified
as being of particular importance in accomplishing adoption of
such a standard was the need to incorporate recommendations into
the International Standard Archival Authority Record for
Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families [ISAAR (CPF)]. The ISAAR
(CPF) standard will be reviewed in 2001, providing an opportunity
for incorporation of efforts by this group and its participants.
Additional tasks identified in the project plan were the drafting
of an ISAAR-compliant document-type definition (DTD), definition
of a Z39.50 attribute set for ISAAR, and ensuring links to
specialized authority files such as those for geographic
information.</p>

<h3 align="left">Metadata Working Group</h3>

<p>The DLF convened an initial meeting of metadata experts in
February 1999. The group considered how to best integrate, at
descriptive and subject levels, the important Americana being
created in digital form. The idea to develop an "academic Lycos"
emerged in this meeting and was defined in a preliminary way as a
project for subsequent work. The group also called for an
overview of issues associated with the recording and use of
structural metadata. And it began planning a series of meetings
that would help familiarize practitioners at DLF institutions
with metadata developments in the computer science labs
associated with the NSF Digital Library Initiative and other
projects.</p>

<h3 align="left">Technical Architecture Committee</h3>

<p>Following a tradition of meeting with individuals or
institutions that have developed interesting approaches to
digital library architecture, the Technical Architecture
Committee met with staff of OCLC in November 1998. The committee
explored in detail OCLC's planned development of a Cooperative
Online Resource Catalog (CORC) and recommended that DLF convene a
metadata committee in part to explore possible DLF contributions
to the CORC project. A member of JSTOR's technical development
staff also attended the meeting and joined in a discussion of
requirements that need to be met for publishers and libraries to
begin using X.509 standard certificates as a means of authorizing
users to gain access to licensed resources. In the course of the
discussions, the committee formulated an authorization protocol
to be developed under the auspices of DLF. Minutes of the
November meeting are posted on the DLF Web site.</p>

<h3 align="left">Internet2&mdash;Distributed Storage
Infrastructure (I2-DSI)</h3>

<p>The Innovative Computing Laboratory in the Department of
Computer Science at the University of Tennessee is designing an
architecture and a set of services to dramatically improve the
delivery of large sets of data in a highly distributed
environment. In theory, the Internet2 infrastructure is
especially well suited to digital library applications. With
partial support from the DLF, Micah Beck and Terry Moore, of the
Innovative Computing Laboratory, and Bert Dempsey, of the School
of Information and Library Science at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, organized a workshop in March to explore
how well the emerging infrastructure meets the needs of various
applications, including those of digital libraries. Workshop
participants considered several projects that could test the new
infrastructure. Among the applications reviewed were a project
for publications in the earth sciences being developed at
Columbia University and a project to deliver online access to
sound recordings being developed at Indiana University. A
participant in the Academic Image Exchange project also made a
presentation, and the project will be among the applications
receiving support from the I2-DSI development team. More
