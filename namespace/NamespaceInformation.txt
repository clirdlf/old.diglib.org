Identifiers in the dlf namespace are used to identify 
information assets used in Digital Library Federation 
research and development projects.  Identifiers will vary according to project.  Their uses currently include:

* Target namespaces for XML Schema, for example: info:dlf/Aquifer/AssetActions/AssetDefinition/

* Identifiers for use in ontologies, for example RDF property labels, such as:  info:dlf/Aquifer/AssetActions/getWebView
