\par }{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 According to Sally McCallum's article "An introduction to the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)" in }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 Library Hi Tech}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 
 (v. 22, no. 1, 2004: pp 82-88), descriptive categories defined in FRBR for top level MODS elements are as follows:
\par 
\par Work: <titleInfo type="uniform">, <name>, <genre>, <target audience>, <classification>, <subject>
\par Expression: <typeOfResource>, <language>, <abstract>, <tableOfContents>
\par Manifestation: <titleInfo>, <originInfo>, <physicalDescription>, <note>, <identifier>, <relatedItem>
\par Item: <location>, <accessCondition>
\par 
\par The draft MODS Implementation Guidelines do not refer to FRBR, nor are the elements structured to conform to the FRBR conceptual model. Sinc
e the guidelines specifically distinguish between description of the intellectual content and genre of a resource and its digital format and location, we were surprised that terminology such as work, expression, manifestation, and item are omitted from th
is draft.
\par 
\par In the case of moving images, these type of resources are generally conceptualized at the work/expression level, rather than at the manifestation level, using the title of the work/expression as the key identifier (as a primary example, The Inter
net Movie Database organizes its database by citing titles at the work level). Titles may change due to different markets (foreign language titles, for instance); nevertheless, the overall visual content is derived from the same original source material, 
resulting in different versions (or expressions). 
\par 
\par Although we recognize that in libraries, <titleInfo> is key to describing the item in hand, for moving image resources, this causes considerable confusion since the content contained within commercially di
stributed videos for the home market carries the original credits of the motion picture or television program. A video distributor may overlay additional credits over the original credits, such as episode titles and numbers for television series, but for 
motion pictures, especially, the }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 original}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 
 credits are generally kept intact. This would most likely still be the case if the moving image resource were available for download.  Based on the guidelines and the descriptive categories defined in FRBR, perhaps 
it should be stipulated that the <titleInfo type="uniform"> always be present that for any moving image resource (since moving images have as an historical precedent identification by title of original release as their primary access point).

\par }{\b\f1\fs22\ul\insrsid5388731 Describing Versions and Reproductions
\par 
\par }{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 In the draft of }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 Best Practices for Shareable Metadata}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 
 (Aug. 2005), the One-to-One Principle "designed to forestall the common problem of metadata that describes more than one version of a resource" (p. 11) emphasizes completed wor
ks, rather than various related elements that are brought together to form the completed work. This is further emphasized in that the moving image example provided ("Example 2: Record for a film"), which describes the digital surrogate of an analog refere
n
ce print (completed work). For archival moving image resources, analog components that make up a work can number into the hundreds. Although not specifically stated, it seems that MODS, then, is designed for digital resources that have a one-to-one relati
onship to its analog original?  This should be clarified.

\par p. 7: Choice of title governed by one content standard only is not practical for all types of resources. Explicitly refers to AACR2 and DACS which we understand to be listed as examples only. These standards are not applicable for works of art (should use
 
Getty standard), architecture, or moving images. For example, moving images may need to derive titles from companion standards such as AMIM2 where AACR2 is deficient in the formulation of titles for particular types of moving images, such as a collection 
of commercials.  Choice of content standard should be flexible. 
\par 
\par p. 7:  }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 Supplied title}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 . Recommends not using brackets for supplied titles, which we support since their purpose is not always apparent to end-users and their inclusion can cause indexing probl
ems for some types of systems. However, without the brackets, how does the user know the title is supplied? Add the value \'93supplied\'94 to the \'93type\'94
 attribute, since cataloging materials at the item level is predisposed to transcription at the manifestation level. We understand that this change would necessitate further adjustment because currently the primary title does not use the \'93type\'94
 attribute.

\par }{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 p. 11: We support the practice of including as many <name> elements for contributors as are readily available, especially important for moving image resources, a collaborative art form not easily attributed to only three people.

\par p. 20: subelements. There is a publisher, but there should also be a distributor. In 
moving images, a production company/studio/network can produce the film (ex.: RKO), but the source that is digitized can be distributed decades later by a different company (ex.: Milestone). 
\par 
\par p. 20-21: Dates: For moving image resources, the importance of 
original release/broadcast date cannot be overestimated since original distribution date is critical for identification purposes.  Citation practice favors original release/broadcast date, not the date of release of the manifestation. For example, the ori
ginal }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 King Kong}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731  (1933) was released for the home video market on DVD in 2005. Peter Jackson's }{\i\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 King Kong}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 
 was released in theaters in 2005. Therefore, if one follows the FRBR definitions for top-level MODS elements, <dateIssued> would be the date of release o
f the manifestation [KING KONG (2005) and KING KONG (2005)]. In the absence of a creator as primary access point, to distinguish between the two works, it is critical to differentiate them by original release date, which is what most users would expect: K
ING KONG (1933) and KING KONG (2005). We suggest stipulating that moving images use both the date of original release/broadcast and the date of distribution for the manifestation, if applicable.
\par 
\par p. 20-21:   Which term would be used for \'93born digital\'94 objects such as direct digital photography of art objects or architecture: dateCaptured, or dateCreated? Be explicit. 
\par 
\par p. 21:  Date question:  Do these rules allow for BC dates? 
\par 
\par }{\f1\fs22\cf1\insrsid5388731 p. 22: It would be useful to include an example with a date using the YYYY-MM-DD
 format because this is frequently included for television and radio programs. The recommended W3CDTF encoding allows for this, but an example would be helpful.}{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 
\par 
\par p. 22:  <edition>:  Do the guidelines recommend not including an edition statement if it is no
t explicitly on the work? This is applicable to textual, printed works. Moving images often do not have edition or version statements on them, and knowing which version of the work is key for users. Need to be flexible for moving images, and follow AMIM2 
rules for supplying edition/version statements. 
\par 
\par }{\b\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 <language>
\par 
\par }{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 p. 24-25: For moving images, need to allow for location of the language: soundtrack and subtitles. Should have attributes with values for each.

y>:  We can understand that this can go in technical metadata as it refers to the digital surrogate creation. However, it describes the quality of the digital file used by the user, so should be included in the descriptive metadata as well. It will help e
xplain why an image/document/video/audio etc. has poor quality.

\par }{\f1\fs22\insrsid5388731 This is an important element, as it describes the source that was digitized. Need more guidance on the kind of information about
 the original source that was scanned that should be included in this field. At a minimum, this element should include original source medium, dimensions, color (the source could have been color, but was scanned in grayscale so the digital file does not t
r
uly represent the original source color), and date of creation. The Library of Congress example record for a film on p. 76 does include the MARC 300 field, but it does not say when the source print was created (just the creation date of the original film)
.
\par 
\par p. 43:  <keyDate>:  In the case of photographs of artworks, architecture, and geographic sites, \'93Date of creation\'94
 would be the date of the photograph capture or creation--different than the date the artwork represented was created, and different than the date the photograph was scanned. If the date of the original source\rquote 
s creation can be added to the <originInfo> element, perhaps this can be solved. More than one date type can often be included in a record to describe the date of the content creation (e
.g., 1689), date of photograph capture (1944), and date of digitization (2006). The various dates are important to historians in tracking an object\rquote 
s deterioration: date of capture represents how the content object looked at the time it was photographed, and date of digitization represents how the photograph looked at the time it was scanned.
