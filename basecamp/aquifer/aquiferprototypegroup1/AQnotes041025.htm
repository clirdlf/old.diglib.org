<p class=MsoNormal>The group reviewed the numerous pieces of work contributed
by members in response to actions taken at the August 5, 2004 meeting. In so doing, they framed and focused Aquifer’s as a development initiative by:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Focusing initial technology development effort on tool
     suites that will enable development of high-quality curated collections
     from the numerous online collections that are currently on offer from
     Aquifer and DLF member institutions – notably tools that enable essential
     metadata capture, analysis, normalization, enrichment/transformation</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Enhancing Aquifer’s organizational structure through the
     addition of an Architecture Design and Integration Group (the group’s
     development likely anticipates longer term, the development of a
     Collection Development Group, and a User Services and Assessment Group)
     and by recommending employment on a full time basis of a Digital Library
     architect and Program Manager </li>

understanding is developed with reference to numerous studies conducted from
the perspective of libraries and other organizations as information suppliers,
as well as those that are conducted from the perspective of end users in
specific user communities.  Before launching off on highly specific and intensive
user-based investigation, Aquifer will consolidate our evolving understanding
by commissioning a survey of relevant existing needs assessment research
conducted both from supplier and user perspectives. The survey will: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The American South and American
West projects are making substantial progress building curated collections that
bear on history, culture, and society in these two regions of the United States. Cumulatively, they are working with over xxx distributed online collections,
offered by xxx institutions and comprising xxx digital items. In shaping the
collections and determining how best to present them (e.g. topically,
thematically, etc) they have worked extensively with a variety of end-user
communities. Through this process, the projects have developed detailed
collection planning and development strategies and processes and early
instantiations of the tools required to implement them. They have also identified
significant gaps in the online content that has been offered to them.</p>

at the American South and American West projects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>In particular, Aquifer will
surface additional content bearing on aspects of American history, culture, and
society, ensuring that such additional collection content is used to enrich
existing American South and American West virtual collections as currently
being defined by those projects (and taking on various chronological, regional,
as well as thematic complexions). It will also ensure that additional
collection content will be used in the development of new virtual collections not
now being considered by either the American West or American South projects, for
example, on other regions of the United States and/or addressing selected
topics and/or themes on a national basis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The group agreed as well to
explore how to fill in two significant gaps identified by both the American

that review, costed strategies for building collections of American music that
at a minimum embrace these three kinds of materials. The strategy document
should identify prospective information sources, mechanisms for integrating
distributed information content that will suitably ensure persistent access to
it (although persistence isn’t likely to be an issue for materials available
from libraries, public television and radio stations, and/or the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting, it may be an issue for suitable content located on
more transient sites that are set up to host and encourage peer-to-peer file
sharing of openly accessible audio recordings) as well as initial assessment of
the rights management implications bound up with Aquifer’s use of any prospective
collection (may be an issue with some content sourced from sites established to
encourage audio file sharing). Aquifer members to recommend possible experts to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>DS reported on four related
developments: of the Aquifer Wiki, the Aquifer listserv, and on two Aquifer
registries necessary to identify and keep track of (a) collections contributed
by Aquifer and DLF members and (b) user needs research that may guide and
inform Aquifer and other digital library development effort. The following
actions were agreed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><b>Action</b>: DS to work with EC
(Minnesota is a possible Wiki host), TC (Illinois is a possible collection
registry host) and Michigan (Michigan hosts the existing DLF collection
registry) to identify and formalize a client/data-center relationship with one
or more information services capable of hosting and sustaining its basic
communications tools as 24x7 operational services (CLIR/DLF information
services are provided by a commercial ISP not capable economically of managing
the Wiki or the registries). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><b>Action</b>: TC, in consultation
with DS and others to develop a strategy for building and rolling out the
collection registry. The registry will adopt a collection schema based upon the
Collection Application Profile (CAP) that is currently under development by the
DLF.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><b>Action</b>: MK/DG/Aq Dir/
Aquifer needs to notify DLF member institutions about Aquifer’s collection
development interests and to urge them to offer collections. In that
solicitation, DLF member institutions need to be fully briefed about the level
of commitment required from those contributing to Aquifer collections , for
example, with regard to collection scope and focus, but also with regard to
basic persistent, standards, and interoperability requirements that Aquifer
will make. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The group reviewed several pieces
of work contributed by members framing follow up work in key technical areas
including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>development of tools and strategies for metadata capture,

     services) for organizing collection content (Stanford)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>environmental scan of tool suites and approaches available
     in the proximate IMS community that may be relevant to the Aquifer effort
     (Stanford)</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>It concluded that Aquifer lacked
the mechanism necessary to progress and co-ordinate the substantial and complex
technology development effort and alignment that it would require. Accordingly,
it recommended the establishment of an Architecture Design and Integration
Group and the full-time employment by Aquifer of a digital library architect
and program manger. It also recommended a commissioned review of existing
approaches to and tools becoming available for metadata capture, analysis, normalization,
transformation/enrichment, and subsetting. These action items are described
below</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i>Architecture, Design, and
Integration Group</i>. Aquifer will convene a small (6 or so people) group that
will, with initiative’s broader aims in view, advise and guide: </p>

role ensuring that Aquifer’s efforts leverage those ongoing in the broader
digital library community and proximate information communities (e.g. IMS). It
will also help ensure that Aquifer digital library content and services can be

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><i>Digital Library Architect and
Program Manager</i>. The group discussed the fundamental constraints that exist
and have existed upon DLF working groups (whether looking at technical or other
issues) that are staffed on a volunteer basis. It agreed that volunteer groups
have considerable capacity to surface good ideas through discussion, to focus
attention on particular issues, even to establish priorities for action. It was
also agreed that it was possible for such groups to surface or contribute from
their own institution, programming effort that might be required in any
co-development initiative to which they might give route. Such groups, however,
lacked the capacity necessary to bridge the evolution and prioritization of
good ideas on the one hand, and co-development effort on the other.
Accordingly, the Aquifer initiative recommends and arguably requires a
full-time specialist to provide staffing support for the ADIG. The DLAP will
not only administer and provide facilitated leadership for the group but also
follow up for it on actions that required investigative and other efforts over
and above those which volunteer members might be expected to contribute. The
review of metadata capture, analysis, normalization, and enrichment tools
described above is one example, of this kind of effort. In addition, the DLAP
would provide the coordination necessary in any co-development effort that the
Aquifer partners might undertake, ensuring that programming and other technical
effort located at distributed partner sites was appropriate aligned, etc.
Finally, the DLAP would help communicate Aquifer’s technical and architectural
agenda and perspectives to those working on complementary and similar problems
in other information communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The group agreed that encouraging
“good practice” amongst metadata providers was one of three strategies it would
adopt in developing aggregated collection with sufficiently rich item-level
information to enable flexible and refined approaches to collection
organization (ontology), and etc. It agreed that two other approaches would be
explored in successive phases of Aquifer’s development, notably those involving:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>The tripartite approach to
metadata enrichment was determined in part to assure a relatively low-barrier
to participation in (data contribution to) Aquifer, and also as a means of
providing a range of incentives to data providers to contribute metadata,
notably: third party analysis and validation of their metadata and enrichment
(and ultimate return) of their collection metadata</p>
