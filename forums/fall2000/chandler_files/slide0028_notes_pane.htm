  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The California
  Digital Library was founded in 1997 by University of California President
  Richard Atkinson, who called it &quot;a library without walls.&quot; CDL
  staff and advisory groups are drawn from every UC campus, from affiliated
  research laboratories, and from the UC Office of the President. The Library
  is built on the extensive base of UC knowledge and experience in developing
  and distributing digital materials. Four strategies define the Library's
  vision: <b>building, sharing, and preserving digital collections</b>; <b>creating
  tools and services</b>; <b>influencing and supporting innovation in scholarly
  communication</b>; and <b>developing strategic partnerships for digital
  library development</b>. As you will see as I talk about the California
  Counts project all four of these visions apply to CA Counts apply to CA
  Counts</font><br>
