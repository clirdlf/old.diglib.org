<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Lorcan Dempsey</b>, Director,
Distributed National Electronic Resource of the UK Higher
Education Funding Council's Joint Information Systems Committee 

<p>The UK has a tradition of central funded activity in the
provision of network and information services. The utility of
this central activity is recognised, and is now being built on to
create a Distributed National Electronic Resource. This will
further develop a rich information and learning resource, woven
into the fabric of people's working and learning lives.</p>

<p>This presentation will describe the current provision of
national services, and the steps being taken to move these to a
new level. It will discuss a coherent national programme which
embraces:</p>

<ul>
<li>collection development and management - the acquisition and
creation of deep information and learning resources</li>

<li>information environment - the creation of an environment
which supports the effective discovery, fusion and reuse of
content from multiple sources</li>

<li>preservation - the need to secure continued access to the
intellectual record</li>

<li>advice and support - concerted activities to accelerate and
inform development. 

<p>It will discuss issues posed by this ambitious programme, and
describe current achievements.</p>

Interoperability through metadata harvesting. Holabird Room</h3>

 <b>Herbert von de Sompel</b>, Visiting Assistant Professor,

Carolina and NASA Langley Research Center 

<p>In its charter, the DLF states its aim as bringing "together
-- from across the nation and beyond -- digitized materials that
will be made accessible to students, scholars, and citizens
everywhere, and that document the building and dynamics of
America's heritage and cultures". Its progress providing the
level of interoperability envisaged in this mission statement
has, like that of the library community more generally, been
slowed by the limitations inherent in existing solutions. The <a
href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open Archives initiative</a>
promises significantly to enhance activity in this area.</p>

<p>The OAi supplies a new technical framework for accessing
networked information resources, one that adapts a harvesting
technique used by the Internet search engines. The framework
envisages data providers and service providers. A data provider
agrees to support a simple harvesting protocol and to provide
extracts of its metadata in a common, minimal-level format in
response to harvest requests. It then records information about
its collection in a shared registry. A service provider uses this
registry to locate participating data providers, and uses the
harvest protocol to collect metadata from them. The service
provider is then able to build intellectually useful services,
such as catalogs and portals to materials distributed across
multiple sites. The framework has many virtues.</p>

<ul>
<li>The effort to enable a data provider to support metadata
harvesting is reasonable compared with that required to
contribute to a union catalog or provide Z39.50 search access.
After the repository is set up, its metadata can be harvested
with relatively little intervention, providing the scalability
that library approaches have lacked. The development of both
inclusive and specialized search services is possible; in fact,
the framework encourages the development of many search services
competing in terms of functionality, audience, and business
models, thereby enriching the entire research environment.</li>

<li>The framework could be used to expose the metadata in
thousands of individual systems worldwide to central collection.
For example, comprehensive collections of Americana or GIS data
could be developed. This would make local repositories more
generally known, and more generally useful, because researchers
could search across previously unconnected materials. It would
also illuminate the "dark matter" of the Internet-material that
is hard or impossible to find if the user does not already know
where it exists. The harvesting services that could be developed
are, in fact, limited only by need and ingenuity.</li>

<li>The academic community could begin to ensure that services
would be developed that express the values of that
community-services that center on materials of research and
educational interest, that provide honest and transparent ranking
and retrieval, and that improve search quality by intelligently
integrating metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this session, speakers will outline recent developments
within the OAi (now supported jointly by the DLF and the <a
href="http://www.cni.org">Coalition for Networked
Information</a>), introduce the technical framework, and
demonstrate its potential for digital library and other
communities that are interested in the open interchange of
scholarly information.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Gerry Bernbom</b>, Director for
Research and Academic Computing, University Information
Technology Services, Indiana University<br />
 <b>Jon W. Dunn</b>, Assistant Director for Technology, Digital
Library Program, Indiana University 

<p>Indiana University is launching a four-year initiative to
establish a Digital Music Library (DML) testbed, to develop
applications for education and research in the field of music,
and to conduct digital library research in the areas of
instruction, usability, and intellectual property rights. Through
this collaborative project, involving information technology
specialists, researchers, librarians, and music experts, IU will
develop software tools and applications to support music
teaching, learning, and research.</p>

<p>The DML will provide access to a collection of music in
several formats from a range of musical styles. The collection
will include sound recordings of musical performances; images of
published scores; encoded score notation files; MIDI format files
for audio playback; and active links that connect a musical work
in one format to a representation in a different format.</p>

<p>The DML will provide integrated multimedia library services
including search, retrieval and synchronized playback of recorded
music, MIDI files and encoded music notation files; navigation
within individual recordings or other music representations;
access control, authentication, and metadata for rights
management.</p>

<p>The DML will also provide a framework for developing software
that integrates the collections of the DML into applications for
teaching and research in the field of music.</p>

<p>Digital library research will be coordinated so that research
outcomes will be incorporated in testbed and application
development activities. Usability research will be integral to
creation of the DML and will be incorporated in the design
process. Copyright research will help identify content for
inclusion in the DML by defining categories of works that are in
the public domain, identifying alternatives for providing access
to protected works, and helping specify system design features
that may satisfy access restriction requirements.</p>

<p>Participating with Indiana University in this project are a
number of "satellite sites" at remote locations in the U.S. and
overseas, including: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Northwestern University in
the U.S.; King's College, Loughborough University, Oxford
University in the U.K.; and Waseda University in Japan.</p>

<h4><a id="fleischhauer" name="fleischhauer"></a>Planning
Audio-Visual Preservation and Access for the Library of
Congress</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Carl Fleischhauer</b>, Library
of Congress 

<p>The Library of Congress is planning a new National
Audio-Visual Conservation Center in Culpeper, Virginia, scheduled
to open in 2003. The Center will feature improved storage for the
Library's recorded sound and moving image collections, a new
nitrate film laboratory, a collections processing and cataloging
activity, and a multipurpose digital facility. The digital
facility will support the preservation of sound and video
recordings, conduct research to improve digital preservation, and
provide remote access to audio-visual collections for researchers
in the Library's Capitol Hill reading rooms.</p>

<p>Prototyping and design for the digital facility is taking
place in 2000-2002, with implementation to continue as the Center
opens and begins operation. There will be two key elements:
digital production and a repository. The production facility at
the Center will reformat existing collections and process newly
acquired audio-visual materials in digital form. In planning for
the repository, the Reference Model for Open Archival Information
Systems (OAIS) has proved helpful. The audio-visual group will
focus on the specialized functional elements of the model called
<i>ingestion</i> and <i>access</i>. Meanwhile, the project will
participate in Library-wide development of an enterprise-service
repository that will provide the <i>archival storage,
administration</i>, and <i>data management</i> functions for all
forms of digital content.</p>

<p>The Audio-Visual Prototyping Project is currently undertaking
a number feasibility tests and studies that underpin the broader
planning effort: (1) identifying computer-file formats suitable
for the preservation reformatting of recorded sound collections,
including those with visual and textual elements, (2)
experimental capture of curator-selected Web sites deemed
suitable for addition to the Library's audio-visual collections,
(3) the definition of descriptive, structural, and administrative
metadata to be captured in association with the production
process, (4) development of a preliminary methodology for the
capture of this metadata, and (5) applying an XML-based encoding
scheme to audio-visual digital archival objects. The XML scheme
being tested is the one developed for the Making of America 2
project by the University of California at Berkeley.</p>

<p>The Audio-Visual Prototyping Project is being carried out by
the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division,
supported by the National Digital Library Program and the
Preservation Directorate.</p>

<h4><a id="gustman" name="gustman"></a>The Shoah Foundation's
digital archive: A 180 Tera-Byte database for teaching
tolerance</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Sam Gustman</b>, Executive
Director of Technology, Survivors of the Shoah Visual History
Foundation 

<p>The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation (VHF) is
a non-profit institution founded by Steven Spielberg in 1994. The
goal of the VHF is to catalogue and archive video and other data
relating to historical events and to make these materials
available to museums, educational institutions and non-profit
organizations throughout the world via mass media (books, films,
CD-ROMs, etc.) and on-line, interactive networks. VHF's current
focus is to document the Holocaust, or Shoah, through first hand
testimonies of Holocaust survivors and witnesses in such a manner
that it may serve as a tool to teach the public about racial,
ethnic, and cultural tolerance.</p>

<p>As of October 2000, VHF has conducted over 51,000 interviews
in 32 languages at a cost of approximately $2,000 per interview,
including indexing and cataloging. The VHF has developed a
sophisticated system using the EMC Media Server, ADIC AML mass
storage tape library and SGI clients for storage, management, and
display of the over 180 tera-bytes of multimedia data. The VHF is
actively digitizing and indexing interviews and other materials
which are then stored and archived, all using a Digital Library
Software Architecture developed by the Foundation. The
VHF-developed database, using Sybase, permits querying by
keywords or people to retrieve and display digital segments of
video or still imagery collected from the interviews.</p>

<p>Dissemination of the archive has recently become the primary
focus of the Foundation. The Foundation has been creating
research and commercial partnerships in order to make the archive
available for use in schools, universities, libraries and other
public institutions around the world. The first research
relationship, which began in 1997, was with the Department of
Defense (DoD) through a high speed network test bed called
ATDNet. The DoD, in tandem with QWEST communications, supplied
the Foundation with OC3 ATM connections between museums in Los
Angeles and Washington D.C.. Using this test bed, the Foundation
has built systems for disseminating the archive over high speed
networks. A similar relationship is being created with Internet-2
which will enable access to the Foundation's archive at 170+
universities in the United States.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Maria Bonn</b>, Digital Library
Program Development Librarian, Digital Library Initiative,
University of Michigan 

<p>The creation and acquisition of large digital holdings as part
of our library collections has led to a need for review and
sometimes recreation of existing library policies in order to
address issues and concerns around digital materials. This talk
will look at ways in which established library principles and
policies can be extended to digital materials, at the need for
new statements of practice, and at the importance of involving
stakeholders from throughout the library community. It will focus
these issues with two example cases: the development of policy
and guidelines around digital reformatting of embrittled
originals and the development of preservation principles for
digital materials.</p>

<h4><a id="palmer" name="palmer"></a>Configuring research
collections around scholarly work</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Carole Palmer</b>, Graduate
School of Library and Information Science, University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign 

<p>Recent reports suggest that humanities scholarship is not yet
well supported by digital libraries and that future system design
should be informed by a more thorough understanding of the
practices and needs of working scholars. This paper presents
highlights from a research project that specifically addressed
this problem through a qualitative study of work processes and
technology use in the humanities. Through interviews and case
studies, we examined the information work involved in the current
research projects of a group of active humanities researchers.
The results update our understanding of the relationship between
the activities, resources, and technologies involved in scholarly
work and assess the effect that new technologies are having on
the scholarly process. While scholars are interacting with a
larger universe of materials and using some digital resources in
new and creative ways, primary source material and bibliographies
remain vital. Based on our analysis of the way scholars work and
the things that they value, we propose a series of principles and
priorities for the development of user-centered digital
collections and services.</p>

<b>Daniel Greenstein</b>, Director, Digital Library Federation 

<p>Recently the DLF has been working to reduce one of the most
substantial impediments to the development of digital archival
repositories for electronic scholarly journals -agreement about
the minimum requirements that all stakeholders (including
publishers as journal producers, libraries as journal consumers,
and scholars as journal authors and readers) will have of the
digital archival repository. Working together with CLIR and with
CNI, the DLF has developed a statement of requirement and reached
consensus about it with groups of libraries and publishers. It is
now extending its work by documenting levels of service that the
archival repository may supply. Once these service levels are
documented, they will be discussed at stakeholder workshops
convened to identify the minimum service levels that are
acceptable to all parties. With these benchmarks to hand,
libraries, publishers, and scholars can begin to have more
meaningful discussion (even negotiation) about digital
preservation. In addition, would-be digital archival repositories
will have a route map for their development and an environment of
trust that may prove essential to their long-term viability. The
session will supply an overview of the DLF's work in this area
and an early opportunity to present draft archival service levels
for public review and comment.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Kenneth Thibodeau</b>, Director,
Electronic Records Archives Program, National Archives and
Records Administration 

<p>Since 1998, the National Archives and Records Administration
launched a number of research and development projects addressing
the challenges posed by the need to preserve and deliver ever
increasing numbers and varieties of electronic records. These
initiatives aim at bringing high performance, advanced
computational capabilities to ensure the integral preservation of
complex collections of electronic records indefinitely into the
future. NARA is seeking solutions which not only overcome
problems of technology obsolescence, but also enable both
repositories and their customers to take advantage of continuing
technological progess for information discovery, retrieval and
delivery. These efforts are looking at technologies that are seen
as key to the next generation national information infrastructure
as the foundation for the development of a knowledge-based
persistent object preservation method applicable to digital
libraries, data centers, and a variety of business operations as
well as archives. NARA is pursuing these goals through several
multi-disciplinary, international research and development
collaborations. Among others, NARA is a major sponsor of the
International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in
Electronic Systems (InterPARES) project. NARA has also become a
co-sponsor, with the National Science Foundation, of the National

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>John Mark Ockerbloom</b>, University of Pennsylvania
Library<br />
<b>Mike Winkler</b>, University of Pennsylvania Library</p>

<p>Millions of dollars spent on library resources can still be
worthless if users cannot find the resources they need.
Unfortunately, the digital and print resources of libraries are
often over-compartmentalized, with print resources handled
separately from digital resources, and digital resources
organized by inflexible hierarchies and divisions that
effectively hide from users many of the resources that would be
useful to them.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will describe how we've addressed this
problem in Penn's library. We are building tools and
organizational structures to make materials easier to find, such
as web-accessible, multidimensional databases of our resources,
and "communities of interest" that serve as cross-format,
research-oriented starting points for finding materials. We will
show the tools we have built and are developing, and describe how
we are designing our digital library architecture to support
dynamic organizations of library resources that adapt to the
needs of different users and groups.</p>

Texas at Austin<br />
 <b>Fred Gilmore</b>, Senior Operating Systems Specialist,
Digital Library Services Division, The General Libraries,
University of Texas at Austin 

<p>The University of Texas at Austin General Libraries is
proceeding with a project to create an interim system to manage
its burgeoning electronic resources, including e-journals. The
presentation will provide some background illustration of the
current problems being faced, the various methods by which staff
have attempted to deal with them, and the current project that
will hopefully bring a unified, albeit temporary, solution to the
problem.</p>

<p>Many libraries are adding ever-increasing numbers of
electronic resources to their holdings. Since most "home grown"
and commercial library automation environments have been
engineered to manage print-based collections there are often many
problems associated with the "handling" of these materials. At UT
Austin, the process of managing access to these resources
involves static and database-driven web pages, our OPAC, and our
acquisitions system. This creates multiple points of management
for catalogers, library web managers, serials coordinators, and
anyone else involved in providing access to electronic
resources.</p>

<p>Local cataloging procedures include editing local MARC records
with URL's as well as downloading and editing OCLC MARC records
where no local one can be assigned. An additional procedure
undertaken by our collections officers calls for maintaining
several sets of web pages with links to the same resources as are
found in our OPAC. As these web pages cannot be generated
directly from the OPAC information, separate databases are
maintained in order to produce these web pages as well as to
track the license requirements for each individual product. Yet a
third procedure involves the maintenance of a finding tool (yet
another database listing the individual titles found in the full
text electronic resources) by the reference staff.</p>

<p>The proposed solution is to develop a unified electronic
resources management system to obviate and somewhat automate the
need for updating several separate databases as well as
responding to the need for access to these services from multiple
locations. This system will prove useful, even if only used
temporarily to bridge the gap until vendors respond adequately to
this need. With a small extension, the same system can provide

<h4>A Prototype for a Digital Object Repository</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b><a id="staples"

Development, University of Virginia</a></b> 

<p>After investigating existing digital library "solutions", the
University of Virginia Library ascertained that an appropriate
system did not yet exist. We decided to start building a system
that would fit our needs and a vendor would come (you remember
that movie, don't you?) to take over the development of a
complete, manageable product. We are definitely not interested in
being a vendor ourselves. We believe that we have completed the
first phase of this process on both fronts. We have implemented
the FEDORA architecture, developed by the Digital Library
Research Group at Cornell, using an SQL database. We have built
the system and have implemented a testbed of about 30,000 objects
at this point, including digital images, electronic texts,
electronic finding aids, and XML-encoded structural metadata
objects that organize collections of art, archeology and
architecture data. We have designed, but not yet implemented,
object models for statistical and GIS datasets, and we have begun
thinking about how to include journals and databases for which we
negotiate access. To roughly scale-test the system, we added
approximately 1 million dummy objects, and were very happy with
the results. Beginning in the spring of 2000, we started
discussing our system design with SIRSI Corporation. We have
completed several rounds of discussions with the principals of
the company and we are optimistic about the possibility of
forming a development partnership with them. Our goal is to
develop a system that manages and delivers all of our digital
resources.</p>

<h4><a id="sandler" name="sandler"></a>The EEBO Text Creation
Partnership: A Digital Library Project of Historic
Proportions</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Mark Sandler</b>, Collection
Development Officer, University of Michigan University Library 

<p>The University of Michigan, Oxford University, and the Council
on Library and Information Resources have encouraged the research
library community to fund creation of structured SGML/XML
text-files for a significant portion of the Early English Books
Online (EEBO) corpus of digital images created by Bell &amp;
Howell Information and Learning. These full-text editions, linked
to the corresponding digital facsimiles of the works, will enable
word or phrase searching across the corpus, significantly
extending intellectual access to the content and making possible
new avenues of historical research across a broad range of
disciplines. The significance of the EEBO corpus (English
language works--as well as those in other languages printed in
England--from 1475-1700), along with the scale of the digital
conversion in both image and text, make this the most ambitious
conversion effort undertaken to date. The EEBO-Text Creation
Partnership (EEBO-TCP) was proposed as the best means of
addressing the following goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>To accelerate the conversion of the STC collection from image
only to an image and text format</li>

<li>To provide participating institutions with direct input into
the selection of the works to be converted</li>

<li>To give each participating institution joint ownership of the
converted text and robust rights for access, adaptation and
distribution.</li>

<li>To assist leading research libraries develop technical
capacity and funding models that advance the creation of locally
managed digital libraries</li>

<li>To demonstrate that the necessity for commercial publishers
to make a profit can coexist with the charter of research
libraries to extend access to culturally significant
resources</li>
</ul>

<p>This paper traces the development of this groundbreaking
project, with particular emphasis placed on the nature of the
business and marketing plan and the likelihood that EEBO will
become a model for future commercial efforts to digitize
large-scale corpora in cooperation with the library
community.</p>

Fiction Project</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Perry Willett</b>, Librarian for
English and American Literature, Head, Library Electronic Text
Resource Service (LETRS), Indiana University 

<p>The CIC Wright American Fiction project is sponsored by nine
member institutions of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation
(CIC)*. This project will digitize almost 3,000 American novels
from the years 1851-1875, as described in Lyle Wright's
bibliography _American Fiction 1851-1875_. The participants will
pay collectively for digitizing the page images from microfilm,
with Indiana University converting the page images to text files
using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software and creating a
searchable database similar to the Making of America
collection.</p>

<p>Starting this fall, staff at participating libraries will
begin the work of proofreading, editing and encoding the
approximately 1,000,000 pages in the collection. We hope to
achieve cooperatively the creation of a very large, consistently
encoded textbase. To this end, we have developed encoding
guidelines and held training workshops for participants. It is
projected that this project will take three years. We hope to
accomplish three goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a significant digital collection of 19th century
American fiction;</li>

<li>Spread expertise in the creation and encoding of electronic
text among the participating libraries; and</li>

<li>Explore the issues involved in the cooperative creation of
digital collections across a wide range of institutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>* Participating CIC libraries include Indiana University,
Michigan State University, The Ohio State University,
Pennsylvania State University, University of Illinois at Chicago,
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Iowa,
University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, University of
Wisconsin</p>

<p>Overview and discussion of key elements of the Collaborative
Digital Reference Service (CDRS) a project being launched by the
Library of Congress and member libraries to provide professional
reference and research services to researchers any time anywhere,
via an international, digital network of libraries and related
institutions. The service will use new technologies to provide
the best answers in the best context, by taking advantage not
only of the millions of Internet resources but also of the many
more millions of resources that are not online and that are held
by libraries around the world. CDRS supports libraries by
providing them additional choices for the services they offer
their end users. Libraries will assist their users by connecting
to the CDRS to send questions that are best answered by the
expert staff and collections of CDRS member institutions from
around the world. Local, regional, national, and global: the
library tradition of value-added service will be the CDRS
hallmark.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the California Digital Library
has made virtual collection development a priority for the Online
Archive of California. A statewide digital resource, the OAC
integrates into a single, searchable database, finding aids to
and digital facsimiles of the contents of primary resource
collections throughout California. In this session, we will
explore the lessons learned and consider the challenges ahead by
reflecting on several OAC grant funded projects including the
UC-EAD project, the Museum Online Archive of California, the
Japanese-American Relocation Digital Archive, and the California
Cultures project. We will specifically discuss collection
development strategies, project leadership, selection mechanisms
for primary content, and compliance with metadata and imaging
standards with an eye to statewide collection building within a
collaborative framework.</p>

<h4><a id="lloyd" name="lloyd"></a>Southeastern Native American
Documents, 1730-1842</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Jim Lloyd</b>, University of
Tennessee 

<p>In 1999 the University of Georgia Libraries, and the
University of Tennessee Library were awarded a one-year National
Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library
Services to digitize 1,000 original documents and visual images
relating to the Native American population of the Southeastern
United States. These documents and images were selected from the
most significant holdings at the two universities and from the
Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee and the
Tennessee State Library and Archives in Nashville. The original
documents reside in many separate manuscript collections within
participating institutions, but as digital entities they are
being brought together into a single electronic collection. In
September of 2000 the universities were awarded a one-year
extension of funding by IMLS, in which they will digitize another
1000 documents and visual images from their collections, from the
collections of the participants in the first grant, and from the
Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina, and
the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. The final product will
be a database of facsimile images and transcribed texts,
individually cataloged and full-text searchable, mounted on
GALILEO (Georgia Library Learning Online). The database will be
free and available to the general public, but the primary
audience is K-12 teachers, who can search, download, print, and
make lesson plans as desired. A prototype database should be
available by November of 2000.</p>

<h4><a id="prom" name="prom"></a>The EAD Codebook and Ebind: A
Cost-Effective Model for Digitization</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Christopher Prom</b>, Assistant
University Archivist and Assistant Professor, University of
Illinois Archives 

<p>Books are easy! Ninety-five percent of them exist in multiple
copies and are now easily accessible through international
databases such as RLIN. It is the scholarly resources hidden in
archives that we need to make more visible. (David Stam, Syracuse
University Librarian emeritus <a
href="http://www.rlg.org/arr/">http://www.rlg.org/arr/</a>).</p>

<p>For archives, manuscript repositories and libraries holding
unique materials, digitization offers a promising means to expand
access and reach new users. However, most digitization projects
(particularly those involving scanning or mounting of images or
full text) are expensive and technically complex. Consequently,
large scale-digitization using professional standards seems out
of reach for many smaller institutions, and even for larger ones
that face budgetary pressures.</p>

<p>This paper will report the early results of a project at the
University of Illinois Archives to construct a cost-effective
digitization model for the James B. Reston Papers using
professional metadata standards (the Encoded Archival Description
XML mark-up language and an XML "page turner" called Ebind) and
other open-source or low-cost tools. It is intended that all of
the tools developed for this project will be made freely
available by the time of project completion. They could easily by
adopted by other institutions with very little modification and
by archivists or librarians with little or no technical expertise
in programming, web-site creation, or database management.</p>

<p>After reviewing the provenance and significance of the Reston
Papers and the history project, this paper will:</p>

<ol>
<li>describe and summarize the process of hardware and software
selection, program development, computer coding, selection
standards (for digital objects), and workflow design.</li>

<li>Provide a practical review of the tools and workflow used in
the project, including the XML technologies and software such as
WordPerfect's XML editor, NoteTab Light.</li>

<li>Give early results from cost studies analyzing project
workflow before and after redesign for efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p>In sum, this paper is intended to shed light on practical
elements of policy decisions regarding a hybrid collection,
especially in the area of selection and resource allocation.</p>

<h4><a id="beebe" name="beebe"></a>Digital Media Collections
Framework at NCSU Libraries</h4>

<p>The Digital Library Initiatives Department at NCSU Libraries
is developing a <i>Digital Media Collections Framework</i>to
address and enable the creation of desktop-to-enterprise
collection databases by university students, faculty, and staff.
The Libraries understands the inherent value and requirements of
a database as an information access and management tool. As the
demand and desire grows to build personal research, departmental,
or university digital collections, this tool can provide a level
of service to the university community that recently only
happened within the one-to-one service model. Developed as a
result of interviews and on-going projects with university
faculty and partner agencies, the <i>Digital Media Collections
Framework</i> organizes database product research with the
additional goal of sharing federated collections with
constituents of the NCSU digital environment.</p>

<p>The strategic foundation of the <i>Digital Media Collections
Framework</i> is the sharable Desktop Database model. Five
component parts are being developed within this model: Media
Description Framework, Media Guidelines, Database and Query
Template, Vocabulary Control application, and Media File Naming
and Directory Structure Guidelines. During the presentation, the
component parts will be described and a current test case will be
demonstrated.</p>

<h4><a id="ruotolo" name="ruotolo"></a>Experimenting with
e-books</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Christine Ruotolo</b>, Associate
Director, Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library 

<p>There's been tremendous buzz about ebooks over the past year,
but even the most ardent enthusiasts are lamenting the lack of
available ebook content. The DLF libraries can play a big role in
filling that content gap, as much of their digital content can be
converted quickly and easily for delivery to multiple ebook
platforms. The University of Virginia's Electronic Text Center
has plunged into the ebook fray headfirst, converting over a
thousand SGML-encoded texts to the OEB format and delivering them
over the web as freely-accessible Microsoft Reader .lit files
(with several additional formats forthcoming). These ebooks have
been quite a success -- over 300,000 books were downloaded in the
first 50 days of availability -- and have clearly expanded the
audience for our existing collections.</p>

<p>This presentation will describe our experiments in building an
ebook library at Virginia: our selection criteria, our methods of
conversion, the technical barriers we encountered, and the
statistics and user feedback that we are continuing to gather. It
will also discuss the ways in which currently evolving ebook
standards have ignored some issues of importance to the academic
community, and will stress the need for research libraries to get
involved in these standards efforts while they can still make a
difference.</p>

<p>The DLF is involved in research and development work in six
program areas briefly identified as digital library
architectures, collections, standards and best practices, use,
preservation, and institutional policies and strategies. It is
acting as a catalyst in the development of innovative digital
library collections and services. Lastly, it is developing a
communications arm that will help professional staff at member
institutions to share information about and keep up-to-date with
digital library developments as they occur. The presentation will
review the work of the DLF since the Forum last met in March 2000
and seek input from participants about directions the
organization should try in the coming months.</p>
