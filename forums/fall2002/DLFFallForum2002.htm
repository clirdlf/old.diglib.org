<blockquote><b>Denise Troll Covey, Carnegie Mellon University: <a href="presentations/troll-2002-11.pdf">"Filling the Gap Between Vendor and User Practice."
</a></b>

<blockquote>
Results from ARL's LIBQUAL+ project indicate that personal control is a 
high priority for library users, but that users are not very 
satisfied with the ease of remote access to library resources. 
This gap between user preferences and the level of 
service they perceive their library providing is exacerbated by the 
gap between the way commercial vendors restrict access to library 
resources and the way users access those resources.  Restricting 
access by institutional IP address creates problems for the 
increasing number of institution-affiliated users using computers 
that do not have an institution-affiliated IP address.  The Council 
on Library and Information Resources recently sponsored a survey of 
how academic libraries are supporting remote access from 
non-institution-affiliated IP addresses, the problems and costs 
associated with this effort, and their level of satisfaction with 
the technology they've implemented.  Preliminary results reveal 
that libraries are using proxy servers and (to a lesser extent) 
virtual private networks to fill the gap between vendor and user 
practice, but that these solutions can be expensive and 
unsatisfactory.  Proxy servers appear to be more problematic than 
VPNs, but both technologies lower user satisfaction, service 
quality, and staff morale; cause delays in other projects; and have 
a detrimental impact on the allocation of resources.  Moving to a 
new solution, however, will require time, money, proof of adoption 
by many vendors, and sufficient confidence that the new technology 
will be superior to the old and that the transition will be rapid 
and transparent to users.

<a href="presentations/beshears-2002-11.pdf">"Learning Technology Application Infrastructure and Interoperability Standards."
</a></b>

<blockquote>
Interoperability among system software components and online learning 
content is key to the successful implementation of a campus software 
architecture, and several learning-technology standards are being promoted 
to help schools achieve this objective.

The purpose of the first half of this presentation is to give the library 
community a conceptual model of the different services educational 
technologies provide and how they can be integrated into an overall campus 
software architecture.

The second half of the presentation will provide a basic understanding of 
the main learning technology standards that pertain to higher education, 
the key organizations involved in developing the standards, and the 
objectives they seek to achieve.

UC Berkeley has been an active participant in IMS, one of the major 
learning-technology standards-setting efforts. Fred Beshears served as the 
UC System's representative to the IMS technical board for two years 
starting in 1998, and he has been UC Berkeley's representative to IMS 
since the end of 1999. Fred is also Berkeley's liason with the Open 
Knowledge Initiative.

<blockquote><b>Abby Smith, Council on Library and Information Resources: "LC report to Congress."</b>
<blockquote>
In December 2000, the United States Congress passed legislation establishing the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation 
Program (NDIIPP). It charges the Librarian of Congress to lead a nationwide planning effort for the long-term preservation of digital content. 
The goal of the plan for digital preservation is to encourage shared responsibility for digital content and to seek national solutions for: 

<ul>
<li> the continuing collection, selection, and organization of the most historically significant cultural materials and of other important information resources, regardless of evolving formats </li>
<li> the long-term storage, preservation, and authenticity of those collections</li>
<li> persistent, rights-protected access for the public to the growing digital historical record and information resources of the American people.</li>
</ul>

The process began with a year-long, nationwide, fact-finding effort and initial planning. Next, with Congressional approval, NDIIPP will invest 
in a set of activities proposed under the plan that include practical applications and modeling of key components of the infrastructure; 
developing core capacities for the preservation network; building a digital preservation architecture; and conducting targeted basic research 
needed for the management of digital content and of the systems that support it. These investments will both leverage the knowledge gained by 
a range of preservation stakeholders and broaden their participation in network building.
<br />
<br />
Abby Smith will report on the results of the planning phase and the recommendations made to Congress this fall for implementation of the plan.<br />

understanding and use of the OAI PMH for harvesting and other associated 
scholarly services.  
<br />
Speakers will review the goals of the Mellon program, and discuss findings concerning core OAI technologies, such as best practices in creating 
OAI metadata providers and harvesting tools created during the projects.

 In the last few years many of the digitization projects in the community  
have focused on capturing and bringing together surrogates of cultural  
resources. These projects are at various stages of maturity and reflect  
various approaches to the range of challenges inherent in the aggregation  
of digitized materials. With this body of pooled collections, now may be a  
good time to reflect on the benefits of the various approaches.  Some are  
distributed; others are centralized; while others use a combined approach.  
But in each case, the goal is to improve access to collections that are of  
interest to researchers and educators.
<br />                   
This session will provide an opportunity for demonstrations and discussion  
on some of the persistent issues that continue to confront these effort,
such as:          
 <ul>                  
 <li>Promoting Use -- What is being done to increase awareness of the  resource, 
how can researchers access it, what is being done to enable use  of the content 
with courseware or in classrooms and projects, and are other
 uses allowed?     
     </li>              
<li> Rights Management -- What materials are included, how are they protected, and  
what agreements are in place between the project and the content owners  and 
between the project and the users?
         </li>          
 <li>Technical Integration -- Is the content centralized or distributed, how  
are metadata in a variety of formats and from a variety of sources made  
meaningful to users, and how are digital files that were created in a variety  
of ways presented to users?
             </li>      
 <li>Sustainability -- What will happen when project funding is discontinued,  
how will the resource be kept alive and continue to grow, and how are the  
materials being preserved for the future?</li>

involved in the acquisition, conversion, and dissemination of digital content.
<br />
Three projects will be used as case studies: the 1500 University of California 
Press titles that eScholarship is converting from netLibrary XHTML files into 
XML ebooks; the eScholarship Repository, an institutionally based repository for 
pre-publication scholarship in all disciplines; and the Handbook of Visual Optics, 
a reference work that will appear in both digital and print forms from a 
collaboration among CDL, UC Press, and the Optical Society of America.
<br />
Programmatic topics will include challenges to 2 and 3-way partnerships (across 
libraries, university presses, and scientific societies); collections issues of 
university-specific access vs. global access; and institutional vs. subject or 
faculty-based repository arrangements. Technical topics will include the conversion 
of incoming objects to METS; automatic conversion and merging of metadata from 
MARC; a processing database to MODS and to DC; exposing results through 
OAI; tools for authoring and publishing; and strategies for searching XML-encoded 
texts.

<blockquote><b>Thornton Staples, University of Virginia: "Report on the 'Supporting Digital Scholarship' Project."</b>
<blockquote>
The Supporting Digital Scholarship project is a joint project between the Instititute 
for Advanced Technology in the Humanities and the University of Virginia Library to 
investigate the implications of collecting digital scholarly projects into a 
digital library. This project, now in its third and final year, was funded by a 
grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Our experience at the University of 
Virginia has been that scholars, given the resources and the support needed, 
are creating digital projects that are more like virtual museum exhibitions 
than like books. These projects usually include large collections of digital 
versions of primary resources with a network of complex interrelationships 
interwoven with original scholarly commentary. This report will discuss the 
technical problems that we have encountered in collecting the Rossetti 
Archive (<a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/rossetti/">

<blockquote><b>Rebecca Guenther, Library of Congress; Kirk Hastings, University of California; 
Mary Alice Ball, University of Chicago Press:  
"Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS): An overview of its uses, features, and current experimentation."</b>

<blockquote>
This session will consist of several presentations on MODS, a new bibliographic element set based on MARC and represented as an XML schema.  MODS has been developed by the Library of Congress with interested parties as a rich element set that is a subset of MARC, using XML with language based tags.  Potential uses include, among others, use as a specified format for Z39.50 Next Generation, as an extension schema to METS, to represent metadata for harvesting from databases, and as a simplified record in XML that is compatible with existing library data.
<br />
Part I. Development of DC-Lib Application Profile:
as background to understanding the development of MODS,  there will be an introduction to the reasons for developing the Dublin Core-Library Application Profile, what it attempts to accomplish, and its current status. 
Implementation for this profile may be touched on briefly, 
and simple Dublin Core will be addressed as discussed below.
<br />

Part II. Introduction to MODS
An overview of the reasons for developing MODS, an introduction to the element set, and a summary of potential uses.  The simple Dublin Core element set will be contrasted to MODS in terms of the details in the element sets, and some reasons for using MODS rather than simple Dublin Core.  (Speaker: Rebecca Guenther)
<br />
 Part III.  Descriptions of MODS experimentation, including:

<ul>
 <li> University of California project using METS with MODS as  descriptive metadata to support a search/browse interface (Speaker: Kirk
 Hastings)</li>
  <li> University of Chicago Press project using MODS to enhance  electronic document searchability and distribution  (Speaker: Mary Alice

What role can and should libraries play in the future of the university? 
Much of the focus today has been on scholarly publishing and information 
organization and delivery. The speaker will argue that publication and 
information (or knowledge) production are only part of the story, and 
that the library, especially at this time of growing "virtuality," 
carries and symbolizes other values and modes of being that are 
essential for the future of education.

<blockquote><b>Caroline Arms, Library of Congress: <a href="presentations/arms-2002-11.pdf">"Implementing the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting at the Library of Congress."
</a></b>
<blockquote>The Library of Congress has participated in the development of the 
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting since the first meeting 
in Santa Fe.  LC joined the technical discussions and tests before the release of 
the first and second public versions.  Released this June, version 2 includes a 
recommendation that harvesting of MARC records be based on a new, "slim" XML Schema 
for MARC21 maintained by LC's Network Development and MARC Standards Office 
(NDMSO).  Over 100,000 metadata records for items digitized for American Memory 
are now available for harvesting.  Items represented include books, maps, photographs, early movies, sheet music, and printed ephemera.  Records for more 
content that LC can share freely will be added steadily.  Several organizations 
building union resources of cultural heritage materials, including DLF members 
funded by the Mellon Foundation, have harvested the records.  The records are 
available in MARC and unqualified Dublin Core, with MODS to be available soon.  
Metadata crosswalks and character set mappings developed by NDMSO made it easy 
to implement the straightforward protocol as an add-on to American Memory.  The 
requirements for supporting the protocol have induced discipline and consistency 
with long-term local benefits and provided test cases for handling special 
characters in UNICODE.  Two specialist gateways in the planning stages, for 
movies and sheet music, expect to harvest records for particular collections.  
Other collaborations in which LC is involved also plan to make use of the 
protocol.  LC has found it valuable to participate in the experimental phase 
of this contribution to the toolkit for collaboration.

<blockquote><b>John Walsh, Indiana University: "Unicode Ate My Brain: The Trials and Tribulations of Implementing a Unicode-Dependent Digital Library Project."
</b><blockquote>
The speaker will discuss the various challenges and problems raised in 
implementing a digital library project dependent upon Unicode data.  During the 
past two years Indiana University's Digital Library Program has been working on a 
project--funded by a grant from the Technological Innovation and Cooperation for 
Foreign Information Access (TICFIA) program of the U.S. Department of Education--
to digitize and make available on the Web a twenty-year run
(1956-1975) of the <i>Letopis Zhurnal'nykh Statei</i>, a Russian/Soviet periodical 
index covering virtually all disciplines.  The language of the index is Russian 
and uses the Cyrillic alphabet but includes other languages and scripts as well, 
including English, French, German, and Greek.  This combination of languages and 
scripts necessitates the use of Unicode in the digitized version of the index.  
A Web-based digital library project that is dependent upon Unicode poses a number 
of challenges and requirements, including full Unicode support in the programming 
languages and other technologies used to implement the project.  There are also 
special considerations and problems regarding fonts, browsers, display of 
right-to-left languages, and user input. Using the <i>Letopis Zhurnal'nykh Statei </i> 
project and other Indiana University projects as examples, the speaker will discuss these 
and other challenges presented in working with Unicode data and some of the 
solutions devised to address them.

<blockquote><b>c) Developing a model and standards for agreements to
establish and document the intellectual property rights associated with 
digital projects. Joyce L. Ogburn, chair. </b> <I>Chinook Room.</I>
<blockquote>

At the May 2002 DLF Spring Forum, a Birds of a Feather session addressed the 
need for standardizing agreements to establish and 
document the intellectual property rights associated with digital projects. 
The initial proposal stated that we should cooperate in drafting model 
licenses that support the rights for libraries to create or host digital 
content in the same way that we banded together to understand terms and 
build model licenses for licensing content from commercial suppliers. 
The attendees agreed that the session was an invaluable start in exploring 
the issues and identifying some concrete actions. This session will build 
on the previous one and go further in outlining steps for developing 
a model and standards. It will also explore the possibility of linking 
this effort with those focused on management systems and metadata for 
electronic resources.

<blockquote><b>d) Humanities computing centers in libraries. Jennifer Vinopal, chair.
</b> <I>Taku Room.</I>
<blockquote>
More and more academic libraries, either by themselves or collaboratively, are 
creating services to encourage and support humanists' use of computing technology for scholarly purposes. These services may be offered within a 
dedicated Humanities Computing Center, or may be an outgrowth of pre-existing facilities 
(computer lab, e-text center, etc.). In this informal discussion, participants will 
share experiences and explore issues related to libraries' provision of humanities 
computing services in such facilities. Possible discussion topics include:
<ul>
<li> staffing and staff training</li>
<li> collaboration with other departments, units, or academic divisions</li>
<li> marketing your service and building your clientele</li>
<li> budgeting time and money</li>
<li> growing the service along with user demand</li>
<li> project support (staffing, funding, etc.)</li>
</ul>

One possible outcome of this session may be to create a forum, either 
informal or formal, in which participants can continue sharing ideas after 
the conference.

<blockquote><b>e) Multilingual data and the Digital Library. Eileen Llona, chair.</b>
<I>Makani Room.</I>
<blockquote>

Much of the information that academic libraries hold is multilingual 
in format. Making these data available to digital library systems involves 
several considerations, and often several systems. Digitizing text involves 
OCR if the text is to be searchable, which often raises language support 
issues for non-Roman languages. Storing digital data from scratch in non-Roman 
languages requires specialized software. Combining the richness of mutlilingual 
information into one system presents challenges for interface design and 
back-end systems. The University of Washington has been actively creating new 
digital resources involving non-Roman languages, and will lead a discussion of 
multilingual access in a digital library, including:
<ul>
<li>Character encoding issues in an ILS</li>
<li>Integration of multilingual data into thesauri development</li>
<li>Character encoding and font issues for integrating multiple systems involving multiple languages.</li>
</ul>
Related topics are welcome. The goal is to share experiences and solutions, and 
discuss the potential for collaboration.

Fall 2000 DLF Forum.  Since that time, much work has transpired, and version 
1.0 of the Variations2 system was recently completed, offering integrated 
access to sound recordings and musical score images through a Java-based client 
application and back-end server, and utilizing a data model and metadata scheme 
based in part on IFLA's Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) 
work to offer enhanced capabilities for finding and retrieving musical content.
<br />
In this presentation, Variations2 version 1.0 will be described and demonstrated, 
including discussion of the technical architecture, data/metadata model, and user 
interfaces for search and navigation.  The relationship between the Variations2 
data model representation and METS (Multimedia Encoding and Transmission Standard) 
will be discussed.  In addition, the status of current work on multi-format 
synchronization, support for music notation file formats, and integration of 
digital music collections and services into instructional applications will be 
presented.

<blockquote><b>David Fielding, Cornell University: "D-Pubs, Project Euclid, and OAI Compliance."
</b>
<blockquote>The Digital Publishing System (D-PubS) is being developed at Cornell 
University for Project Euclid (<a href="http://ProjectEuclid.org">http://ProjectEuclid.org</a>), with support from The 
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Project Euclid strives to facilitate affordable 
scholarly communications in the fields of mathematics and statistics.  D-PubS is 
the modular software architecture developed for Project Euclid. We have extended 
and generalized the original system developed for Project Euclid to support a 
broad variety of digital collections, including the Cornell University Library 
Technical Reports and Papers collection and the Historical Mathematics Book 
collection. D-PubS consists of a set of configurable services that may vary 
depending on the functionality desired for a specific collection. D-PubS services 
include a repository service, index and search service, user interface service, 
pay-per-view service, subscription service, registry service, editorial workspace 
service, and a moderated submission service. A peer-review service is planned. 
In attempting to follow standards, D-PubS currently supports the Open Archives 
Initiative (OAI) metadata harvesting protocol and we are planning to adopt the 
design guidelines of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model. 
The speaker will give an overview of the D-PubS system and discuss our experiences 
implementing the open archives protocol along with our plans to develop and/or 
integrate advanced OAI services into the D-Pubs system.

<blockquote><b>Oya Y. Rieger (Cornell), 
"Integrating Digital Libraries with Virtual Learning Environments."
</b><blockquote>
One of the challenges we are facing is how to achieve the seamless integration of digital 
libraries in learning management environments.  This presentation will focus 
on Cornell University Library's approach in building a service infrastructure and 
forging alliances with key stakeholders to ensure the incorporation of digital 
library resources and services in virtual learning environments. 
<br />
As manifested by the increasing number of course Websites and online course 
modules, faculty are making significant use of information technologies in support 
of teaching, learning, and research.  The goal of the presentation is to 
share strategies developed by the Cornell University Library (CUL) to support 
faculty initiatives in technology-rich environments.  These programs are 
collaborative in nature and bring together several campus service providers to 
create a seamless support framework for technology-mediated learning.  
The presentation will highlight two tracks of the CUL's distributed learning 
strategy:  the Unified Service Working Group and Digital Consulting and 
Production Services.  
<br />
Co-managed by the CUL, the Unified Service Working Group is a campus-wide 
initiative to coordinate service access for faculty interested in using 
various distributed learning technologies.  As distributed learning services 
proliferate, the faculty needs systematic assistance in identifying relevant 
resources and services in support of their specific projects.  
<br />
The goal of the CUL's new Digital Consulting and Production Services (D-CAPS) 
is to offer a suite of digital asset production and management services to the 
campus community, including unit libraries, faculty, and administration.  D-CAPS is 
comprised of associated services necessary to ensure cost-effective planning, 
creation, management, use, and preservation for digital collections.  D-CAPS 
consults in the areas of digitization, copyright, metadata, technology, digital 
preservation, and digital asset management. 
<br />
As illustrated by these examples, integrating digital libraries in learning 
management environments requires the development of a collaborative service 
infrastructure.  The presentation will focus on CUL's approaches in building 
this framework.

<blockquote><b>Cathy Marshall, Microsoft Research: Reading in the Digital Library: Experiences with E-books in Education   </b>
<blockquote>
Digital libraries are delivering on the promise of anytime, anywhere access to 
educational materials. But how will students read these materials? 
Are e-books the answer? In this talk, the speaker will discuss implications of the results of several studies of reading, reading technologies, and the use of digital library materials both in and out of the classroom.

<blockquote><b>Peter Brantley (NYU), Access management: Shibboleth introduction; 
Scott Cantor (OSU), and Oliver Pesch (EBSCO): Shibboleth implementation issues</b>

<blockquote>
The Internet2-backed Shibboleth middleware initiative has progressed
rapidly in the last six months.  Initial production code is slated to
be released in late October as part of the NMI Release2 package.
Significant new vendor support has been announced, and exciting
integration work is underway with leading content providers and
learning management systems.<br />
<br />

The initial session will review the status of Shibboleth software and
the organic development of enhancement proposals and vendor interest
in Shibboleth compatability.  Following this introduction, Scott Cantor
will technically review Shibboleth message flow and then talk about the
implementation experience at his source site, Ohio State.  On the
target side, Oliver Pesch will discuss EBSCO's basic authentication
set-up, their incorporation of Shibboleth and its advantages to the
user community, and the issues of mapping accounts to institutions.

<blockquote><b>Michele Kimpton, "The Internet Archive -- building a digital library of creative human works -- progress and prospects."</b>
<blockquote>

The Internet Archive has been working in collaboration with numerous 
partners to put together the an ambitious digital collection of works, 
including websites, movies, animation, TV, music, and books, as a tool for 
providing universal  access to human knowledge.
 
The vision of IA is to improve access to all these materials by removing geographic, 
physical, and monetary barriers wherever possible. 

Over the last year, IA has been working in partnership with several organizations 
to help them build, store, and access such collections by providing digitizing services, unlimited disk storage and bandwidth, 
and online collecting that might otherwise be out of reach. 
The speaker will provide an overview of current IA projects and collections. 
A more in-depth discussion will be given of  
a current project to collaborate with National Libraries to archive the Web.
