	<h2>2. Registry Features</h2>


	<p>This is an aggregated list of features found in the environmental scan of tool registries.</p>


	<h3>Descriptive metadata</h3>


	<p>The two registries that do the best job of organizing information by fields are Google Projects and SourceForge. Both provide the following: description (summary), ownership/license information, source code and other downloads, category/tag. SourceForge can also stores a lot of technical information in fields like database environment, operating system, UI, programming language, and so forth.</p>


	<h3>Search</h3>


	<p>Basic support for keyword based search.  Some registries have advanced features such as search by field. Google Projects uses a label (or tag) kind of function, and one can search by label.</p>


	<h3>Browse by facet</h3>


	<p>Browse interface could include facets such Most Popular, Newly Added, Platform, Provider, Name.</p>


	<h3>Add/edit</h3>


	<p>Some registries permit additions and/or edit of registry entries using a web-based interface.</p>


	<h3>Discussion</h3>


	<p>A number of registries support a integrated discussion board or wiki allowing the user community to freely comment or share information on items in the registry.</p>


	<h3>Ratings/reputation</h3>


	<p>Some registries allow users to rate (e.g. 1-5 scale) the quality or usefulness of a tool.  This creates incentives for tool developers to share quality tools to increase their reputation.  It also helps users identify best of class tools.</p>


	<h3>Update notifications</h3>


	<p>Some registries provide a feature to &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to alerts from the developer when new versions of the tool are made available.</p>


	<h3>Usage logging</h3>


	<p>Some registries such as SourceForge track the number of downloads of a particular software.  An alterative approach would be for institutions to self-identify as users of a particular tool.</p>


	<h3>Tags</h3>


	<p>Contributor defined &#8220;tags&#8221; to help organize registry entries to promote discovery.</p>


	<h3>Web Services interface</h3>


	<p>Some registries provide an Application Programming Interface for harvesting or querying data from the registry in <span class="caps">XML</span> format.  Examples of interfaces include <span class="caps">OAI</span>-PMH and <span class="caps">SRU</span>/SRW.</p>
