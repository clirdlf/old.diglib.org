<h3><a id="register" name="register">Registration
Information</a></h3>

<p><b>Eligibility:</b> The DLF Forum is open to staff at DLF
member institutions. Although we do not wish to impose
restrictions on the number of participants from any single DLF
member, institutions wishing to send more than 4 staff members
should contact the DLF <a
href="mailto:dlf_forum@clir.org">(dlf_forum@clir.org)</a> in
advance.</p>

<p><b>Deadline for Registration: April 22, 2002.</b><br />
Eligible participants should either</p>

<ul>
<li>fill out the <a
href="http://www.clir.org/registration/2002-05-10.html">DLF Forum
registration form</a> or</li>

<li>send their names, titles, and institutional affiliations to
<a href="mailto:dlf_forum@clir.org">dlf_forum@clir.org</a>
indicating the dates they plan to attend the Forum.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cost:</b> Participants are expected to cover the costs of
their travel, room and board. No registration fee will apply and
participants will be invited to join us for a reception Friday
evening, for breakfast and lunch on Saturday, and for breakfast
on Sunday. In addition, there will be numerous breaks at which
snacks and beverages will be provided.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a id="accommodation" name="accommodation">Guest
Accommodations</a></h3>

A block of rooms has been set aside at the <a
href="http://www.wyndham.com/Chicago/default.cfm">Wyndham
Chicago</a>. Rooms can be booked at the DLF Forum rate of $149
per night provided reservations are made with the Wyndham before
<b>April 8, 2002</b> and depending on availability. Be sure to
mention the DLF Forum when making your reservations.<br />
 

<p></p>

<h3><a id="proposals" name="proposals">Proposals for papers and
panel discussions</a></h3>

<p>Staff at DLF member institutions are invited to submit
proposals for papers and panel discussions by dealing with any
aspect of digital library development.</p>

<p>At this forum, there will be a special emphasis on
interoperability - what it is, why it is significant for research
libraries and their patrons, and how it may be achieved. The
topic will be approached from all its many technological,
organizational, definitional, political and other aspects.</p>

<p>Proposals for presentations should be brief (c.250 words) and
supply a title and short abstract.</p>

<p>Proposals for panel discussions may be slightly longer. They
should supply a title for the panel discussion, briefly outline
its purpose, and supply the panelists' names alongside titles and
short descriptions for their respective contributions.</p>

<p>Proposals should be submitted by email to <a
href="mailto:dlf_forum@clir.org">dlf_forum@clir.org</a>. Please
include the phrase "forum proposal" as the subject heading in
your email.</p>

<p>Proposals must be received <b>by March 22, 2002</b> in order
to ensure consideration.</p>

<p>All conference rooms will be equipped with standard audio
facilities and an LCD overhead display.</p>

<h3><a id="birds" name="birds">Host or participate in a
"birds-of-a-feather" discussion</a></h3>

<p>As a new departure, the DLF Forum will accommodate a number of
"birds of a feather" discussions on topics that may be
recommended by participants. Such discussions may be used to
foster inter-institutional collaborations, "cook up" new DLF
initiatives, make progress with DLF initiatives already underway,
or simply share experiences in some area. Discussions will take
place at tables reserved at breakfast on Saturday and Sunday and
at Saturday lunch.</p>

<p>Those interested in hosting such discussions are asked to send
an email to <a
href="mailto:dlf_forum@clir.org">dlf_forum@clir.org</a> by
<b>April 22, 2002</b> suggesting topics. Birds-of-a-feather
discussions will be advertised in advance of the forum.</p>

<p>If you have any questions at all about the forum, please
contact <a href="mailto:dlf_forum@clir.org">Cassie Savage</a>.
