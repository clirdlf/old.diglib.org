<h2><a id="niso" name="niso">NISO/DLF Workshop 0730 -
1330</a></h2>

<p></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<div style="margin-left: 6em">On May 10, 2002 NISO and the
Digital Library Federation will co-sponsor a half-day
pre-standardization workshop to examine standards needed to
facilitate the management of electronic resources. The workshop
will be held in Chicago at the Wyndham Hotel. The workshop is
free to DLF Sponsors and NISO members. Advance registration is
required. 

<p>Why this Workshop? Libraries (particularly academic libraries)
are investing major portions of their acquisitions dollars in
electronic information resources. As these electronic collections
grow they are becoming increasingly difficult to manage and few
existing library management systems provide tools to address
contract management, umbrella subscriptions, and license terms.
For some libraries the solution is local development of new
databases.</p>

<p>At this relatively early stage NISO and DLF want to begin the
process of developing a standard set of data definitions and
common XML schema, encompassing a standard set of data elements,
names and definitions, and the semantic relationships for these
elements.</p>

<p>Who should attend: ILS vendor staff, staff involved in
electronic resource management and collection development,
serials vendors, and intermediaries.</p>

<p>Details on the Workshop, the agenda, and a registration form
are on the NISO website:</p>

http://www.niso.org/news/events_workshops/NISO-DLF-wkshp.html</a></p>

<p>Related to this Workshop event, NISO, with DLF support, is
undertaking a study to evaluate the current use and potential of
standards to facilitate the exchange of serials subscription
information for both print and electronic resources. A
questionnaire for libraries has been placed on the NISO web site:
http://www.niso.org/survey/serials.cfm. The survey will close May
30. A final report on this survey and the Workshop, including
recommendations, will be on the NISO website in June.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Henry Pisciotta</b>, VIUS
Project Coordinator, Penn State University Libraries<br />
<b>Michael Pelikan</b>, Technical Initiatives Librarian, Penn
State University Libraries 

<p>Penn State's Visual Image User Study (VIUS) is rigorously
assessing the requirements for a digital image delivery system at
this large and complex university. A broad variety of user
studies have been employed during the first 11 months of this
26-month project (including surveys sent to thousands of faculty
and students in arts, humanities, and environmental studies
disciplines, demographic data for the users of licensed image
databases, eight focus group discussions, 22 interviews, and some
analysis of transaction logs for image databases). This paper
provides a first taste of this "fresh squeezed" data. Some
findings: Throughout most of these disciplines use of pictures is
widespread and interest in digital images is intense. As with
other information services, content is the primary consideration
for users. Faculty expect that systematic image delivery will
primarily benefit their teaching (although there is an
interesting disjuncture between this expectation and the current
uses of digital images for other purposes, such as research).
Some search techniques are more associable with researchers and
independent learners than with teachers. Many teachers and a
surprising number of students maintain individual collections of
pictures for educational use. Faculty who maintain large picture
collections are more likely to use other collections than those
who maintain small collections. Users want to be able to easily
mix "their" pictures with those supplied by a delivery system.
Although users want good retrieval tools and good presentation
tools, they do not necessarily want these to be combined in the
same system. The support for these and other findings will be
described.</p>

<p><b><a id="white" name="white">QuestionPoint</a>: Local touch
with a global reach</b></p>

<p></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">

<p><b>Linda J. White</b>, Digital Project Coordinator, Library of
Congress</p>

<p>Advances in technology are bringing about a redefinition of
the nature of reference services. Trends indicate that patrons
are going online for their information needs, challenging
librarians to harness new tools to meet patrons at their point of
need. One solution for creating and maintaining a digital
reference service is QuestionPoint. Begun as a pilot project,
QuestionPoint (formerly the Collaborative Digital Reference
Service) has matured and moved to a new level of service. The
partnership of libraries, Library of Congress and OCLC has
allowed the service to build the next generation of collaborative
reference tools, providing new functionality such as: a "local"
component designed to manage and implement traditional and
electronic reference services; chat software; tracking and
reporting tools; technical support; standards-based advocacy; and
seamless escalation to a global network of online librarians, to
provide access to collections and subject experts.</p>

<p>The hallmark of QuestionPoint is migrating the traditional
skills of librarianship (reference interviews, controlled
vocabularies and source citations, networks and access to online
and print resources) to the online environment; to meet patrons'
needs in a global community and thereby redefine public
service.</p>

<p>This presentation will include a live demonstration of
QuestionPoint and first person accounts by librarians using the
service in their libraries.</p>

<h3><a id="oss" name="oss">Next</a> steps for open-source
software in libraries</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p><b>Chuck Bearden</b>, Library Systems Programmer/Analyst,
Fondren Library, Rice University<br />
<b>Eric Lease Morgan,</b>, Head, Information Access and
Architecture Department, University of Notre Dame Libraries<br />
<b>Joan Frye Williams</b>, Library Consultant</p>

<p>This panel discussion includes three speakers who will address
the possible steps that need to be taken if open source software
is to become a more viable option in libraries.</p>

<p>Eric Lease Morgan of the University Libraries of Notre Dame
will provide a brief overview of what open source software is and
how it has been applied in the library community. The main points
of his presentation will be: 1) open source software is not the
modern-day 'homegrown' solution of the '70's and '80's, and 2)
open source software provides a means for libraries to exert more
control over their computer environment.</p>

<p>Chuck Bearden of Rice University is a significant contributor
to an open source software project called MARC.pm. He will
suggest ARL libraries should seriously consider the use and
support of open-source software in work and research. He thinks
so because: 1) it shares many of the same values of academia, 2)
it tends to conform to standards, 3) it can be adopted to one's
own needs, and 4) it provides an unparalleled opportunity for
self-education.</p>

<p>Joan Frye Williams, independent library consultant, will
describe from an administrative point of view what needs to
happen in order to make open source software a more viable option
in libraries. More specifically, she will describe what libraries
have to gain from open source, potential risks of this approach,
necessary steps to take and safeguards to have in place for open
source software to be used successfully in a library setting.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This session will present preliminary findings resulting from

of their overall scholarly information environment. The study is
based on an extensive survey of more than 3,200 faculty and
students at research universities and liberal arts colleges.</p>

<p>The report presents selected data gathered through the survey.
It is intended to indicate the breadth and depth of the data that
have been collected and the potential for their analysis. By
presenting selected tables and graphs and lightweight
interpretation, the document is also intended to stimulate
discussion about the data's significance and meaning, about new
and important analyses that need to be tried, and about how the
data might be reported in publication. That discussion may also
identify gaps that the dataset as collected cannot fill, and in
this respect to focus thinking about new or follow-up lines of
inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Chuck Eckman</b>, Principal Government Documents Librarian,
Stanford University Libraries<br />
<b>Stuart Snydman</b>, Digital Library Projects Manager, Stanford
University Libraries</p>

<p>The Stanford University Libraries are collaborating with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) in an effort to digitize the
complete historical record of the WTO's predecessor organization,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Stanford
archivists, technology staff and scholars have conducted
selection, digitization and metadata collection for over 2
million pages of print archival records and related documentation
at the WTO headquarters in Geneva. The large size and complexity
of the archive, coupled with the geographically remote aspect of
the operation, present significant challenges for both collection
development and technological implementation. The collection
development goal is to develop a representative digital
collection based on original print archival records, documents
and publications. In the course of identifying and incorporating
this content within the project, the team has confronted several
specific selection, access, and contractual issues. Technology
challenges include the creation of a production-level
digitization system in a remote location as well as the
development of access tools able to accommodate the requirements
of both Stanford's emerging digital library environment and the
WTO's own document management system. The content and metadata of
this collection will be the first to be incorporated within
Stanford's planned digital repository, and will constitute a test
of its ability to accommodate the idiosyncratic needs of a rare
and unique archive, while at the same time interoperating with
the digital library environment of non-academic collaborators.
The presenters will provide an overview of the project's history,
describe lessons learned, and conclude with a discussion of how
librarianship, technological innovation and diplomacy converge in
the development of the global digital library.</p>

<h4><a id="mcinerney" name="mcinerney">The</a> Tamino XML
database at Harvard University Library</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Clare McInerney</b>, Programmer/Analyst, Office for
Information Systems, Harvard University Library</p>

<p>This presentation will discuss the planned usage of the Tamino
XML database by Harvard University Library in the design of the
TED (Templated Database) system.</p>

<p>A number of catalogs have been developed at Harvard that
enable creation, maintenance, delivery, and searching of
different types of metadata about digital collections. Examples
of existing catalogs are Visual Information Access (VIA), Harvard
Geospatial Library (HGL), Online Archival Search Information
System (OASIS) and HOLLIS. There are a number of digital
collections that do not fit these existing catalogs, such as the
Milman Parry Collection and the Biomedical Image Laboratory
(BIL). The Milman Parry Collection is a collection of text and
recordings of oral literature made during 1933-1935 in
Yugoslavia, and the Biomedical Image Laboratory (BIL) will be a
central catalog of images produced in support of biomedical
research.</p>

Existing catalogs have been manually coded using relational
database models. It is very difficult to abstract metadata
dependencies out of the system design using relational database
models, especially when a collection contains a complex
hierarchy. XML technology, and XML Schema in particular, provides
a more flexible mechanism. The TED system abstracts metadata
dependencies to a template layer. This means that the TED system
takes a formal description of the metadata as input and
automatically creates a customized catalog, including a database
schema and query interface. We are using the Tamino native XML
database from Software AG to implement TED. While we are still in
the early stages of the TED project, I would like to share our
experiences so far with Tamino.</div>

<p>As digital libraries begin to build significant holdings of

instructional settings, we are beginning to see what new
challenges supporting instructional technology will bring, and
how traditional boundaries between classrooms and libraries are
beginning to blur. The scope of what we collect, the metadata we
create to manage digital collections, and the means of delivering
digital content are all affected by the requirements of
instructional technology. MIT is undertaking significant programs
in both instructional technology and digital library development,
and is investigating how these two technologies will need to
interact for digital libraries to reach their full potential in
academic research institutions. The OpenCourseWare and Open

<h4><a id="kunze" name="kunze">What</a> makes identifiers
persistent</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>John Kunze</b>, California Digital Library</p>

<p>If there's one thing that distinguishes a digital library from
a web site, it's probably reliable, long-term access to
information. An important challenge for DLF member institutions
is to address the widespread problem of broken URLs - that is,
web links that once worked to gain access to vital material, but
that now no longer work.</p>

<p>Until recently, the blame and the proposed remedies were
typically attached to the URL itself. Why couldn't this volatile
identifier be tamed by switching to indirect identifiers, just as
DNS introduced symbolic hostnames to replace those unstable
numeric IP addresses? Unfortunately, the main proposed remedies
-- URNs, DOIs, PURLs -- are predicated on the surprising
assumption that provider organizations that currently do not, for
whatever reason, maintain URL redirection tables, would suddenly,
by using different identifiers, become the kinds of organizations
that do maintain such tables.</p>

<p>The California Digital Library is taking a new approach that
treats persistence purely as a matter of service. If a
persistence claim is to be seen as credible, a provider's
identifiers will be backed up by services that take efficient,
consistent access to objects as seriously as access to object
descriptions and to statements detailing the nature of the
provider's commitments to them. Economies of scale are possible
to the extent that access methods are standardized. If
persistence is a priority, identifiers can be generated in such a
way as to avoid several common age-related disorders.</p>

<h4><a id="brantley" name="brantley">Assessing</a> Shibboleth:
Architectures, policy structures, practical technologies, and
open source implementation to support inter-institutional sharing
of web resources subject to access controls</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Peter Brantley</b>, New York University</p>

<p>Shibboleth has been proposed by Internet2 as a technology to
support inter-institutional authentication and authorization for
access to Web pages. Its intent is to support, as much as
possible, the heterogeneous security systems in use on campuses
today, including Kerberos and PKI.</p>

<p>Shibboleth is developing an architectural framework and an
associated open-source software prototype to support
inter-institutional resource sharing subject to access
restrictions. Shibboleth enables the secure exchange of
interoperable authorization information, working hand-in-hand
with existing campus-level authentication systems. Shibboleth
combines a high level of granularity over the release of user
attributes with robust logging support, meeting both academic
expectations for privacy and publisher needs for
accountability.</p>

<p>Shibboleth has reached a stable architectural stage and coding
is commencing. Recently, New York University, CNI, and the DLF
invited a cross section of academics, publishers and resource
providers to meet with Shibboleth's developers and comment on its
design and goals. This talk will report on the dominant themes of
this sponsored meeting, and present expected future directions in
Shibboleth development and deployment.</p>

Archivist, Mandeville Special Collections Library, University of
California, San Diego</p>

<p>This presentation will offer a summary of the Archivists'
Workbench meeting, but it will focus on several high-level design
criteria for an archivists' toolkit derived from that meeting.
The Archivists' Workbench meeting, sponsored by the Digital
Library Federation and the California Digital Library, took place
in La Jolla, Calif., on Februrary 3-4. It was attended by
twenty-one archivists and information technologists, all of whom
were interested in the feasibility of designing a digital toolkit
supporting archival work and capable of general deployment for
use among a wide range of archival repositories. During the
meeting, many key objectives for a digital toolkit were agreed
to, namely, that a workbench should create efficiences in
archival work, reduce barriers to repository participation in
consortial or union databases, lower needs and cost for
technological training across a repository's archival staff, and
promote data content and structure standarization. The meeting
discussion revealed several high level design considerations
necessary for realizing the objectives. A toolkit would be
strongly related to the life cyle of archival materials. It would
capture and manage information beyond the description of a
collection. It would need to be flexible and capable of being
used equally well in different workflows. It would have to be
modular, with a clean separation between input, storage, and
output components. Finally, a digital toolkit would require a
well thought out service plan that would make facilitate
implementation of the toolkit and its modification to meet
changes in technology and archival work.</p>

<p>As libraries begin to deal with digital content from sources
outside of library collections, agreements will be needed to
establish and document the associated intellectual property
rights. The sources and kinds of agreements may vary tremendously
-- donations of content that can be digitized, repositories of
institutional intellectual content in digital format, hosting
services for a coalition of partners, borrowing content to make
digital copies, and the like. Just as libraries banded together
to understand terms and build model licenses for licensing
content from commercial suppliers, libraries should cooperate in
drafting model licenses that support the rights for libraries to
create or host digital content. This Birds of a Feather session
will share some examples of agreements and explore what DLF
libraries are and can be doing in this area.</p>

An open systems framework</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Daniel P. Johnson</b>, Digital Library Technical Analyst,
Indiana University Digital Library Program</p>

<p>Open systems could be considered the nirvana of technological
interoperablity. This type of framework allows for cross-platform
semantic homogeny, fostering interface development and storage
that is functional across the system. Technology exists today
that will allow for a digital library infrastructure that is
truly open in this sense. The entire collection can be stored in
object-oriented database systems which will permit the
development of interfaces written in numerous languages to access
the data. The need for file translators and conversion is no
longer necessary once such a setting is achieved. Additionally,
behaviours can be added to the objects allowing for further
operability. Once such a system is in place, specific to the
collection, new and improved methods of combining the data and
displaying it might be realised. Current techonologies which
promote openness as well as future trends will be discussed.</p>

<p>The UCSD Libraries, the Geological Data Center at Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, and the San Diego Supercomputer
Center are collaborating on an NSF-funded NSDL project to
'bridge-the-gap' between collections of oceanographic data
collected by ship-based expeditions and physical archives of
older, pre-digital, expeditions held within library archives in a
manner consistent with modern and emerging library standards and
practices. Our project aims to create a site that can deliver
research data to the scientist while at the same time
communicating the excitement of oceanographic discovery to the
non-scientific public. Data sources range from bathymetry and
geochemical data collected on scientific expeditions to diaries
of expedition participants and photographs of scientific
instruments. With tools developed by the San Diego Supercomputer
Center, we are using a geospatial approach to unite these diverse
data streams and the disparate vocabularies and metadata used by
the participants. Our project is forcing us to confront a wide
range of interoperability issues, ranging from the technical to
the cultural. This paper will present our approach and expose the
decisions we have made in attempting to build a highly
interoperable and scalable method of publishing scientific data
and supporting archival materials.</p>

<h4><a id="jewell" name="jewell">Toward</a> Standards for
E-Resource Management Metadata</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Tim Jewell</b>, University of Washington</p>

<p>During the last year or two, developers of local systems for
managing electronic resources have shared information about their
functions and data elements with one another and other interested
parties. An interest in developing standards for such work has
grown out of these discussions, which led to the organization of
a NISO/DLF sponsored half-day workshop on this topic planned for
May 10th as an adjunct to the DLF Spring Forum (see <a
href="http://www.niso.org/news/events_workshops/NISO-DLF-wkshp.html ">
http://www.niso.org/news/events_workshops/NISO-DLF-wkshp.html</a>).
This presentation will summarize the workshop presentations and
discussions for those unable to attend, and provide an
opportunity for further discussion of "next steps."</p>

<p>The Libraries of the University of Michigan, the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Emory University have received
support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to implement a suite
of OAI-based metadata harvesting services, search services, and
tools designed to facilitate discovery and retrieval of scholarly
information. Two distinct metadata search services are being
developed utilizing shared infrastructure components and software
tools that will be made available under an Open Source Initiative
license.</p>

<p>The University of Michigan search service, called OAIster (<a
href=" http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/">http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/</a>),
is under development by the Digital Library Production Service
(<a
href=" http://www.umdl.umich.edu/">http://www.umdl.umich.edu/</a>).
It is intended to be global in scope, providing cross-repository
searching of metadata describing publicly available digital
objects. The Michigan service is relatively "lightweight" (e.g.,
without duplication or thesauri) and is being designed to answer
the pressing need for opening the "hidden web" information
resources of the scholarly community.</p>

<p>The University of Illinois has developed a vertical,
domain-specific portal designed to search metadata describing
manuscript archives and digital cultural heritage information
resources (<a
href=" http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/">http://oai.grainger.uiuc.edu/</a>).
Metadata describing non-digital resources and resources of
restricted availability is included along with metadata
describing publicly available digital objects.</p>

<p>At Emory University, two grant projects - AmericaSouth.org (<a
href=" http://www.AmericaSouth.org/">http://www.AmericaSouth.org/</a>)
and MetaArchive.org (<a
href=" http://www.MetaArchive.org/">http://www.MetaArchive.org/</a>)
- have been collaboratively conjoined and are being carried
forward in cooperation with partner institu</p>
