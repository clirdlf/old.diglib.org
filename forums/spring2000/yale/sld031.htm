During the spring 2000 semester, the assessment team will engage project faculty and graduate students in a discussion of their baseline expectations: How do they presently think the new technologies could advance their goals as students and teachers?  Simultaneously, the assessment team will plan its own assessment strategy.  This will include devising questionnaires for participating faculty and students, defining the variables that will be studied in this arena, and settling upon a methodology for the assessment program proper.  ...  Periodic forums as well as focus group meetings will enable project participants (librarians and other project staff, faculty, students) to learn from one another's experience, to update, test, validate and revise our expectations.
