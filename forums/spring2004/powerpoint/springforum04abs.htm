<span lang="EN" style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>The university
libraries of Cornell, G&ouml;ttingen, and Michigan have made
available a significant body of mathematical monographs with
access provided through a distributed full text search protocol.
The virtual collection, comprising more than 2,000 volumes of
significant historical mathematical material (nearly 600,000
pages), resides at the three separate institutions and is
provided through interfaces to the three entirely different
software systems. Two distinct public interfaces to the
collection are currently available, both based on the common
protocol but reflecting different development efforts at Michigan
and Cornell and different perspectives on how to best mediate
searches.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style='mso-ansi-language:EN'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span> The protocol for this
distributed search was developed by the three participating
institutions over the last three years, with generous support
provided by the National Science Foundation. Working from the
roots of the DIENST and the then-emergent OAI protocols, the
project team focused on creating a new protocol--dubbed CGM, for
"Cornell, G&ouml;ttingen, Michigan"--that was consistent with
OAI, borrowed from DIENST, and added mechanisms for full text
searching.</span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span> David Ruddy will give a
technical overview of the CGM protocol and how it has been
implemented in this project, describing in particular how the
protocol conveys information about document structure. He will
focus attention primarily on the Search verb and several of its
challenges: improving search precision through structured
queries; identifying common search regions across documents with
incongruent structures; and handling large results sets with
scaffolding techniques.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>John P. Wilkin will
suggest that the CGM experience demonstrates that
interoperability is not a technical problem, but rather a social
one. The CGM protocol demonstrates a solid beginning for full
text interoperability; nevertheless, he argues, the problem of
content silos has more to do with "dysfunction" among developing
digital libraries. Ultimately, what we should hope to accomplish
is large, shared repositories. At this point, "interoperability"
will cease to be the excuse for not sharing, but will instead be
the glue that binds together large multi-institutional
efforts.</span></p>

the metadata to be used in such a system, given the diversity of

grown materials for academic use, but without a systematic effort
to catalog them. Thus these materials are not easily found for
reuse by faculty and students.<span

University of Virginia Library started working to create an

eventually the term "digital library" would refer to a federated
effort on the part of somewhere between 10 and 1000 research
libraries, working with a variety of other information providers,
to provide a seamless integrated network of information for K-12
and college classrooms, scholarly research and for life-long

broad collection of digital resources in all content types and
all media.</span></p>

for overlapping sub-graphs of content to represent any number of
contexts for a given resource and could be seamlessly distributed

style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>This presentation will describe
three studies conducted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries
to acquire permission to provide open Internet access to
copyrighted books. The first study, a random sample feasibility
study in 2000-2001, secured an overall success rate of 22%,
though the success rate varied significantly by publisher type.
The second study, in 2003, sought to acquire permission to
digitize and provide open access to a collection of fine and rare
books and accompanying archival documents. Different strategies
for negotiating with publishers in this study yielded an overall
success rate of 44% with a transaction cost of $78 per title. It
also showed that authors and estates are as likely to grant
permission as university presses. The current and largest study
is an attempt to acquire copyright permission to provide open
access to 500,000 copyrighted books. Strategies being tested in
this study are designed to increase the success rate and decrease
the transaction cost per title. Using items in selected
collections as an approval plan for publishers, educating these
publishers about user behaviors and preferences, offering them
incentives to participate in the project, and doing prompt
personal follow-up to the initial request letter have already
yielded permission to digitize thousands of out-of-print,
in-copyright books -- at a cost of $1.50 per title. In addition
to the copyrighted books made available on the web, this study
will produce best practices for acquiring copyright permission, a
database of publisher contact information, and ultimately an
outcomes assessment of participating publisher attitudes towards
open access.</span></p>

E-Book Project is a cooperative publishing venture among the
American Council of Learned Societies, eight scholarly societies,

previously published books ("backlist") selected by historians
from participating learned societies, as well as 15 new titles
("frontlist") developed with participating presses. Each year,
250 backlist titles will be added to the collection. Over the
next few years, a total of 85 new frontlist titles will be
published, ranging from "print-first" to completely new,
"born-digital" titles. The technology back-end for the project is

an online object (beyond basic location URL). To ensure that
scholars can effectively use and create digital material, it is
critical for our new cyberinfrastructure to coordinate use of

<p style='margin-left:54.0pt'><span lang="EN"
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Virtual Remote Control (VRC) is
Cornell's risk management approach for Web resources.
<i>Virtual</i> because the approach uses web tools to develop
baseline data models representing essential features of selected
sites that enable ongoing monitoring. <i>Remote</i> because the
approach is intended for use by cultural heritage institutions
interested in the longevity of web resources residing on remote
servers, i.e., not owned or managed by the institution itself.
<i>Control</i> because at the most proactive end of the approach
a monitoring organization may act to protect another
organization's resources by agreement or implicit consent through
notification and/or action. The VRC approach includes but does
not presume the capture of Web sites -- a monitoring organization
may not have the means, authority or desire to capture all or
some iterations of a Web site. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation
allows monitoring organizations to intelligently manage Web
resources over time. In conducting our research, we have learned
a lot about good Web site management and about promulgating good
practice to encourage Web longevity. We will present a review of
the model and our findings.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Issues of digital
video collection building are only slowly entering the digital
library discourse: text and images have held sway for more than a
decade. The reasons are easy to understand: digital video is
tremendously demanding of system and staff resources; there are
no clear technical or metadata standards; technological
developments are driven by forces outside the world of academia.
The primary reason, though, is simply this: libraries generally
do not assign the same importance to their motion media
collections as they do to their text.</span></p>

production-level creation and delivery are a real possibility for
academic libraries, and we are now looking at our video
collections with new eyes. At the University of Virginia, our
forays into this realm are being driven by the demands of our

challenges has been to develop a set of consistently
"user-friendly" search and retrieval functions appropriate for a
wide audience. The NYPL Research Libraries' traditional user-base
has included curators, academic librarians, professors, authors
and other researchers, but it is anticipated that NYPL Digital
Gallery's future audience will likely include a majority of other
users (K-12 students, post-secondary students, hobbyists, the
intellectually curious, the causal browser referred from an

User Study (VIUS) and LionShare projects and UC's Image
Demonstrator Project the presenters will draw upon surveys, focus
groups, and related data, as well as experience in service
prototyping to explore image services from the user perspective.
Through the continuum of users' efforts to create, discover, use
and reuse images for research and instruction, the presenters
will discuss what has been learned about user needs and
institutional capabilities to meet them, what is puzzling, and
what areas still need investigation. Penn State's VIUS
documented the importance of content and one-stop-shopping to
potential system users. The UC's work pinpoints critical areas
(metadata, software, workflow, and others) in the complex process
of coordinating multiple collections. The research of both
institutions underscores the importance of personal collections
(44% of pictures users maintain one.) UC is working with LUNA's
Insight to test a personal collection manager that is fully
coordinated with institutional collections. Penn State's
LionShare project proposes a peer-to-peer model that would
enhance access to personal collections and facilitate interaction
with institutional collections.</span></p>

discuss some of the conceptual problems that arise when we try to
make the XSLT scripts more usable by documenting the meaning
behind the transforms. Our demo associates three pieces of
information: the crosswalk, the source metadata standard, and the
target metadata standard, each of which may have a

crosswalks are not meant to be reusable. A more hopeful view is
that crosswalks are persistent and represent an attempt to
identify interoperable elements among metadata standards that
have been developed in different communities of practice. A

Illinois holds an internationally renowned collection of emblem
books that is among the most highly utilized primary source
materials of its type worldwide. Nationally and internationally
known emblem scholars regularly consult our collections and the
collections have been the topic of numerous publications about
the emblems themselves and their bibliographic environments.
Emblem books can possibly be looked upon as the multi-medial
publications of the 17th and 18th centuries. They are books that
link together three constitutive elements-a motto, a woodcut or
engraving and an explanatory poem. An emblem is more than the sum
of its parts, because the interplay between text and image
produces a great meaning than any of the individual components
can provide.</span></p>

up a new portal for the world-wide emblem scholarly community,
using the Internet Scout Portal Toolkit, developed at the

the digitized emblem books from the University of Illinois which
have been cataloged using a metadata schema developed
specifically for emblem books and which we map to the Dublin Core

Archive: Research, Tradition, and History (HEARTH) project at
Cornell University's Albert R. Mann Library, a core electronic
collection of monographs and serials in home economics and
related disciplines published between 1850 and 1950, is a prime
example of a successful, collaborative digital library project.
The HEARTH project has multiple components: metadata, content, a
system and user interface for storing and accessing the metadata
and content, and a front end on the World Wide Web to provide
some context to the overall project. Rather than concentrating
the work on all these components in one particular library unit,
the work was dispersed throughout all sections of the
library.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span> The workflow for
this project fell across various units within the library,
including the information technology section, collection
development and preservation, technical services and public
services. Staff in the information technology section created the
systems that were used to create structural metadata and tie it
together with the other metadata components. Metadata was created
by three different project groups: structural metadata by
preservation staff, descriptive metadata by technical services
staff, and administrative metadata by the scanning vendor. Staff
in the public services section created the web-based front end
used to access the content in HEARTH. We will discuss the
workflow and connections between the departments that were
associated with this project. We will show how the cooperation
between these groups resulted in a successful digital library
system.</span></p>

presents findings from a major research project conducted to
measure the usability of on-line archival finding aids. The study
measured responses for users interacting with eight finding aids,
including interfaces at DLF members Illinois, Yale, Princeton,
and U-C Berkeley/CDL. The study provides specific insights
regarding how users navigate archival descriptive information and
how archivists and digital librarians might design interfaces
which facilitate effective search strategies. Both the
methodology employed and the conclusions will likely be of broad
interest to conference attendees. The study juxtaposed different
interfaces in a ASP-driven search portal. (See <a
href="http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/survey/usab-test/">http://web.library.uiuc.edu/ahx/survey/usab-test/</a>
for a non-functional version.) In addition, all users took a
survey and thirty-five of the 89 participants were observed by
the project director or his assistant. Both statistical and
qualitative findings are provided and correlated to demographic
data such as archival/library experience and self-reported
computer expertise.</span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span> The study found that system
(i.e. computer) expertise was a more salient predictor of quick
finding aid usage than was domain (i.e. archival) expertise.
Experienced archival users and novices utilize very different
methods of searching for archival information. Nevertheless,
certain finding aid features (including alphabetical lists,
page-top tables of contents, Google-like search algorithms, and
single-page search options) enabled both sets of users to use
some interfaces much more efficiently than alternate designs. The
study provides baseline data and conclusions which will assist in
reengineering access to archival finding aids and by implication
digital libraries.</span></p>

<span lang="EN" style='mso-ansi-language:EN'>Current Portal
solutions (incl. the Digital Library North Rhine-Westphalia,

technology and concepts are often based in the first hand on
searching metadata (bibliographic descriptions, keywords,

Bielefeld UL has taken a pragmatic approach that builds on
existing state-of-the-art search and content matching technology
and develops on top of it where necessary. The main focus is not
on generic research but on improvements or adoptions by
development of add-ons. Instead of developing a new system or
spending resources on rebuilding a powerful search architecture,
efforts and resources should better be focusing on improving
user-interfaces, adding intelligent browsing and navigation
features to search boxes or developing and introducing more
generic connectors to integrate the "deep" web
