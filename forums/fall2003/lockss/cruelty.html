<!--cruelty Cruelty I need to draw the line for you and me: a poem is not Democracy. You are my hands, you serve and wait. You're something I manipulate. Let me be clear on this. I paint a tree and, on the ground, a white and perfect egg that's fallen (now you cry). I paint a snake (and here you cringe). But now that I am painting you, you flinch because you know this room. Your father (whom you never knew) is here as well, despite his gravestone and the years. You try to kiss his hand, but I erase your lips, his eyes- I leave the rest. Get mad. Get in your car and leave. All poems, at heart, are tyranny. You are my hands.  You are my hands.  You are my hands.  You are my hands.  You are my hands.  You are my hands.  You are my hands.
