  groups, one in October and one a month later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

  “mock session” with our project team and worked out some of the kinks of
  observing, recording and collating user behavior.</font><br>

  group round was conducted using the “paper prototyping model,” where users
  were asked to study and “interact” with paper models as though they were
  using a live system.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We used screen
  shots printed on regular sized paper and on poster sized paper, employing a
  plotter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We asked users a series of
  questions and recorded observations as they took actions and moved through
  different screens.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point, our
  prototype still resembled the out-of-the-box ENCompass interface fairly
  closely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We conducted sessions with
  about twenty faculty and students separately.</font><br>
