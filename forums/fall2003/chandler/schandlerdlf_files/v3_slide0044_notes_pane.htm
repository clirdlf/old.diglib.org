  at how many users were accessing the system overall.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be more accurate, this line graph shows
  how many sessions were logged during the 10-week period, by week.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A session is started when a user clicks on
  a link pointing to one of the files associated with the new system and begins
  performing what are called “search actions,” i.e., moving to another screen,
  performing a search, or browsing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Unfortunately, for purposes of the ENCompass log data, we found that
  sessions ended not only by exiting the system and/or closing the browser but
  also by clicking on the browser back button.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>This meant that if users hit the browser back button rather than
  navigational buttons provided in the interface itself, a new session ID would
  be logged automatically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This problem
  needs to be addressed in future in order to ensure a more accurate count of
  session IDs.</font><br>
