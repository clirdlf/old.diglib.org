  version of one of two new functioning screens we had users test in our
  November round.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Notice that we went
  with the tab approach but used simple, understandable terms, as Jakob Nielsen
  recommends and as is the current trend with many library research portals
  .<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From our Library Gateway home page
  navigation bar, we planned to include each of these tabs as a separate entry
  point into the system:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Find:<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Articles, Databases, and, (later),
  e-Journals.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The screen you
  are looking at, Find Databases, allows for resource discovery, what ENCompass
  2.0 was calling “Discover a Resource” in that screen I showed you a few
  moments ago.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You will notice that we
  chose to keep searching and browsing on one screen but separated them and did
  away with the expandable table/checkbox look and feel.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If users wanted to browse through
  categories, they could click on a hypertext link and launch a new page,
  rather than expanding within the same page.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>This approach had been taken with the existing e-Reference collection
  and had worked well, so after experimenting with alternatives, we decided to
  go with the familiar.</font><br>

  </span>Admittedly, this note added “clutter” but became a priority later as
  reference librarians submitted their feedback.</font><br>
