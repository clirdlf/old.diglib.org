  Find it at Cornell?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are very
  interested in how many users are clicking on the Find it at Cornell link from
  a find articles object record, and further, how many are then clicking on the
  full text when that option is available for a given article.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since reference linking is a service that
  users highly value and expect more and more, we anticipated that full text
  access would be high.</font><br>

  Cornell screen and clicking on the full text link for an article.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The red represents how many times users
  clicked on Find it at Cornell, and the blue represents how many times they
  went to the full text.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Given the
  assumption that users want to go to the full text and would click on a link
  if it were present, the numbers you see here surprised us.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=1>I added the
  chart on the right for a point of comparison – take a look at the top line,
  which represents the number of times Find Articles was accessed, week by
  week.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, if we look at week
  2 for this chart and compare it to week 2 of the chart on the left, we can
  surmise that out of about 5,000 sessions where users searched Find Articles,
  the Find it at Cornell screen was accessed about 1,200 times.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From there, users clicked on roughly 250
  full text articles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, it appears
  users are connecting to full text via Find Articles and Find it at
  Cornell<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a surprisingly small
  percentage of the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point,
  we have only about 35 remote repository connections in Find Articles, whereas
  Find Databases connects to over 1,000 resources.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Although it is true that not all of the 35
  remote repository connections in Find Articles link to full text articles, it
  is also true that reference linking should allow for a much higher rate of
  full text access.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Currently, the
  number of electronic journals in our “knowledge base” in LinkFinder Plus
  covers about 90% of our total Cornell subscriptions.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=1>Are users
  selecting and searching more non-full-text rather than resources through Find
  Articles?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they are searching full
  text resources, are they having difficulty recognizing how to connect to the
  full text?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Currently, we have the full
  text link showing up at the bottom of the Find it at Cornell page, below our
  Catalog search options, as is the default display setting in LinkFinder
  Plus.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are in the process of moving
  the link up above the catalog search options so it will be interesting to see
  if that display order increases the number of connections to full text.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Beyond that, we need to do some user
  observation to determine how users are navigating Find it At Cornell and
  whether or not they are missing the links.</font><br>
