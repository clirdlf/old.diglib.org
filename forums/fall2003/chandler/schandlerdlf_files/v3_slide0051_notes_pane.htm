  more compatible with the Apache web log data.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Additionally, if the issue with the browser back button leading to
  false session IDs were corrected, we could perform more meaningful and
  accurate analysis on some of the data in the ENCompass logs.<span

  formulating a methodology and have plans to better document the work we have
  done thus far.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We want to turn this
