  working with release 2.0 “out-of-the-box” we recognized that we would require
  significant customization of the interface in order to meet the needs<b> </b>of
  our user base.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The product allowed for
  extensive customization through XSLT, which required a serious time
  commitment on the part of our team members with that expertise.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a development partner, we were also able
  to turn to Endeavor for consultation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>We knew that starting down the road of customization would mean more
  complex maintenance and integration of upgrade enhancements in future, but we
  anticipated that the result would be a greatly improved product for our
  users.</font><br>

  </span>By fall of 2002, we had incorporated most of the new features and had
  a prototype that was functional enough to warrant user testing.<span

  design process and had plenty of useful input from members of our
  cross-functional project team, we knew that hearing from our users directly
  at this early stage was vital.</font><br>
