  how users are connecting to databases now that we have two points of access –
  Find Articles and Find Databases….Here is a look at the month of
  October.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Connections through Find
  Articles are in the bars to the left, in light blue, and connections to Find
  Databases are in the bars to the right, in purple.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>At first glance,
  it looks like many more users are searching databases through Find
  Articles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, there is a big
  caveat here:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>whenever a user clicks on
  a database from Find Databases and then connects, we have no record of how
  many times he or she then runs searches in that database.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is information that only the vendor
  has at the present time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In contrast,
  since we have access to the data for how many times a user connects to a
  remote repository in Find Articles, via our ENCompass tables, we can
  determine how many actual searches were run per database.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a result, the number of searches by
  database in Find Databases should be much higher than what you see here – we
  are only able to represent the first search each user runs.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Therefore, what
  you are looking at is not an accurate comparison.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, after a user connects to Find
  Databases, we do not know how many searches were run.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In order to run a true comparison, we would
  need to obtain vendor information on individual number of searches for
  Cornell users, by database.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>Because the Find
  Databases numbers you see are artificially low, we know that users are
  accessing certain databases (ProQuest and BIOSIS, for example) through the
  native interface more often than through the Find Articles page.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(If we were looking at a one-to-one search
  comparison, the purple bars would be much higher.)<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In contrast, take a look at ArticleFirst
  and Zoological Abstracts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A relatively
  small number of users searched those through the native interface, while a
  significant number of those users searched them through Find Articles.</font><br>
