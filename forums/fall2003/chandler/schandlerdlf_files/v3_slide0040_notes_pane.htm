  analysis allowed us to observe user behavior without being intrusive and
  possibly influencing user results.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>Since this initial analysis was done during the summer, you should
  know that we had not made a full cutover to the new system yet.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is, we had the old e-Reference system
  working in parallel with the new Find Databases/Find Articles system from May
  19<sup>th</sup> until mid August, when we eliminated the old system
  completely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This meant that our
  analysis of the new system logs would not give us a true picture of how the
  system would perform at full capacity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>However, it gave us an opportunity to set up the initial analysis on a
  smaller, more manageable data set.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
  had plans for rerunning the analysis once the new system completely replaced
  e-Reference.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Our data set for
  the summer analysis came from the Oracle tables in ENCompass and the Apache
  web logs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We hired a Communications
  Department graduate student to run Microsoft Access queries on data from both
  sources, thanks to a Perl script a project team member wrote, which parsed
  relevant data from the voluminous Apache logs. Even with this script, we
  quickly found that merging the two data sets was problematic.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, the date and timestamps for
  each session did not line up in exactly the same way, and whereas Apache
  contained much more raw data, it actually did not contain the kind of
  detailed information within each session that the Oracle tables in ENCompass
  offered.</font><br>
