  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><b>Here</b> is
  what our main screen looked like for the October 2002 user testing
  sessions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It still replicated the
  “Browse/Search Resource” screen of the ENCompass 2.0 interface quite closely,
  though we did choose to remove the direct searching connections and integrate
  article level searching into the interface later.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the page you see, users could only
  search and browse metadata about resources, as was the case with the
  e-Reference interface.</font><br>

  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2>The 2.0 design
  included a shaded table format with expandable/collapsible categories and
  checkboxes and presumed that the user knew to type a query term in the search
  box and then select one or more categories and/or specific resources below it
  to run a search.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><b>We</b> found that
  users were confused by this design, for several reasons.</font><br>
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><b>Browsing</b>
  and searching capabilities were presented in a way that was not
  intuitive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It took users some time to
  figure out how to navigate the series of checkboxes beneath the search
  box.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was compounded by the
  expanding/collapsing checkbox categories design; expanding a category meant
  reloading the screen with more subcategories showing and more shaded rows in
  the table to scroll through.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Users
  were disoriented as they clicked deeper and deeper into the same screen.</font><br>
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><b>Further</b>,
  some users did not understand that they could select and search for more than
  one resource at a time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While
  cross-collection searching was a familiar concept to our users in other
  contexts, it was new to the e-Reference collection and required clearer
  presentation.</font><br>
  </td>

 <tr>
  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><b>As</b> had
  been the case in the past, users still attempted to perform article level
  searching, despite the explanatory text at the top of the page.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The e-Reference interface had included
  similar text, but clearly, many users were not reading it.</font><br>
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face="Times New Roman" size=2><b>Finally</b>,
  the name “e-Reference” appeared to hold less meaning than we anticipated for
  most of our users.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this early
  prototype, you can see that we retained the “e-Reference collection” name at
  the top.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We wanted to preserve the
  identity of this heavily used system and had assumed that keeping the same
  name was important to our users.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While
  it is certainly true that experienced users identified with the name and that
  many librarians favored keeping it, our sample indicated that the name was
  not particularly meaningful to new users.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
  </span>And, as we looked at adding the article level searching functionality,
  the name became problematic.</font><br>
