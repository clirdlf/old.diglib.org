<h3><a id="gis" name="gis">On digital maps and GIS</a></h3>

<div style="margin-left: 4em"><b>David Rumsey</b>, Cartography
Associates, David Rumsey Historical Map Collection, <a
href="www.davidrumsey.com">www.davidrumsey.com</a> 

<p>What happens when the "display" software we use to show
digital collections online becomes so powerful that it begins to
transform the online collection itself? Using Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) software in this manner offers an
interesting example of how digital collections representing
cultural objects can be radically reformatted and opened up by
software. This talk will explore the use of GIS in enabling
analysis and interpretation of digital historical maps both in
their object form and as digital collections. GIS offers an
example of the use of software to not only search and index
digital collections, but also to reformat (through
Georeferencing) digital historical maps to enable measurement,
comparison, and analysis that was not possible with the original
digital object. In addition, GIS gives us interesting methods of
search visualization comparable to hyperbolic trees and other
spatial schemes used to represent collection contents.
Increasingly, the line between "born digital" GIS content
(databases, vector maps) and scanned digital historical maps is
being blurred, as all this information is combined and mixed
through 3D, transparency, and data queries. This raises
interesting questions about the integrity of the original digital
image scan and its relationship to its many new manifestations in
the GIS. The potential for rich combinations of this data will be
enhanced by the growth of several online GIS repositories,
already in formation. Practical implementation of these concepts
will be shown through the speaker's experience in building an
online collection of historical maps, <a
href="www.davidrumsey.com">www.davidrumsey.com</a>, and moving it
into the GIS sphere.</p>

<p>Recruitment, training, and retention of good staff are real
and serious impediments to the digital library's development. The
problems are only partly financial. Career paths that intersect
with digital library programs are not at all well established;
nor are the professional development and reward structures.
Schools of library and information science may contribute
substantially to solutions but may themselves be constrained, for
example, by their curricula, the abilities of their incoming
students, even by their academic staff. From their very different
perspectives, the three speakers in this session will initiate
discussion by attempting to:</p>

<ul>
<li>define the dimensions of the digital library's staffing
problem;</li>

<li>define the digital library's staffing requirements;</li>

<li>explore different strategies for meeting those requirements
including strategies that involve close collaboration with
relevant academic schools and departments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Forum participants who attend the session will be encouraged
to contribute their own thinking and experience and also to help
think about whether, how, and to what extent the area may be an
appropriate one in which to move with a DLF initiative.</p>

<p><b>Ed Pentz</b>, CrossRef</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crossref.org">CrossRef</a> is a non-profit
organization setup up by scholarly publishers in January 2000.
Based on collaboration and standards, the CrossRef system enables
the automated large-scale assignment of DOIs to scholarly journal
articles, conference proceedings and books and the efficient
creation of reference links using DOIs. Widespread reference
linking is now taking place between CrossRef members and
affiliates. With the CrossRef/DOI infrastructure in place, more
sophisticated linking models are being developed.</p>

<h4><a id="openurl" name="openurl">OpenURL. A standard for
extended linking</a></h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Eric Van de Velde</b>, California Institute of
Technology</p>

<p>A URL takes requesters from a citation to a destination...
provided, of course, the URL is still valid. The OpenURL
standard, which we are developing under the auspices of NISO,
allows the development of high-quality links that feature
additional properties, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style: none">Persistence: Increase the probable
lifetime of citations.</li>

<li>Multiplicity: Produce a menu of services for each
citation.</li>

<li>Context-Sensitivity: Resolve a citation in a manner
appropriate to the requester's context.</li>

<li>Manageability: Create a log of citations according to
requester specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few commercial services can provide some of this
functionality right now. To encourage the growth of more and
better extended-linking services, NISO has put the
standardization of OpenURL on the fast track. We are developing a
standard that will serve the scholarly-information community
immediately and other communities in the long term. The current
chaotic web is wonderful in its way. However, within this web
infrastructure, we believe there is a need for a high-quality web
of vetted information. To bring this to the scholarly-information
society as soon as possible, we need the OpenURL standard as a
key enabling technology. I will outline the major issues of
OpenURL standardization, and I will show how you can get
involved.</p>

<p>With development support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
Project Euclid has as its goal the advancement of affordable
scholarly communications in mathematics and statistics. A
consortial effort among Cornell University Library, Duke
University Press, and several development partners who publish
math and statistics literature, Euclid will provide independent
publishers with a mechanism for the discovery, display, and
distribution of their electronic content. By doing so, we hope to
challenge emerging patterns of consolidation in the ownership and
dissemination of scholarship, at the same time recognizing and
encouraging the value added by learned societies and other
publishers of scholarly materials. Project Euclid represents an
expanded and more active role for academic libraries in the arena
of scholarly communication. This talk will give an overview of
the project--its goals, scope, challenges, technical design, and

scholarly communication. In just two years developments in
digital technologies and Web publishing, coupled with greater
acceptance of non-traditional publishing forms, have given rise
to ever more sophisticated scholar-led projects and a
corresponding array of unsettled questions concerning copyright,
peer-review, and permanence of the scholarly record. Currently,
eScholarship is exploring production level dissemination and

<p>The University of Michigan Library's Scholarly Publishing
Office (SPO) has tools and methods for the electronic publication
and distribution of scholarly content. The office supports the
traditional constructs of journal and monographic publication in
an online environment, as well as publishing scholarly work
expressly designed for electronic delivery. SPO exists to develop
services that are responsive to the needs of both producers and
users, to foster a better economic model for campus publishing,
to support local control of intellectual assets, and to create
highly functional scholarly resources. SPO is particularly
concerned -as this talk will reflect - with building sustainable
models and methods the can be shared with other institutions and
that bridge the gap between academic self-publishing and large,
aggregated, commercial publishing.</p>

<h4><a id="newexpect" name="newexpect">New expectations and
traditional stewardship in museums and libraries</a></h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Bernard Reilly</b>, Director, Center for Research
Libraries</p>

<p>Changing conditions in the non-profit cultural sector have
created a new baseline of expectations of publicly supported
public institutions. Previously the "contract" between the
community and its libraries and museums outlined the basic
expectations for those institutions. This contract, albeit often
an implied one, derived from statutory obligations of non-profit
organizations, the inherent conditions of public funding, and the
traditions of philanthropy in the U.S. The contract entailed a
stewardship role that involved: long-term preservation and
security of cultural materials; continuous and unrestricted
availability of those materials to a general audience or to the
supporting community; and a general accountability of the
organizations to their supporting community.</p>

<p>This stewardship role may not convey to those libraries' and
museums' activities in the global, digital environment. New
models for service and product delivery, compensation, and
funding are creating different, and far higher, audience
expectations for service and access. Information and content must
be more than just secure and available: it must be delivered to
the desktop and presented together with user tools and ancillary
resources. Users expect to obtain more than catalog records and
other such limited kinds of information from museum and library
web sites. They expect real-time responsiveness and information
on demand. This involves a tacit "upping of the ante" for
libraries and museums, beyond the demands for responsible
stewardship. To fulfill such expectations, works of art and
collections in themselves offer relatively little help. They are
"inert" assets. The content embodied in those collections, i.e.,
the visual and textual data contained in them, and even the
expertise of curatorial and research staff, are the more "liquid"
and hence valuable assets. These can be re-aggregated,
electronically delivered, licensed, and brokered by the
organizations for revenue and other benefits. The high costs of
operating in this environment, moreover, are driving
organizations toward financially self-sustaining activities and
alliances, which in turn reinforce the drift away from
stewardship. My presentation will explore the costs of such
expectations, and examine some of the larger factors that have
driven such changes. I will also suggest terms that might be
useful for a new "contract" between cultural heritage
organizations and the public.</p>

<h4><a id="phonehome" name="phonehome"></a>ET call home. Who's
out there: The issue of audience in the digital age</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Barbara Taranto</b>, Digital Library Program, New York
Public Library</p>

<p>As we move deeper into the 21st century, it would be best to
anticipate the issues of audience and move to understand,
strategize and plan for future use of digital materials. Should
we do it, can we do it and how can it be done?</p>

<p>In the world of books, one does not often hear of a novel that
was horrid, but pages 195 through 200 were brilliant. In the
theater occasionally one may hear that the playwright should
reconsider his or her choice of career, even though the
performance by certain actors was inspired. Not so with film. It
is an oddity of the cinematic arts that on the whole a film may
be maudlin, tedious, obtuse, cloying, overacted, under-acted or
simply bad, and still be memorable, not alone for its
shortcomings, but for a single moment when the presentation
transcends the story and becomes something altogether
different.</p>

<p>So it was when Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore stalwartly
supported their extraterrestrial guest as it sent an electronic
mayday out into the cosmos. For the children in the audience
there was nothing incredible, even if they didn't entirely
believe in little squished chocolate marshmallow man with
superior intelligence; about ET sending out a distress signal and
expecting a response. Those children wholeheartedly believed and
continue to believe in the audience "out there".</p>

<p>As libraries consolidate and continue to increase their
special collections, the issues of short-term and long-term
audience becoming heightened. At one time libraries, both
circulating and not, and especially research libraries were
reasonably certain about the topography of their audiences. In
fact, in many cases it was the proscribed audience and not
collection development, per se, that shaped the identity and role
of the institution. But the practices of public service that are
so familiar within the non-research community are fast becoming
the concerns of the specialized libraries.</p>

<p>As we move deeper into the 21st century, it would be best to
anticipate the issues of audience and move to understand,
strategize and plan for future use of digital materials. Not so
much because the technology is changing rapidly, but because the
audience is evolving more quickly than libraries may be prepared
to accommodate.</p>

<p>Who is the new "us"? And who will that be in five years or ten
years? Do we have an obligation to meet the expectations of the
new audience given that it is changing so rapidly? Can we afford
not to?</p>

grants) to encourage all types of cultural heritage institutions
to work together. Libraries of many types, museums and historical
societies large and small, and archives with various emphases
have all partnered to contribute digital resources through a
coordinated statewide effort. This presentation will cover many
of the cross-organizational issues involved in such
collaboration, including museum and library values and culture,

<p><b>Denise Troll</b>, Associate University Librarian, Carnegie

<p>Denise Troll will present the results of an extensive survey
of methods used by leading digital libraries to measure the use
and usability of online collections and services. The study
offers a qualitative, rather than quantitative, look at
experiences conducting digital library assessments. The results
are not comprehensive or representative of library efforts, but
indicative of trends in library practice. The trends identify
popular research methods and common problems encountered when
using these methods to assess and enhance access to and usability
of online collections and services. The most popular research
methods are survey questionnaires, focus groups, user protocols,
and transaction log analysis. The common problems encountered
include difficulty recruiting representative research subjects;
difficulty selecting and using the appropriate research method;
and difficulty analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and applying
the data gathered to strategic planning and decision-making. The
survey results indicate that the internal organization of
libraries and the skills, preferences, and assumptions of
librarians can be the biggest impediments to conducting
successful assessments and implementing the findings. The
presentation at the DLF Forum will focus on significant, common
issues and concerns encountered when conducting assessments using
popular research methods, and conclude with suggestions for
future research or ways to address these concerns.</p>

<p>Interoperability is much advocated, less often achieved. As

activities which have resulted in one definition of such an
environment (<a
href="http://www.dner.ac.uk/">http://www.dner.ac.uk/dner/</a>).
The potential advantages of such an approach are that it gives a
framework for discussing interoperability, that it provides a
common frame of reference for discussing product and service
offerings, that it allows dependencies and roles to be
identified, that it supports a development agenda. Using this
framework as a basis, the presentation will discuss
interoperability issues, and suggest some likely service

NC State University Libraries have identified the goal of
facilitating user-defined cross collection searching. There are a
number of possible approaches to accomplish this. One solution
that NC State Libraries is investigating centers on the use of
MetaStar. MetaStar is a metadata harvesting, management,
indexing, and searching tool. Through a modular architecture that
uses XML as a connection tool, MetaStar provides the ability to
harvest and index metadata from webpages, manage new and existing
collections of metadata, and search multiple local and remote
collections concurrently. Still in the early research and
prototyping stages, we have been designing collections of
intranet metadata, spatial and numeric data search tools, and
subject specific gateway search interfaces.</p>

cross-collection searching</a></h4>

<p><b>Marty Kurth</b>, Head of Cataloguing, Cornell
University</p>

<p>A team at Cornell University Library is engaged in an effort
to provide access to multiple digital collections as well as its
entire online catalog through a single searching-and-browsing
interface. By using the ENCompass digital library management
system, the team is organizing a domain of digital objects that
range in size from the full-text of a single pamphlet page to a
database of over 100,000 electronic books in order to map those
objects into the management system's three-level record structure
of collections, containers, and objects. Striving to provide
users with intelligible result sets has presented many challenges
in three notable areas. First, representing a digital object's
relative size within the system as a whole can be done via a
collection-specific object record when the objects in a
collection are of similar granularity, but objects in variably
granular collections resist this approach. Second, presenting
navigational paths to users to minimize disorientation by such
means as clearly identifying the collections searched and
foregrounding the hierarchical nature of the system's record
structure inevitably runs into inflexibilities in system
architecture. Finally, refining the interface vocabulary to
describe systematically the record structure and the
relationships between the records in the structure confronts the
lack of commonly accepted user terms for digital objects and the
relationships among them. The presentation will describe the
team's efforts to address these challenges thus far. The Cornell
University Library ENCompass Team includes Karen Calhoun (Team
Leader), Meryl Brodsky, George Kozak, Marty Kurth, Fred Muratori,

<p>The Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository
(CUGIR) is a clearinghouse that provides unrestricted access to
geospatial data and metadata, with special emphasis on those
natural features relevant to agriculture, ecology, natural
resources and human-environment interactions in New York State.
CUGIR, like all nodes within the National Spatial Data
Infrastructure (NSDI), is available for searching by way of the
Z39.50 information retrieval protocol. Implementation complexity,
retrieval accuracy, scalability, and performance issues make the
Z39.50 architecture problematic within this context. Our
presentation will describe a system at the Cornell University
Library that bridges the gap between today's NSDI, traditional
MARC-based library catalogs and utilities, and the Open Archives
Initiative (OAI). The glue binding these different digital
objects together is our implementation of Michael Nelson's
pioneering work with "buckets." This session will provide an
overview of the steps, challenges, and problems involved with
mapping and managing complex metadata surrogates across standards
and systems. Finally, we will speculate on how the OAI harvesting
protocol may be seen as an alternative to the current Z39.50 NSDI
system.</p>

<b>Rick Beaubien</b>, University of California at Berkeley</p>

<p><a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a> is a
generalized metadata framework, developed to encode the
structural metadata for objects within a digital library and
related descriptive and administrative metadata. METS provides
for the responsible management and transfer of digital library
objects by bundling and storing appropriate metadata along with
the digital objects. METS is expressed using XML, which means
that METS data is stored according to platform and software
independent encoding standards, such as UTF-8 (Unicode),
ISO-8859-1, etc.</p>

<p>One important application of METS may be as an implementation
of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model
and as such can function as a Submission Information Package
(SIP) for use as a transfer syntax; a Dissemination Information
Package (DIP) for display or other applications; and an Archival
Information Package (AIP) for storing and managing information
internally</p>

<p>This panel will give the background and overview of the
schema, clarifying the distinction between a metadata framework
(such as METS) metadata wrapper schemes (such as RDF). Panelist
from UC Berkeley, The Library of Congress, and Harvard will
review their current and planned usage of METS, and will give
examples of tools in development for producing and using METS
objects. There will be plenty of time for questions and
discussion.</p>

<h3><a id="bench" name="bench"></a>Benchmarking preservation
digital masters and image quality methods</h3>

The DLF has been examining the tools needed for common use in
representing information digitally, including benchmarks for
quality control and uniform interaction. This session will
examine two such efforts. Robin L. Dale, RLG Member Programs
&amp; Initiatives, will chair this session and comment on these
two efforts in the context of others initiatives both nationally
and internationally.

<h4><a id="kenney" name="kenney"></a>Benchmarking digital
reproductions of printed books and serials</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Anne Kenney</b>, Director of Programs, Council for Library
and Information Resources</p>

<p>Libraries and others are digitizing increasing quantities of
printed material for online access without agreement on any
desirable level of imaging quality. The DLF is working to
identify, and build support for, specifications acceptable as the
minimum necessary for digitally reproducing printed books and
serial publications with fidelity. Adoption of such benchmarks
would help users and libraries both. Users could have more
confidence in the fidelity of digital reproductions available to
them. And libraries could produce and maintain reproductions with
confidence that expensive re-digitization would not become
necessary. Digital reproductions meeting at least the benchmarks'
minimum specifications would remain viable even as reproduction
techniques improved.</p>

<p>Also, because such texts would have well-known, consistent
properties, they could support a wide variety of uses (including
uses not possible with printed texts). Additionally, agreement on
minimum benchmarks for digital reproductions of printed
publications is an essential first step for libraries that wish
to investigate whether they could manage and preserve print
materials more effectively if they relied more heavily on digital
reproductions for access. The draft benchmark is currently being
reviewed by DLF member libraries who are being asked to endorse
it. The guidelines have been shared broadly with the DLF
membership, and comments are due back soon. Anne R. Kenney, will
describe the work to date, its status, and next steps. (For

<h4><a id="chapman" name="chapman"></a> Assessing the quality of
digital images and imaging systems</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Steve Chapman</b>, Preservation Librarian for Digital
Initiatives, Weissman Preservation Center, Harvard University</p>

<p>This paper will report on the outcomes of a DLF-sponsored
meeting of 20 expert imaging practitioners to address the
question, "How can we assess the quality of digital images
without ambiguity?" Given that libraries and museums have been
and will likely continue to use different specifications for
image scanning, it is important to consider whether these
collections will be interoperable, particularly when federated in
initiatives such as ArtSTOR. The forum gave practitioners the
opportunity to exchange ideas about what is "good" quality in
images and imaging systems, then to prioritize needed tools,
applications, and training to meet institutional and collective
goals to make digital reproductions of consistent quality and
persistent utility.</p>

<h4><a id="indiana" name="indiana">Plans for an OAI metadata
harvesting service</a></h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><b>Timothy W. Cole</b>, University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 

<p>The University of Illinois has been funded by the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation to research and implement resource discovery
services based on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting (PMH). One of seven OAI Metadata Harvesting
projects funded by Mellon, the Illinois Metadata Harvesting
Service will focus on indexing item-level metadata describing
cultural heritage holdings of libraries and museums with a
special emphasis on the harvest of Encoded Archival Description
(EAD) finding aids and metadata describing cultural heritage
content held by CIC libraries and allied archives and museums. A
prototype portal allowing search and retrieval of harvested
metadata will be developed and tested with end users. A primary
objective of the Illinois project is to investigate and document
the potential of OAI-based services to reveal and make more
accessible "hidden" online scholarly information resources in the
cultural heritage domain. We will be investigating a wide-range
of issues including those related to search interface design,
value-added indexing functions, presentation of search results,
transformations between heterogeneous metadata schemas and
subject taxonomies, portal usage patterns, and the influence on
search success of adherence to metadata creation "best
practices." This presentation will describe preliminary system
architecture, current project plans, and work done to date. A
preliminary harvest of more than 150,000 metadata records from a
half dozen OAI Metadata Providers has been completed and will be
discussed. Open Source tools and sample implementations for both
OAI Provider and OAI Harvesting services have been developed and
also will be discussed during this presentation.</p>

<h4><a id="minnesota" name="minnesota">The IMAGES project:
Building a metadata sharing community at the University of
Minnesota</a></h4>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Chuck Thomas</b>, Digital Projects Librarian, University of
Minnesota Libraries</p>

<p>Since project inception in April 2000, the IMAGES (Image
Metadata Aggregation for Enhanced Searching) initiative has been
a major component of the University of Minnesota Libraries
digital library effort. IMAGES is both a delivery platform for
all digital imaging projects within the University Libraries, and
a metadata aggregator for the entire campus. The IMAGES model is
offered as a strategy for establishing libraries as THE place to
find digital content on campuses. The public interface to IMAGES
just went live in July 2001. The presentation on IMAGES will
cover the main concepts behind the project, including a few
unique features not yet found in other sites; lessons and
decisions of the design process; selling the concept to a campus
community; the intended role of IMAGES in a national context;
initial reception by both internal and external audiences; and
future plans for growth.</p>

<p><b>Donald J. Waters</b>, Program Officer, Scholarly
Communications, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</p>

<p>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has supported a wide variety
of digital library projects over the last seven years. The
speaker will highlight some of the lessons learned in these
projects, identify continuing and emerging needs for connecting
scholarly resources to ongoing teaching and research, and explore
with the audience how digital libraries might best be shaped to
meet these needs.</p>
