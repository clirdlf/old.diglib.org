<h2>Digital Technology and Traditional Stewardship in the
Cultural Sector</h2>

<p>Script for a presentation at the Digital Library Forum,
Pittsburgh, PA, November 2001<br />
Bernie Reilly, Center for Research Libraries</p>

<p>Changing conditions in the non-profit cultural sector have
created a new baseline of expectations for publicly supported
cultural institutions. In this world the pressure is high for
libraries and museums to deliver many new things. The Internet,
the realm to which people are turning with increasingly
regularity for information, learning and even cultural
experiences, is a realm of instant gratification and rapid
turnaround. This is a space dominated not by museums and
libraries, but by for-profit entertainment and knowledge
organizations. Those organizations have made streamlined models
for service and product delivery, compensation, and funding the
norm, and this creates different, and far higher, audience
expectations for all who wish to share the digital realm.</p>

<p>As a result, library and museum users expect more than catalog
records and other such limited kinds of information; they expect
full text, images, and multi-media materials. This information,
moreover, must be available on a 24/7 basis, delivered to the
desktop or handheld, and presented together with user tools and
ancillary resources. This sudden change in expectations involves
a tacit "upping of the ante" for libraries and museums. And it is
in addition to, not a replacement of, the customary demands of
responsible stewardship: preservation and public access.
Libraries and museums are absorbing the high costs of digitizing
collections, subscribing to electronic journals, and licensing
databases and interactives, at least for the time being. We have
learned that these new digital resources require their own care
and feeding, and will compete with their artifactual
counterparts, the art works and documents, for preservation funds
as time goes on.</p>

<p>The tendency is to acquiesce to these demands without
identifying sustained sources of funding for those activities.
Most digital activities are project-funded, and licensing
ventures are not even full cost recovery. The high costs of
operating in this environment, combined with the end of the high
yields of the 1990s stock market, combine to force us to make
choices about the things that we will provide to society, about
what we in fact owe to the community. There is no going back, and
we all know that digital technology has made learning more
efficient. That is a good thing. But in this new environment we
need some new coordinates, new terms that can guide us in
fulfilling our societal role.</p>

<p>In times like this, and perhaps in all times, we have to
"follow the money." We must conclude that our basic role is that
which our funding mandates. Previously that mandate was embodied
in the compact between the community and its libraries and
museums, which identified the basic expectations and obligations
of those institutions. This compact called for responsible
stewardship, i.e., the care, preservation, and accessibility of
the collections and holdings entrusted to the library.</p>

<p>This compact, albeit often an implied one, derived largely
from the statutory obligations of non-profit organizations and
the inherent conditions of public funding. The revenue foregone
by the state and federal governments through exempting from
taxation the income of charitable corporations and charitable
trusts, i.e., non-profits, is foregone on two conditions, one
explicit and one implied. The explicit condition was that there
be no return to the private benefit of the officers of the
organization itself, i.e., that there be no profits received by
those controlling the organization.</p>

<p>The reasoning was that in the absence of the profit motive the
officers of the corporation would operate the trust in a way that
would be "above the market," would serve higher, charitable
purposes or the public interest. Hence, the implied condition.
Orphans would be fed, the young educated, and society improved
through history and culture. Where libraries and museums fit into
this scheme was as the repositories of knowledge and preservers
of cultural patrimony on behalf of the community.</p>

<p>Similarly public funds, the other major source of funding for
cultural institutions, were disbursed for the purpose of
improving the greater good of the commonweal, be that nation,
state or municipality. Public funds were used to improve the
capabilities of American society at large, or even to improve the
quality of life (graft, pork-barrel budgets, and corporate
welfare notwithstanding). This made good sense not only civic
terms but in terms of enhancing the competitiveness of American
society in the world economy.</p>

<p>Hence, in receiving philanthropic or public funds libraries
and museums incur a debt to the commonweal, a fiduciary role.
Their obligation as publicly supported institutions (directly
through public funds or indirectly through tax-exemption)
involved the long-term preservation and security of cultural
materials; making those materials available to a general audience
or to the supporting community; and a general accountability to
their supporting community. This is a nineteenth century model,
very much adapted to nineteenth century values and economics, and
to the world of the concrete asset.</p>

<p>But how does this apply in the new realm? Given our vastly
expanded capabilities for delivering information and culture, we
ask, what are the basic things that we owe to society? What do we
do first and foremost? Does the stewardship role, in fact, apply
when we are dealing not with things but with intangibles, and
when we are working in a global environment rather than serving a
contained community?</p>

<p>In our search for answers it is interesting to look at that
larger world that we share with the for-profits: not the Internet
but the global economy. There are powerful forces at work there
that are driving the changes in our little subset of that domain.
Especially interesting are the stories of two industries: energy
and banking, industries that have changed radically over the past
century. While both industries are quite alien to the traditional
museum and library worlds, they possess two important
similarities. For one thing, both deal with resources. Second,
their stewardship of these resources has a direct bearing on the
welfare of society, so much so that each have necessarily evolved
a robust regulatory apparatus.</p>

<p><b>The Energy Industry</b>. Much like libraries and other
cultural institutions most of today's energy companies began with
holdings of material assets: coal, oil, huge natural gas deposits
or minerals in the earth, which existed in a particular place.
Soon, industry leaders learned that they did not need to own the
ground in which those deposits were held, just lease it or better
yet simply own drilling rights to it. This was particularly
useful if those deposits were underneath federal land. (For this
the industry and the federal government had to "unbundle" the
idea of public ownership of the lands from ownership of the
minerals beneath.) Next, the oil companies, gas companies, and
power companies diversified and handled multiple sources of
energy, as a hedge against scarcity or glut of any single energy
type. Then they found that they could trade not only the
resources themselves but also the rights to those resources, and
even the value of future and undiscovered resources.</p>

<p>When the FTC began looking closely at Enron -- one of the
mammoth energy companies -- earlier this year in connection with
its acquisition by Dynegy, it discovered that it had become less
an energy company than an investment company trading in the
energy field. Enron's chief activity, it turned out, was
brokering rights and futures on natural resources and energy
reserves, more so than the buying and selling the resources
themselves. The holdings became almost immaterial. What became
most important was the company's ability to guarantee that those
leases, or rights, or options corresponded, ultimately, to real
resources somewhere. (In the end, aided it seems by their
auditors, Enron collapsed not because the amount of energy
resources they owned fell short, but because the link between
what they owned "on paper" and their real assets was
severed.)</p>

<p>Bear with me. Banks as well, began with holdings. They
originally bore an even closer resemblance to our libraries and
museums than did energy companies: storing wads of old paper and
things made of precious metals. Like libraries and museums, their
business was chiefly to take deposits and make loans. As the
world grew larger, and banks took an interest in the larger
community, money had to be moved greater distances and more
quickly. It became necessary for banks to deal not in moving
money around but to be able to transfer information about money
around, and to guarantee that money was where it was claimed to
be to validate that information. (If you have ever had to explain
to an eight-year-old how an ATM machine relates to the money in
your bank account, you will understand what I mean here.)</p>

<p>A convincing case for the inseparability (even
interchangeability) of money and technology in the global
environment is made in Thomas Friedman's book <i>The Lexus and
the Olive Tree</i>. Friedman talks about the speed at which
capital travels around the world through electronic technology.
Enabled by technology and accelerated by free trade agreements,
capital is drawn to markets rapidly by opportunities, or even
perceived opportunities, and can abandon those same markets just
as quickly (sometimes toppling local economies in the process),
while no currency is actually moved in the process.</p>

<p>These sectors have learned, and their recent histories
illustrate, that the distinction between materials, information,
and money are not fixed but fluid and permeable. They have
experienced a dematerialization of economic worth, the value of
intangibles, be they mineral and natural gas rights or
copyrights, the knowledge that there is oil in the ground or
access to networks for trading in that oil.</p>

<p>What is necessary to make this work, and this is much of the
important work in banking and energy, is maintenance of a complex
and extensive apparatus of validation and certification. That
apparatus certifies the value of the intangible commodity traded.
This apparatus consists of the agreements, licenses, leases, and
contracts. It includes regulatory oversight on the part of the
Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It also includes mechanisms for intra-industry third
party validation of worth, by organizations like Standard and
Poor, Dun and Bradstreet, and auditors such as Arthur Andersen.
Simply put, certitude has value.</p>

<p>Even outside the banking and energy industries the coin of the
realm, so to speak, is increasingly an intangible one. This was
recognized in the Brookings Institution's study last year on the
valuation of intangible assets in American businesses, and the
IRS is now weighing reasons to adjust some of its practices to
reflect the tremendous value that exists in non-brick and mortar
properties such as patents and copyrights.</p>

<p>But what does this have to do with stewardship, or with
museums and libraries? I believe that the fact that our economic
system values these things in the same ways that it used to value
gold, and later currency, suggests that our stewardship
responsibility should apply as strictly to digital resources as
they do to the funds that we receive from the federal government
and from other benefactors, and to the tangible cultural property
that resides in our collections</p>

<p>What does this mean for libraries? Clearly it means that we
must manage and preserve the digital resources that we create and
acquire, just as we manage and grow the funds entrusted to us and
the cultural heritage materials in our care. This responsibility,
I would argue, is less like traditional preservation than it is
like resource or even fund management. It is so unlike
traditional preservation, in fact, that that term hardly applies.
In effect, the challenge is not only to protect and preserve the
object itself, but also to protect the worth or usability of that
object. With cultural materials this worth depends upon more than
its continued functionality. In an environment of easy
replication and versioning, worth also depends on its
authenticity, on that link between the digital derivative and its
source document, be that a real manuscript, photograph, text, or
other kind of object, or a born-digital creation.</p>

<p>Here museums and libraries face a far more complex set of
circumstances and contingencies than we did with traditional
preservation, which is successful just by preventing change in
the composition of the object. Preserving the digital resource
means guaranteeing its functionality and authenticity, and hence
its value to the community. Certitude is essential to this
value.</p>

<p>As in banking and energy, robust infrastructure is necessary
to support this certitude. A part of this infrastructure consists
of the servers, networks, hardware, and technology that support
storage and use of the resources. But preserving the worth of
digital resources also depends upon a larger infrastructure of
validation and certification comparable to those that are in
place in banking and energy. This is the system of warrantees,
agreements, licenses, protocols, and other documentation,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the rights agreements that permit the continued and
"downstream" usability and, as necessary, modification of the
digital object, without which that object becomes useless;</li>

<li>licenses that allow use of the software that drives or
enables the object;</li>

<li>the metadata for a converted document in which the
evidentiary link between the digital derivative and its parts, or
between the digital derivative and its original source document,
is preserved;</li>

<li>partnership agreements that define obligations for storage,
migration, and other maintenance obligations which will quite
often be performed in a distributed way.</li>
</ul>

<p>The integrity of these materials is every bit as important as
our ability to insure that a digital artwork, database, or
digital collection will still work in future technological
platforms. In short, the infrastructure of digital preservation
is itself increasingly informational and contractual.</p>

<p>As in energy and banking, stewardship of resources in the
cultural world will require locating and strengthening this
underwriting capability, to provide the insurance policies that
guarantee the survival of worth. Our work has already become
highly contract-intensive. Given the intangibles with which we
are dealing, and the increasingly distributed nature of
preservation activity, we will have to build more of an apparatus
or framework for validation or certification than we presently
have. There will need to be better and more auditable
documentation of commitments for domain-specific preservation or
long-term responsibilities for migration.</p>

<p>There needs to be brokering and underwriting, by verifiably
disinterested parties, of those commitments and obligations. Not
so much to monitor, but to ensure that the resources will be
sustained: a kind of functional cross between Lloyd's of London
and Underwriters' Laboratories. As in the for-profit world
transparency will be required to lend credibility to this
function. The loyalties and allegiances of underwriters will have
to be above reproach. We will have to identify or create the
entity or entities that will carry out this role. It is a role
that government cannot fulfill, because in the area of
information security and cultural policy the government will
always be suspect. Moreover, if we "follow the money" that
supports our work to its source it is the community, not the
government, to whom we are beholden.</p>

<p>I think that this is what stewardship means in the digital
realm. What the community entrusts us with used to be
collections, now it is other resources. The cultural heritage
that we preserve is now less in the form of tangible materials,
i.e., collections. Our "collections" now increasingly consist of
a tenuous network/web of relationships, licenses, agreements, and
other contingencies whose survival requires a different kind of
diligence and attention if they are to endure. If this is true it
is incumbent upon us, one could argue even a core function, to
insure to the community that there is a "there, there," and that
it will continue to be "there" in the future. To do this better
we can look at the comparable fields, like energy and banking,
that have shifted from custodianship of hard resources to soft.
They are ahead of us, their evolution having been accelerated by
market forces.</p>

<p>We should look to them for guidance, not for models. I doubt
that there is any market interest whatsoever that will guarantee
the protection of the worth of the digital cultural resources
that we are creating and archiving. This is a quintessentially
non-profit function, and its development and maintenance is an
imperative for the library community. This supporting framework
of certification and validation defines our stewardship role in
the digital realm. Because it will, in the end, determine whether
or not our resources retain their value to society, or whether
they ultimately go dark. 1111 DLF abstract reilly Page 1
