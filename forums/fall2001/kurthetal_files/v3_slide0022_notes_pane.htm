  integrates Search and Browse on the same screen.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">  </span>Users can enter their search term above or browse below. This
  ability to search and browse within the same screen is powerful, but it can
  also be confusing. In addition, once users have entered search terms on this
  screen, they can browse from the next screen.<span style="mso-spacerun:
  yes">  </span>As they proceed through several screens, they may not
  understand the dual capability and may want to retrace their footsteps.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The clue I showed you in the red bar for
  “Parents of Evening Grosbeak” would only help users identify their very last
  step and would not lead them back over their entire navigational path.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Release 2.0 will include some navigational
  aids, such as breadcrumbs, particularly at the object level.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It will also include separate screens for
  Search and Browse, which should meet the needs of both browsers and searchers
  better.</font><br>
