  object record for the Core Historical Literature of Agriculture, one of the
  resources in the Cornell Gateway e-Reference Collection.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though the e-Reference records are also
  loaded in a single repository, the granularity of this repository’s contents
  varies more widely than that of the pamphlet collection.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And though this resource is represented as
  a single object within ENCompass, it is actually a collection unto
  itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though the e-Reference
  Collection is relatively heterogeneous, resources in it do share some common
  characteristics that can be conveyed through the display.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As reference resources, they tend to bring
  bodies of information together in a single point of entry, and, as such, they
  tend to be of larger granularity, certainly larger than pamphlets.<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are developing a logo to represent the
  e-Reference Collection in our Library Gateway, so, at minimum, we could
  include that logo in the ENCompass object display for e-Reference resources
  to alert users to the kind of resource they are seeing on the screen.</font><br>
