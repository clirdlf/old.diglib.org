<h2><a id="bground" name="bground"></a>Project genesis and
background</h2>

<p>The DFAS project sought to establish an architecture and build
a prototype for distributed finding aid searching at a number of
DLF institutions. Distributed access to finding aids created and
housed at a number of different institutions is an important
component in building a viable digital library.</p>

<p>The project began with the recognition that finding aids
encoded in SGML are proving to be a significant part of the
metadata strategy in the emerging digital library. The Encoded
Archival Description (EAD) DTD used for the SGML markup of
finding aids allows for considerable diversity of practice and
does not prescribe a particular approach to encoding a finding
aid. The diversity of SGML markup of finding aids has at least
two dimensions: the organization of the markup, and the detail in
encoding. In the first case, different institutions may choose
different approaches to encoding the intellectual structure of
their documents (the order and type of tags applied to the text),
leading to sometimes disparate results when rendered online, and
to potential problems identifying the location of elements for
indexing. In the second case, institutions may choose different
practices regarding how much markup to use (for example of names,
dates, places, etc.) in their documents, leading to differences
of search results.</p>

<p>The RLG Archival Collection Guides search system takes a
hybrid approach to this problem. Markup is not prescribed
(although RLG does publish guidelines that strongly suggest the
use of some tags), finding aids are periodically gathered from
local institutions using a web spider, and full SGML display from
the local institution is a selectable option. Even so, this
system still exhibits the primary problems of trying to
homogenize search and display of finding aids across
institutions: display of finding aids from some institutions
omits some sections that were marked up in unexpected ways; and
indexing works inconsistently across the collection, leading to
unexpected search results. Another significant feature of the RLG
implementation is the lack of ability to retrieve portions of a
finding aid. Especially as these collections grow richer, the
possibility of encountering large finding aids (e.g., several
hundred pages) will make the prospect of transferring the entire
finding aid as a result unattractive. Moreover, this sort of
imprecise feedback to the user undermines part of the value of
having used structured encoding. Finally, the RLG model both
removes local control of display and behavior <em>and</em>
removes some of the impetus for the community of stakeholders to
arrive at a consensus about practice and standards.</p>

<p>The DFAS participants believe that many larger institutions
will demand the greater flexibility of defining their own markup
practices using the EAD (which we know to be desirable in the
heterogeneous world of archival finding aids), and will want to
provide a search interface to their finding aid collections that
best reflects that practice and the collections represented. In
order to test possibilities for accommodating this diversity of
markup practice and the ability of institutions to house their
own finding aids in their own digital library systems, while
still allowing searching across institutional collections, we
have built a prototype instance of a Distributed Finding Aids
Server (DFAS).</p>

<h2><a id="overview" name="overview"></a>Overview of project</h2>

<p>In the original project proposal we asserted that at the end
of the project we hoped to have learned</p>

<ol>
<li>Whether or not distributed searching is a reasonable model
for cross-collection searching of SGML-encoded finding aids;</li>

<li>What indexes are minimally useful in a cross-collection
search of encoded finding aids;</li>

<li>What are useful approaches to handling indexing across
diversely encoded finding aids to ensure reasonable search
results;</li>

<li>What are useful approaches to managing intermediate result
sets from cross-collection searches using the distributed
model;</li>

<li>What are useful approaches to managing extremely large
finding aids by presenting them as navigable structures, and what
are the display screens needed to make this useful;</li>

<li>How do we optimize display across heterogeneously encoded
finding aids to ensure consistent results;</li>
</ol>

<p>As part of our fourth goal, we committed to exploring
questions like: what should be the behavior and appearance of
such a cross-collection search? Should the user be presented with
a WebZ-style set of results (e.g., six hits in collection A;
twenty hits in collection B; eight hits in collection C)? When
should the system begin to display actual results grouped by
institution? Should the system ever try to integrate results from
disparate collections into one merged list?</p>

<p>In the past eighteen months, in order to meet these goals,
project staff at the University of Michigan Library&rsquo;s
Digital Library Production Service have</p>

<ul>
<li>written the middleware to facilitate search and display of
the finding aids</li>

<li>collected 330 finding aids from the participant institutions
to populate the system</li>

<li>visited each of the participant institutions to install and
configure the system software</li>

<li>coordinated the selection of a set of trial common access
points</li>

<li>designed and refined the display of search results</li>
</ul>

<p>The project culminated with a meeting of representatives of
the participating institutions in April of 1999 (see list of
participants). At that meeting, the participants revisited issues
of distributed searching, resolved several outstanding questions
regarding the use of Common Access Points, evaluated the methods
in place for display of results and made recommendations for the
final report, as well as suggested directions for further
research.</p>

<h2><a id="search" name="search"></a><font size="5">Distributed
searching vs. searching locally replicated databases
<b></b></font></h2>

<p>In our discussions throughout the project, we have leaned
toward the view that the network transport issue of cross
collection search is tertiary to the cross collection query
expression process and the results behavior. Although we
recognized the importance of studying the transportation problems
raised by searching across geographically distributed
collections, our belief was that we first need to devise methods
for integrative searching of the collections. If we are unable to
do so successfully, the transportation issues will be moot.
Although this assumption was correct and necessary in order to
proceed with the system development, it underestimated, as is
discussed below, the importance of distribution as part of query
expression and results behavior.</p>

<p>Initially creating local copies of the databases did not in
any way preclude or exclude geographical distribution of the
collections and true broadcast searching. The mechanisms used to
get the databases to cooperate at a short distance should work at
a long distance, but initial problems and impediments were easier
to spot and resolve with locally stored copies. In addition,
while developers were learning how the system should and did
work, we believed local copies would be a convenience.</p>

<p>We proposed that each institution have the same kind of base
middleware, installed and configured by the DLPS programming
staff, and each institution host its own (crawler produced)
copies of the collections. Moreover, each institution has control
over its own search interface and display engine. The
institutions were welcome to make use of the DLPS search and
display prototypes, but we assumed that they would want to do
some customization to meet local needs. Thus, each institution
holds a current version of the institution's own database of
finding aids, and a relatively recent, crawled version of the
other institutions' databases, a complete vocabulary map, the
general DFAS middleware, and the local customizations. Each
institution also has in place local policies as to whether the
local or remote databases will be searched, dependent on factors
such as response time, time of day, or current demand on local
resources. Local policies also govern how often the databases of
other participants are replicated.</p>

<p>At the DFAS project meeting, a number of concerns were raised
about the value of <i>replication</i> as opposed to a
<i>distributed search</i>. For example, the participants from
Oxford pointed out that the costs of replication (storage space,
the cycles needed to re-index) may be nearly or as high as the
costs of true distributed searching. The most important issue
raised, however, was a methodological one: by using replication,
we remove local control and the relevance of such features as
CAPS (see elsewhere). While the distributed approach uses
mechanisms like the CAPS to bridge local encoding practice and
generalized methods for retrieval, the use of replication takes
the idiosyncrasies of local encoding practices and moves them
whole cloth into another institution&rsquo;s server without the
mediating interpretation of the originating institution.
Importantly, a focus on distributed search, with mechanisms like
CAPS, at least theoretically allows other search engines and
indexing practices to be included (thus the importance of
articulating an API for this layer of the DFAS system). The group
felt, overwhelmingly, that distribution and replication were
<i>not</i> equivalent, as had been asserted in the proposal, and
that further work should focus primarily on distribution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, replication has significant value where the
institution that has created finding aids is not able to mount an
effective system for retrieval, or where consortial interests are
strong. The group posited several alternatives that might be
explored to alleviate some of those costs, such as the creation
of national or regional nodes of finding aids which could be
indexed and searched more economically than if these activities
were conducted at each institution, or the creation of mirror
sites. The group discussion also led to the recognition that
there is information about the finding aids that needs to be
conveyed as well as the finding aids themselves. For example,
flagging new and revised finding aids might save some of the cost
of replicating the entirety of all the databases at each
replication period. Finally, we need a means of communicating to
users when replication and re-indexing last took place so that
they will know whether there is new material available to their
searches.</p>

<p>These questions are of considerable value in the pursuit of
access to distributed and diverse finding aids and worthy of
further consideration. While our decision to use local copies of
the databases was necessary in order to focus on resolving
problems of cross collection search and display, a true
distributed search holds much more promise in simultaneously
facilitating the diversity of practice at the local level
<i>and</i> ensuring that users are able to search the holdings of
dozens of institutions from a single interface. Both distributed
searching and replication have value for providing access to
finding aids at a large number of institutions; finding the best
use for each is an important area of future investigation.</p>

<h2><a id="cap" name="cap"></a><font size="5">Common Access
Points</font></h2>

<p>One of the main goals of this project was to begin
experimentation with the concept of distributed searching across
heterogeneous collections of EAD-encoded finding aids. The idea
was to see whether a Z39.50-type approach could be successful
with this type of material, as opposed to the union catalog
approach. Lacking a Z39.50 profile for finding aids, we began the
project by defining a set of "Common Access Points" (CAPs) which
would be available at each participating institution for use in
the DFAS search interface. These CAPs would represent "indexes"
which would be given generic, or "synthetic" names in the system
but which could be called whatever seemed appropriate in the
local institution&rsquo;s DFAS interface. These CAPs are
essential to create a generalized layer of access that was not
specific to any one institution nor to any one method of
encoding.</p>

<p>One project goal has been that each institution could define
the EAD elements to be included under the various synthetic names
however they saw fit (as is done in Z39.50). Initially it was
necessary to prescribe which EAD elements would be included under
each synthetic name. This raised the problem of having two sets
of indexes in the local interface: one for the locally defined
indexes and one for DFAS. In Harvard&rsquo;s case this led to the
existence of two access points named "Name (people and
organizations)", each containing a different set of EAD elements.
In an effort to identify this difference for users, Harvard
changed the name of the DFAS access point. The same was true at
Harvard for the "Titles" access point, since the DFAS definition
of this index is all types of titles, while Harvard&rsquo;s is
just the titles of works found in the collections. This duality
of access points and their definitions makes local interface
design and user education difficult.</p>

<p>The trade off, however, is clear. In both scenarios the
underlying finding aids differ from institution to institution in
structure, content, and choice of EAD markup. If local
institutions can define what <i>they</i> mean by one of the CAPs
(by mapping it to a local index) then a DFAS search might
retrieve completely different things at two different
institutions. This is something which happens often in the Z39.50
world and is considered a significant flaw in that technology.
The variability of underlying EAD markup makes the problem far
worse for finding aids. But if local institutions are required to
create special DFAS access points which are used by the DFAS
interface then there is no logical difference from the union
catalog case. The best option would seem to be allowing each
institution to define its own contribution to each CAP, but to
continue the discussion among all participants about the
usefulness of each CAP and why they should or should not include
various eligible EAD elements. The CAPs and the EAD elements they
include could be used as a starting point for that discussion. To
begin and stimulate this discussion, as well as to develop a
working production system, a <a
href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/dlps/dfas/capwp.html">white
paper</a> was produced describing the issues involved in this
effort, and discussing the current use of access points at the
five institutions. It was discovered that even among just five
institutions using the same OpenText software there was wide
variation in definition. After brief discussion, <a
href="http://www.umdl.umich.edu/dlps/dfas/dfascaps.html">a set of
nine CAPs</a> were chosen to begin with, which are listed
below.</p>

</table>

<p><b>Comments on the above:</b></p>

<p><b>Names</b></p>

<p>In EAD, generic identifiers which include the term NAME cover
general names &lt;NAME&gt;, family names &lt;FAMNAME&gt;,
personal names &lt;PERSNAME&gt;, corporate names
&lt;CORPNAME&gt;, and places &lt;GEOGNAME&gt;. Thus place names
appear in three CAPs: Names, Places, and Subjects, while all
types of names show up in the Names CAP and the Subjects CAP.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether users will consider place names to be
a type of "name" such that &lt;GEOGNAME&gt; should be included in
the Names CAP, nor is it known whether users will distinguish
names as such versus names as subjects. In an effort to
accommodate all user assumptions we left this CAP very inclusive,
but in order to test the utility of a more restrictive CAP the
most recent version of the system will define a "Controlled
Names" CAP to include the *NAME elements in a CONTROLACCESS
element (usually limited to AACR2 forms of names, and only those
important to the collection).</p>

<p><b>Subjects</b></p>

<p>There is little consensus about what kinds of data from the
finding aid should be included. For example, the folder titles
found in finding aid container lists (tagged as
&lt;UNITTITLE&gt;) provide a sort of subject access but were not
included here. In fact, almost every element of the finding aid
might be considered eligible for this access point. And there is,
to complicate matters, a &lt;SUBJECT&gt; element in the EAD for
those terms or phrases that the encoder feel to be particularly
important, as a subject, in the finding aid. There seem to be two
approaches to this: restrictive and inclusive. In the first, the
Subjects CAP would include only the &lt;SUBJECT&gt; elements
(similar to the definition of the Places CAP to include only
&lt;GEOGNAME&gt; elements). In the second, it would include
everything that might be considered a subject by a user. In the
former, there is no ambiguity but if the encoder did not choose
to use the &lt;SUBJECT&gt; element often valuable information
might be inaccessible. In the latter, Subjects becomes almost
synonymous with the Anywhere CAP, and it would be difficult to
educate users as to when to use one over the other. Another
school of thought was to eliminate this CAP as being too
ambiguous to be useful.</p>

<p>Currently the Subject CAP has been left in place, in an effort
to give users as much access as possible. At the April meeting,
we agreed to remove the GENREFORM and PHYSDESC elements from the
CAP, since these seemed to be clearly outside the scope of
traditional subject indexes. In order to test the usefulness of
the inclusive versus restrictive Subjects CAP we will create
another "Controlled Subjects" CAP which will include all SUBJECT,
OCCUPATION, and *NAME elements found in the CONTROLACCESS
element.</p>

<p><b>Titles</b></p>

<p>A Titles CAP should be carefully defined to include only the
set of title types that fit together logically. The concept of a
title is somewhat complicated in EAD, since there are four
distinct types of titles to be considered: the title of the
collection (&lt;ARCHDESC&gt;&lt;DID&gt;&lt;UNITTITLE&gt;), the
title of the finding aid itself (&lt;TITLEPROPER&gt;), the title
of each folder in the collection
(&lt;DSC&gt;&lt;C&gt;&lt;&lt;DID&gt;&lt;UNITTITLE&gt;), and
titles of works which may be contained in the collection
(&lt;TITLE&gt;). Each of these has different uses, and in
particular the last title type (work titles contained in the
collection) would be considered by most researchers to be very
different from the first three types. UNITTITLE is now excluded
from this CAP, which will restrict it to titles found in the
collection rather than folder titles which are largely invented
by the collection processor.</p>

<p><b>Dates</b></p>

<p>Dates are indisputably valuable in searching finding aids, but
until we have consistent methods for expressing or normalizing
dates that value will be undermined by our practices. "Dates" is
another CAP that could be eliminated to avoid confusion, or more
tightly constrained to include one single (required) date in the
underlying finding aids (for example, the collection dates which
are found in the &lt;ARCHDESC&gt;&lt;DID&gt;&lt;UNITDATE&gt;
element). "Dates" is a notoriously difficult access point to
define in databases which contain "natural" language documents,
as opposed to databases with tightly constrained schemas which
control when dates are used and how they are represented. In
finding aids dates may (or may not) appear in many forms (ex.
January 1, 1900; 1/1/00; Jan 1 &lsquo;00, 1900-01,
&lsquo;00-&rsquo;01, Jan - Dec 1900, etc.). Most SGML-based
systems do not even attempt to normalize dates for indexing
unless they appear in a very particular way (ex. 1900-1910 might
be indexed as a range, with each intervening year indexed
separately). Furthermore, many finding aids do not contain useful
dates in all the places where they might occur, or they contain
the dates but they were not encoded as such in EAD. All of this
leads to confusion by users who try to limit their searches to a
particular date, year, or year range. Using all the dates found
in the finding aid and tagged as such optimizes access by users
to this information, but at the cost of confusion as to what is
included and when. and may produce misleading results if the
system didn't recognize a useful date and reported no hits to the
user.</p>

<p><b>Content and Summary</b></p>

<p>These are both CAPs which include structural components of the
finding aids. In the first case it covers the section of the
finding aid called the "container list" or "inventory", and in
the second case it covers the descriptive frontmatter of the
finding aid, which puts the collection in a context and provides
background information on it. Whether users will understand these
structural distinctions and how well particular finding aids
conform to this structure, remains to be seen. These CAPs may be
eliminated after further study.</p>

<h2><a id="results" name="results"></a><font size="5">Display and
navigation of results</font></h2>

<p>If the CAPs facilitate successful search and retrieval of
diversely encoded finding aids, the question of how to display
the results of this search still remains. We would like to
institute a three-tiered display of results that is based upon a
set of configurable policies. Navigation of the results will be
enabled by a frames-based HTML display. The three tiers will
be:</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Summary level</i>: The summary level will give a
high-level hits summary indicating both total number of matches
in total number of finding aids and matches grouped by
institution. The user will have the option of viewing all the
matching finding aids from a single institution or moving into
the index level for a view of all finding aids. The summary
screen will appear in the left-hand navigational frame and will
remain constant throughout the user&rsquo;s interaction with this
set of search results (i.e. until "new search" is selected).</li>

<li><i>Results list level</i>: The results list will be a list of
matches either clustered by institution or merged and ordered
alphabetically. The ordering principle of the results list will
be decided upon by each participating institution and configured
in its middleware. Selecting a match from the results list will
take the user to the record level results.</li>

<li><i>Record level</i>: Record level retrieval returns a "hits
in context" view of the finding aid. (At this point the user can
choose to go directly to the pertinent part of the finding aid,
retrieve an outline view of the entire finding aid, or view the
full text of the finding aid).</li>
</ol>

<p>This record level "hits in context" view is central to DFAS's
commitment to enabling user retrieval of part of a finding aid.
At the participant meeting it became clear that this was an area
of investigation that we had not staked out thoroughly enough. We
believe that this display should be embedded in a structural view
of the finding aid and recognize that the system needs a way of
advocating this. One of the concluding pieces of work on the
system has been the configuration of the middleware so as to make
this view a default that has to be over-ridden rather than an
option that can be locally activated.</p>

<p>Key to this approach is the notion of setting policies to
indicate which level of display of results is appropriate. If
there is only one match on a search, we may well want to display
that finding aid directly. If there are several matches but all
from one institution, we will want the system to immediately
provide a results list level display in the right-hand,
content-bearing frame. Rather than impose arbitrary threshold
numbers that may or may not make sense given variable local user
needs, we would like to make the numbers configurable at the
local level. For example, one institution might choose to move
from results list level to summary level when the number of hits
exceeds 25, while another might not make that switch until there
are more than 100 hits. All institutions will have these multiple
views available to them; how to employ them will be a local
decision. Similarly, if an institution would like to avoid
dependence on frames-based display, the system can be configured
locally to choose among the display levels depending on the
number of matches to a query.</p>

<p>In discussions at the project meeting and in some local
discussions at the University of Michigan with archivists, the
point has been repeatedly raised that the institution may well
not be the primary point of intellectual identification for the
researcher -- instead it may be the archive, particularly when an
institution hosts multiple archives. EAD markup supports
identification of archives, but in practice this is not widely or
consistently used. We need to consider whether there is anything
we can do to provide for representation by archive rather than
institution and what kind of context can we provide for users to
make informed choices about which institutions to search.</p>

<h2><a id="fa" name="fa"></a><font size="5">Display and
navigation of finding aids</font></h2>

<p>The display of the finding aids themselves has not been a high
priority for the DFAS project. We believe that rendering in HTML
will disappear as an implementation problem. Moreover, our
experience has led us to believe that, though not without faults,
our current methods are <i>good enough</i> and that problems of
search and navigation are much more compelling. That said, we
have considered it important to accommodate a variety of methods
and local practices for display within the system.</p>

<p>The majority of finding aids in the DFAS system now make use
of on-the-fly conversion from SGML to HTML. This display is
predicated upon the belief that an effective system makes
available multiple views. We also believe that is central to both
intellectual and system efficiency for users to have the ability
to navigate to and retrieve a selected portion of a finding aid.
This is particularly important in the case of very large finding
aids; for example, one of the finding aids in the test system is
almost two megabytes in size, the Bentley Historical Library's
Milliken finding aid is over 500 pages in print, and Oxford
reports that some of their finding aids also run several hundred
pages.</p>

<p>The key word or "hits" in context display supports retrieval
of the relevant portion of the finding aid and navigation to
other levels of the finding aid (the user can go up or down
levels in the hierarchy). Moreover, if the user has decided
through searching or browsing that an entire finding aid is
useful, that user has a choice of views. An outline view displays
an outline of the finding aid and the intellectual organization
of the contents list. The outline view is the most suitable for
browsing through a finding aid. Each of the sections of the
finding aid can be unfolded as desired. So, for example, a
Contents List organizes the records into Subgroups, Series and
Subseries (as appropriate for a particular collection), each of
which can be expanded down to the level at which the container
element (box, drawer, reel etc.) appears in the finding aid.</p>

<p>Finally, for those users who do wish to view the entire
contents of a finding aid, a full text view is available. This
view retrieves the full text of the finding aid as a single
document. It may contain features such as: a more formally
formatted title page; the "Collection Scope and Content Note"
displaying both the collection level scope and content note and
compiling the series scope and content notes (which are
physically located in the contents list) into a single narrative
text; the Series scope and content notes also displayed in the
contents list section; display of the entire list of "Controlled
Access Terms." All of this can and will depend on local decisions
about the full text display. At present in the DFAS system, there
are no internal navigation tools in the full text view. The user
must move though the finding aid with the scroll bar or
page-up/page-down keys; the full text view might be improved with
some internal navigation such as a linked TOC.</p>

<p>The DFAS system also allows for handcrafted HTML rendering of
the finding aids, a method that Columbia has chosen to employ and
that has the advantage of making possible a much more handsome
display. This does, however, lose the ability to display the
search results in context and thus allow a user to move
immediately to the relevant portion of a finding aid. This is a
sacrifice of functionality, but allows for a high degree of
control over the display.</p>

<p>Finally, the DFAS system supports the display of finding aids
using XSL stylesheets. At present, only Microsoft Explorer 5.0
supports this type of display; we continue to expect, however,
that XML capable browsers will soon be widely available. Making
use of XSL stylesheets will solve many of the problems and
decisions associated with display of EAD encoded finding aids.
This will also allow a high degree of flexibility. Using
stylesheets, the system can provide a default style. The local
institution can override this with an archive or institution
specific stylesheet, and users can rebel and apply their own
stylesheets, overriding all the others. Moreover, as a test
implementation at Cornell demonstrates, XSL stylesheets can be
effectively combined with the use of HTML to facilitate
navigation.</p>

<h2><a id="concl" name="concl"></a><font size="5">Conclusions and
directions for further research</font></h2>

<p><font size="3">In sum, the project has established that it is
possible to implement a distributed search of diversely encoded
finding aids and to obtain meaningful results. It has explored
alternative methods of searching multiple databases (remote
searching and replication) of finding aids and has laid out
advantages and disadvantages of both methods. The system supports
a flexible and multi-faceted display of results and of the
finding aids themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The system consists of two discernible
components: 1) a distributed search management layer and 2) local
indexing and access middleware. The system designers have come to
believe that, as written, the distributed search management can
not scale to include a large number of institutions and archives
within institutions, as well as a far greater number of finding
aids. As currently written (in Perl) the system is weak on
elements of interprocess communication that will become
increasingly important as the number of sites grows. The local
indexing and access middleware is, however, very capable in
handling the search and retrieval of a large number of finding
aids from any one repository. It is an excellent production tool
for digital libraries with collections of finding aids and we
hope that it will be used in such environments. Moreover, the
current system also provides a testbed for research on user
expectations and behavior in interacting with finding aids and
with searching across multiple institutions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We recognize the need for further exploration
of the following areas.</font></p>

<ol>
<li>Collect user feedback: It is essential to know how the system
works with real archivists and researchers. While we were unable
to conduct user testing within the project period, Harvard has
committed to a period of testing and evaluation in the next six
months.</li>

<li>Discuss methods and rules for date normalization; exploration
of the possibility of using controlled access terms for dates.
Searching on dates is central to archival research and needs to
be better supported.</li>

<li>Conduct statistical studies on retrieval dependent on
different CAPs mappings (that is, which EAD elements should be
mapped to which access point)</li>

<li>Development of middleware in language more aware of
interprocess communication</li>

<li>Explore possibility of using nodes to facilitate
"semi-distributed" searching</li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3">DLPS will continue to support the distributed
search management layer for a small number of institutions and
thus the system will be available for use in research and
experimentation on issues such as numbers 2 and 3 above. DLPS
would welcome such research and would be glad to engage in
discussions with researchers as to how best we can support that.
DLPS will also continue to support the DFAS middleware as a
production tool, available through the revamped SGML Server
Program.</font></p>

<h2><a id="notes" name="notes"></a>Notes</h2>

<p><a id="note1" name="note1">1</a> Greg Kinney, as archivist at
the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library has noted
"The Summary synthetic term has &lt;ARCHDESC&gt; as the sole
included element. in fact, that makes it virtually the same as
Anywhere (Anywhere would also include
&lt;FRONTMATTER&gt;&lt;TITTLEPAGE&gt;) If Summary is intended to
be the narrative description portion of the finding aid the
included elements should probably be &lt;ARCHDESC&gt; minus
&lt;DSC&gt; and &lt;ADD&gt; Even that formulation poses a
problem, since in some practices the series &lt;SCOPECONTENT&gt;
notes are physically located inside the &lt;DSC&gt;. Maybe it
will be best to positively state that the Summary synthetic term
will include the top level &lt;DID&gt;, &lt;ADMININFO&gt;,
&lt;BIOGHIST&gt;, &lt;SCOPECONTENT&gt; and
&lt;CONTROLACCESS&gt;(?) elements, regardless of whether they are
physically inside or outside the contents list.</p>
