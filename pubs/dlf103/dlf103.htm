      <blockquote>The <i>NARA Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access</i> define approaches for creating digital surrogates for facilitating access and reproduction; they are not considered appropriate
         for preservation reformatting to create surrogates that will replace original records. The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> presented here are based on the procedures used by the Digital Imaging Lab of NARA's Special Media Preservation Laboratory
         for digitizing archival records and the creation of production master image files, and are a revision of the 1998 "<i>NARA Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access</i>", which describes the imaging approach used for NARA's pilot Electronic Access Project.

      <blockquote>The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> are intended to be informative, and not intended to be prescriptive. We hope to provide a technical foundation for digitization
         activities, but further research will be necessary to make informed decisions regarding all aspects of digitizing projects.
         These guidelines provide a range of options for various technical aspects of digitization, primarily relating to image capture,
         but do not recommend a single approach.

      <blockquote>The intended audience for these guidelines includes those who will be planning, managing, and approving digitization projects,
         such as archivists, librarians, curators, managers, and others. Another primary audience includes those actually doing scanning
         and digital capture, such as technicians and photographers.

         In reviewing this document, please keep in mind the following:
         
         <li>The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> have been developed for internal NARA use, and for use by NARA with digitizing projects involving NARA holdings and other
            partner organizations. The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> support internal policy directive NARA 816 -- <i>Digitization Activities for Enhanced Access</i>, at <a href="http://www.nara-at-work.gov/nara_policies_and_guidance/directives/0800_series/nara816.html">http://www.nara-at-work.gov/nara_policies_and_guidance/directives/0800_series/nara816.html</a> (NARA internal link only). For digitization projects involving NARA holdings, all requirements in NARA 816 must be met or
            followed.
         </li>
         
         <li>The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> do not constitute, in any way, guidance to Federal agencies on records creation and management, or on the transfer of permanent
            records to the National Archives of the United States. For information on these topics, please see the Records Management
            section of the NARA website, at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records_management/index.html">http://www.archives.gov/records_management/index.html</a> and <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/erm_overview.html">http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/erm_overview.html</a>.
         </li>
         
         <li>As stated above, Federal agencies dealing with the transfer of scanned images of textual documents, of scanned images of photographs,
            and of digital photography image files as permanent records to NARA shall follow specific transfer guidance <a href="(http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/scanned_textual.html">(http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/scanned_textual.html</a> and <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/digital_photo_records.html">http://www.archives.gov/records_management/initiatives/digital_photo_records.html</a>) and the regulations in 36 CFR 1228.270.
         </li>
         
         <li>The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> cover only the process of digitizing archival materials for on-line access and hardcopy reproduction. Other issues must be
            considered when conducting digital imaging projects, including the long-term management and preservation of digital images
            and associated metadata, which are not addressed here. For information on these topics, please see information about NARA's
            Electronic Records Archive project, at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html</a>.
         </li>
         
         <li>The topics in these <i>Technical Guidelines</i> are inherently technical in nature. For those working on digital image capture and quality control for images, a basic foundation
            in photography and imaging is essential. Generally, without a good technical foundation and experience for production staff,
            there can be no claim about achieving the appropriate level of quality as defined in these guidelines.
         </li>
         
         <li>These guidelines reflect current NARA internal practices and we anticipate they will change over time. We plan on updating
            the <i>Technical Guidelines</i> on a regular basis. We welcome your comments and suggestions.

         <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      </center>
      
      
      <p>These <i>Guidelines</i> define approaches for creating digital surrogates for facilitating access and reproduction. They are not considered appropriate
         for preservation reformatting to create surrogates that will replace original records. For further discussion of the differences
         between these two approaches, see Appendix A, Digitization for Preservation vs. Production Masters.
      </p>
      
      <p>These guidelines provide technical benchmarks for the creation of "production master" raster image (pixel-based) files. Production
         masters are files used for the creation of additional derivative files for distribution and/or display via a monitor and for
         reproduction purposes via hardcopy output at a range of sizes using a variety of printing devices (see Appendix B, Derivative
         Files, for more information). Our aim is to use the production master files in an automated fashion to facilitate affordable
         reprocessing. Many of the technical approaches discussed in these guidelines are intended for this purpose.
      </p>
      
      <p>Production master image files have the following attributes -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>The primary objective is to produce digital images that look like the original records (textual, photograph, map, plan, etc.)
               and are a "reasonable reproduction" without enhancement. The <i>Technical Guidelines</i> take into account the challenges involved in achieving this and will describe best practices or methods for doing so.
            </li>
            
            <li>Production master files document the image at the time of scanning, not what it may once have looked like if restored to its
               original condition. Additional versions of the images can be produced for other purposes with different reproduction renderings.
               For example, sometimes the reproduction rendering intent for exhibition (both physical and on-line exhibits) and for publication
               allows basic enhancement. Any techniques that can be done in a traditional darkroom (contrast and brightness adjustments,
               dodging, burning, spotting, etc.) may be allowed on the digital images.
            </li>
            
            <li>Digitization should be done in a "use-neutral" manner, not for a specific output. Image quality parameters have been selected
               to satisfy most types of output.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         If digitization is done to meet the recommended image parameters and all other requirements as described in these <i>Technical Guidelines</i>, we believe the production master image files produced should be usable for a wide variety of applications and meet over
         95% of reproduction requests. If digitization is done to meet the alternative minimum image parameters and all other requirements,
         the production master image files should be usable for many access applications, particularly for web usage and reproduction
         requests for 8"x10" or 8.5"x11" photographic quality prints.
      </p>
      
      <p>If your intended usage for production master image files is different and you do not need all the potential capabilities of
         images produced to meet the recommended image parameters, then you should select appropriate image parameters for your project.
         In other words, your approach to digitization may differ and should be tailored to the specific requirements of the project.
      </p>
      
      <p>Generally, given the high costs and effort for digitization projects, we do not recommend digitizing to anything less than
         our alternative minimum image parameters. This assumes availability of suitable high-quality digitization equipment that meets
         the assessment criteria described below (see Quantifying Scanner/Digital Camera Performance) and produces image files that
         meet the minimum quality described in the <i>Technical Guidelines</i>. If digitization equipment fails any of the assessment criteria or is unable to produce image files of minimum quality, then
         it may be desirable to invest in better equipment or to contract with a vendor for digitization services.

      <p align="center"><i>-6-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Although there are many technical parameters discussed in these <i>Guidelines</i> that define a high-quality production master image file, we do not consider an image to be of high quality unless metadata
         is associated with the file. Metadata makes possible several key functions  --  the identification, management, access, use,
         and preservation of a digital resource -- and is therefore directly associated with most of the steps in a digital imaging
         project workflow: file naming, capture, processing, quality control, production tracking, search and retrieval design, storage,
         and long-term management. Although it can be costly and time-consuming to produce, metadata adds value to production master
         image files: images without sufficient metadata are at greater risk of being lost.
      </p>
      
      <p>No single metadata element set or standard will be suitable for all projects or all collections. Likewise, different original
         source formats (text, image, audio, video, etc.) and different digital file formats may require varying metadata sets and
         depths of description. Element sets should be adapted to fit requirements for particular materials, business processes and
         system capabilities.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because no single element set will be optimal for all projects, implementations of metadata in digital projects are beginning
         to reflect the use of "application profiles," defined as metadata sets that consist of data elements drawn from different
         metadata schemes, which are combined, customized and optimized for a particular local application or project. This "mixing
         and matching" of elements from different schemas allows for more useful metadata to be implemented at the local level while
         adherence to standard data values and structures is still maintained. Locally-created elements may be added as extensions
         to the profile, data elements from existing schemas might be modified for specific interpretations or purposes, or existing
         elements may be mapped to terminology used locally.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because of the likelihood that heterogeneous metadata element sets, data values, encoding schemes, and content information
         (different source and file formats) will need to be managed within a digital project, it is good practice to put all of these
         pieces into a broader context at the outset of any project in the form of a data or information model. A model can help to
         define the types of objects involved and how and at what level they will be described (i.e., are descriptions hierarchical
         in nature, will digital objects be described at the file or item level as well as at a higher aggregate level, how are objects
         and files related, what kinds of metadata will be needed for the system, for retrieval and use, for management, etc.), as
         well as document the rationale behind the different types of metadata sets and encodings used. A data model informs the choice
         of metadata element sets, which determine the content values, which are then encoded in a specific way (in relational database
         tables or an XML document, for example).
      </p>
      
      <p>Although there is benefit to recording metadata on the item level to facilitate more precise retrieval of images within and
         across collections, we realize that this level of description is not always practical. Different projects and collections
         may warrant more in-depth metadata capture than others; a deep level of description at the item level, however, is not usually
         accommodated by traditional archival descriptive practices. The functional purpose of metadata often determines the amount
         of metadata that is needed. Identification and retrieval of digital images may be accomplished on a very small amount of metadata;
         however, management of and preservation services performed on digital images will require more finely detailed metadata  --
          particularly at the technical level, in order to render the file, and at the structural level, in order to describe the relationships
         among different files and versions of files.
      </p>
      
      <p>Metadata creation requires careful analysis of the resource at hand. Although there are current initiatives aimed at automatically
         capturing a given set of values, we believe that metadata input is still largely a manual process and will require human intervention
         at many points in the object's lifecycle to assess the quality and relevance of metadata associated with it.
      </p>
      
      <p>This section of the Guidelines serves as a general discussion of metadata rather than a recommendation of specific metadata
         element sets; although several elements for production master image files are suggested as minimum-level information useful
         for basic file management. We are currently investigating how we will implement and formalize technical and structural metadata
         schemes into our workflow and anticipate that this section will be updated on a regular basis.

         <h3>Common Metadata Types:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Several categories of metadata are associated with the creation and management of production master image files. The following
         metadata types are the ones most commonly implemented in imaging projects. Although these categories are defined separately
         below, there is not always an obvious distinction between them, since each type contains elements that are both descriptive
         and administrative in nature. These types are commonly broken down by what functions the metadata supports. In general, the
         types of metadata listed below, except for descriptive, are usually found "behind the scenes" in databases rather than in
         public access systems. As a result, these types of metadata tend to be less standardized and more aligned with local requirements.
      </p>

      <p align="center"><i>-7-</i></p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Descriptive -- </h4>
      
      <p>Descriptive metadata refers to information that supports discovery and identification of a resource (the who, what, when and
         where of a resource). It describes the content of the resource, associates various access points, and describes how the resource
         is related to other resources intellectually or within a hierarchy. In addition to bibliographic information, it may also
         describe physical attributes of the resource such as media type, dimension, and condition. Descriptive metadata is usually
         highly structured and often conforms to one or more standardized, published schemes, such as Dublin Core or MARC. Controlled
         vocabularies, thesauri, or authority files are commonly used to maintain consistency across the assignment of access points.
         Descriptive information is usually stored outside of the image file, often in separate catalogs or databases from technical
         information about the image file.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although descriptive metadata may be stored elsewhere, it is recommended that some basic descriptive metadata (such as a caption
         or title) accompany the structural and technical metadata captured during production. The inclusion of this metadata can be
         useful for identification of files or groups of related files during quality review and other parts of the workflow, or for
         tracing the image back to the original.
      </p>
      
      <p>Descriptive metadata is not specified in detail in this document; however, we recommend the use of the Dublin Core Metadata
         Element<a href="#a1"> [1]</a> set to capture minimal descriptive metadata information where metadata in another formal data standard does not exist. Metadata
         should be collected directly in Dublin Core; if it is not used for direct data collection, a mapping to Dublin Core elements
         is recommended. A mapping to Dublin Core from a richer, local metadata scheme already in use may also prove helpful for data
         exchange across other projects utilizing Dublin Core. Not all Dublin Core elements are required in order to create a valid
         Dublin Core record. However, we suggest that production master images be accompanied by the following elements at the very
         minimum:

         These selected elements serve the purpose of basic identification of a file. Additionally, the Dublin Core elements "Format"
         (describes data types) and "Type" (describes limited record types) may be useful in certain database applications where sorting
         or filtering search results across many record genres or data types may be desirable. Any local fields that are important
         within the context of a particular project should also be captured to supplement Dublin Core fields so that valuable information
         is not lost. We anticipate that selection of metadata elements will come from more than one preexisting element set -- elements
         can always be tailored to specific formats or local needs. Projects should support a modular approach to designing metadata
         to fit the specific requirements of the project. Standardizing on Dublin Core supplies baseline metadata that provides access
         to files, but this should not exclude richer metadata that extends beyond the Dublin Core set, if available.
      </p>
      
      <p>For large-scale digitization projects, only minimal metadata may be affordable to record during capture, and is likely to
         consist of linking image identifiers to page numbers and indicating major structural divisions or anomalies of the resource
         (if applicable) for text documents. For photographs, capturing caption information (and Still Photo identifier) is ideal.
         For other non-textual materials, such as posters and maps, descriptive information taken directly from the item being scanned
         as well as a local identifier should be captured. If keying of captions into a database is prohibitive, if possible scan captions
         as part of the image itself. Although this information will not be searchable, it will serve to provide some basis of identification
         for the subject matter of the photograph. Recording of identifiers is important for uniquely identifying resources and is
         necessary for locating and managing them. It is likely that digital images will be associated with more than one identifier
         -- for the image itself, for metadata or database records that describe the image, and for reference back to the original.

      <p><a name="a1"></a>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, (http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/dc/current-elements/). The Dublin Core element set is
         characterized by simplicity in creation of records, flexibility, and extensibility. It facilitates description of all types
         of resources and is intended to be used in conjunction with other standards that may offer fuller descriptions in their respective
         domains.<br><br></p>
      
      <p>For images to be entered into NARA's Archival Research Catalog (ARC), a more detailed complement of metadata is required.
         For a more detailed discussion of descriptive metadata requirements for digitization projects at NARA,

         we refer readers to NARA's Lifecycle Data Requirements Guide (LCDRG), at: <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research_room/arc/arc_info/lifecycle_data_requirements.doc">http://www.archives.gov/research_room/arc/arc_info/lifecycle_data_requirements.doc</a> (June 2004), and NARA internal link -- <a href="http://www.nara-at-work.gov/archives_and_records_mgmt/archives_and_activities/accessioning_processing_description/lifecycle/index.html">http://www.nara-at-work.gov/archives_and_records_mgmt/archives_and_activities/accessioning_processing_description/lifecycle/index.html</a> (January 2002), which contains data elements developed for the archival description portion of the records lifecycle, and
         associates these elements with many different hierarchical levels of archival materials from record groups to items. The LCDRG
         also specifies rules for data entry. The LCDRG also requires a minimum set of other metadata to be recorded for raster image
         files at the file level, including technical metadata that enables images to display properly in the ARC interface.
      </p>
      
      <p>Additionally, enough compatibility exists between Dublin Core and the data requirements that NARA has developed for archival
         description to provide a useful mapping between data elements, if a digital project requires that metadata also be managed
         locally (outside of ARC), perhaps in a local database or digital asset management system that supports data in Dublin Core.
         Please see Appendix C for a listing of mandatory elements identified in the Lifecycle Data Requirements Guide at the record
         group, series, file unit and item level, with Dublin Core equivalents.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because ARC will be used as the primary source for descriptive information about the holdings of permanent records at NARA,
         we refer readers to the LCDRG framework rather than discuss Encoded Archival Description (EAD) of finding aids. NARA has developed
         its own hierarchical descriptive structure that relates to Federal records in particular, and therefore has not implemented
         EAD locally. However, because of the prevalence of the use of EAD in the wider archival and digitization communities, we have
         included a reference here. For more information on EAD, see the official EAD site at the Library of Congress at <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/ead/">http://lcweb.loc.gov/ead/</a>; as well as the Research Library Group's Best Practices Guidelines for EAD at <a href="http://www.rlg.org/rlgead/eadguides.html">http://www.rlg.org/rlgead/eadguides.html</a>.

      <h4>Administrative -- </h4>
      
      <p>The Dublin Core set does not provide for administrative, technical, or highly structured metadata about different document
         types. Administrative metadata comprises both technical and preservation metadata, and is generally used for internal management
         of digital resources. Administrative metadata may include information about rights and reproduction or other access requirements,
         selection criteria or archiving policy for digital content, audit trails or logs created by a digital asset management system,
         persistent identifiers, methodology or documentation of the imaging process, or information about the source materials being
         scanned. In general, administrative metadata is informed by the local needs of the project or institution and is defined by
         project-specific workflows. Administrative metadata may also encompass repository-like information, such as billing information
         or contractual agreements for deposit of digitized resources into a repository.

      <h4>Rights -- </h4>
      
      <p>Although metadata regarding rights management information is briefly mentioned above, it encompasses an important piece of
         administrative metadata that deserves further discussion. Rights information plays a key role in the context of digital imaging
         projects and will become more and more prominent in the context of preservation repositories, as strategies to act upon digital
         resources in order to preserve them may involve changing their structure, format, and properties. Rights metadata will be
         used both by humans to identify rights holders and legal status of a resource, and also by systems that implement rights management
         functions in terms of access and usage restrictions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because rights management and copyright are complex legal topics, the General Counsel's office (or a lawyer) should be consulted
         for specific guidance and assistance. The following discussion is provided for informational purposes only and should not
         be considered specific legal advice.
      </p>
      
      <p>Generally, records created by employees of the Federal government as part of their routine duties, works for hire created
         under contract to the Federal government, and publications produced by the Federal government are all in
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-9-</i></p>
         
         the public domain. However, it is not enough to assume that if NARA has physical custody of a record that it also owns the
         intellectual property in that record. NARA also has custody of other records, where copyright may not be so straightforward
         -- such as personal letters written by private individuals, personal papers from private individuals, commercially published
         materials of all types, etc. -- which are subject to certain intellectual property and privacy rights and may require additional
         permissions from rights holders. After transfer or donation of records to NARA from other federal agencies or other entities,
         NARA may either: own both the physical record and the intellectual property in the record; own the physical record but not
         the intellectual property; or the record is in the public domain. It is important to establish who owns or controls both the
         physical record and the copyright at the beginning of an imaging project, as this affects reproduction, distribution, and
         access to digital images created from these records.
      </p>
      
      <p>Metadata element sets for intellectual property and rights information are still in development, but they will be much more
         detailed than statements that define reproduction and distribution policies. At a minimum, rights-related metadata should
         include: the legal status of the record; a statement on who owns the physical and intellectual aspects of the record; contact
         information for these rights holders; as well as any restrictions associated with the copying, use, and distribution of the
         record. To facilitate bringing digital copies into future repositories, it is desirable to collect appropriate rights management
         metadata at the time of creation of the digital copies. At the very least, digital versions should be identified with a designation
         of copyright status, such as: "public domain;" "copyrighted" (and whether clearance/permissions from rights holder has been
         secured); "unknown;" "donor agreement/contract;" etc.
      </p>
      
      <p>Preservation metadata dealing with rights management in the context of digital repositories will likely include detailed information
         on the types of actions that can be performed on data objects for preservation purposes and information on the agents or rights
         holders that authorize such actions or events.
      </p>
      
      <p>For an example of rights metadata in the context of libraries and archives, a rights extension schema has recently been added
         to the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), which documents metadata about the intellectual rights associated
         with a digital object.  This extension schema contains three components: a rights declaration statement; detailed information
         about rights holders; and context information, which is defined as "who has what permissions and constraints within a specific
         set of circumstances." The schema is available at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/rights/METSRights.xsd">http://www.loc.gov/standards/rights/METSRights.xsd</a>.

      <h4>Technical -- </h4>
      
      <p>Technical metadata refers to information that describes attributes of the digital image (not the analog source of the image)
         and helps to ensure that images will be rendered accurately. It supports content preservation by providing information needed
         by applications to use the file and to successfully control the transformation or migration of images across or between file
         formats. Technical metadata also describes the image capture process and technical environment, such as hardware and software
         used to scan images, as well as file format-specific information, image quality, and information about the source object being
         scanned, which may influence scanning decisions. Technical metadata helps to ensure consistency across a large number of files
         by enforcing standards for their creation. At a minimum, technical metadata should capture the information necessary to render,
         display, and use the resource.
      </p>
      
      <p>Technical metadata is characterized by information that is both objective and subjective  --  attributes of image quality
         that can be measured using objective tests as well as information that may be used in a subjective assessment of an image's
         value. Although tools for automatic creation and capture of many objective components
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-10-</i></p>
         
         are badly needed, it is important to determine what metadata should be highly structured and useful to machines, as opposed
         to what metadata would be better served in an unstructured, free-text note format. The more subjective data is intended to
         assist researchers in the analysis of digital resource or imaging specialists and preservation administrators in determining
         long-term value of a resource.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition to the digital image, technical metadata will also need to be supplied for the metadata record itself if the metadata
         is formatted as a text file or XML document or METS document, for example. In this sense, technical metadata is highly recursive,
         but necessary for keeping both images and metadata understandable over time.
      </p>
      
      <p>Requirements for technical metadata will differ for various media formats. For digital still images, we refer to the NISO
         Data Dictionary -- Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images at <a href="http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39_87_trial_use.pdf">http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39_87_trial_use.pdf</a>. It is a comprehensive technical metadata set based on the Tagged Image File Format specification, and makes use of the data
         that is already captured in file headers. It also contains metadata elements important to the management of image files that
         are not present in header information, but that could potentially be automated from scanner/camera software applications.
         An XML schema for the NISO technical metadata has been developed at the Library of Congress called MIX (Metadata in XML),
         which is available at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mix/">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mix/</a>.

      </p>
      
      <p>A new initiative led by the Research Libraries Group called <i>"Automatic Exposure: Capturing Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images"</i> is investigating ways to automate the capture of technical metadata specified in the NISO Z39.87 draft standard. The initiative
         seeks to build automated capture functionality into scanner and digital camera hardware and software in order to make this
         metadata readily available for transfer into repositories and digital asset management systems, as well as to make metadata
         capture more economically viable by reducing the amount of manual entry that is required. This implies a level of trust that
         the metadata that is automatically captured and internal to the file is inherently correct.
      </p>
      
      <p>See <a href="http://www.rlg.org/longterm/autotechmetadata.html">http://www.rlg.org/longterm/autotechmetadata.html</a> for further discussion of this initiative, as well as the discussion on Image Quality Assessment, below.
      </p>
      
      <p>Initiatives such as the Global Digital Format Registry (<a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/gdfr/">http://hul.harvard.edu/gdfr/</a>) could potentially help in reducing the number of metadata elements that need to be recorded about a file or group of files
         regarding file format information necessary for preservation functions. Information maintained in the Registry could be pointed
         to instead of recorded for each file or batch of files.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Structural -- </h4>
      
      <p>Structural metadata describes the relationships between different components of a digital resource. It ties the various parts
         of a digital resource together in order to make a useable, understandable whole. One of the primary functions of structural
         metadata is to enable display and navigation, usually via a page-turning application, by indicating the sequence of page images
         or the presence of multiple views of a multi-part item. In this sense, structural metadata is closely related to the intended
         behaviors of an object. Structural metadata is very much informed by how the images will be delivered to the user as well
         as how they will be stored in a repository system in terms of how relationships among objects are expressed.
      </p>
      
      <p>Structural metadata often describes the significant intellectual divisions of an item (such as chapter, issue, illustration,
         etc.) and correlates these divisions to specific image files. These explicitly labeled access points help to represent the
         organization of the original object in digital form. This does not imply, however, that the digital must always imitate the
         organization of the original -- especially for non-linear items, such as folded pamphlets. Structural metadata also associates
         different representations of the same resource together, such as production master files with their derivatives, or different
         sizes, views, or formats of the resource.
      </p>
      
      <p>Example structural metadata might include whether the resource is simple or complex (multi-page, multi-volume, has discrete
         parts, contains multiple views); what the major intellectual divisions of a resource are (table of contents, chapter, musical
         movement); identification of different views (double-page spread, cover, detail); the extent (in files, pages, or views) of
         a resource and the proper sequence of files, pages and views; as well as different technical (file formats, size), visual
         (pre- or post-conservation treatment), intellectual (part of a larger collection or work), and use (all instances of a resource
         in different formats -- 
         TIFF files for display, PDF files for printing, OCR file for full text searching) versions.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-11-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>File names and organization of files in system directories comprise structural metadata in its barest form. Since meaningful
         structural metadata can be embedded in file and directory names, consideration of where and how structural metadata is recorded
         should be done up front. See Section V. Storage for further discussion on this topic.
      </p>
      
      <p>No widely adopted standards for structural metadata exist since most implementations of structural metadata are at the local
         level and are very dependent on the object being scanned and the desired functionality in using the object. Most structural
         metadata is implemented in file naming schemes and/or in databases that record the order and hierarchy of the parts of an
         object so that they can be identified and reassembled back into their original form.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) is often discussed in the context of structural metadata, although
         it is inclusive of other types of metadata as well. METS provides a way to associate metadata with the digital files they
         describe and to encode the metadata and the files in a standardized manner, using XML. METS requires structural information
         about the location and organization of related digital files to be included in the METS document. Relationships between different
         representations of an object as well as relationships between different hierarchical parts of an object can be expressed.
         METS brings together a variety of metadata about an object all into one place by allowing the encoding of descriptive, administrative,
         and structural metadata. Metadata and content information can either be wrapped together within the METS document, or pointed
         to from the METS document if they exist in externally disparate systems. METS also supports extension schemas for descriptive
         and administrative metadata to accommodate a wide range of metadata implementations. Beyond associating metadata with digital
         files, METS can be used as a data transfer syntax so objects can easily be shared; as a Submission Information Package, an
         Archival Information Package, and a Dissemination Information Package in an OAIS-compliant repository (see below); and also
         as a driver for applications, such as a page turner, by associating certain behaviors with digital files so that they can
         be viewed, navigated, and used. Because METS is primarily concerned with structure, it works best with "library-like" objects
         in establishing relationships among multi-page or multi-part objects, but it does not apply as well to hierarchical relationships
         that exist in collections within an archival context.
      </p>
      
      <p>See <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/</a> for more information on METS.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Behavior -- </h4>
      
      <p>Behavior metadata is often referred to in the context of a METS object. It associates executable behaviors with content information
         that define how a resource should be utilized or presented. Specific behaviors might be associated with different genres of
         materials (books, photographs, Powerpoint presentations) as well as with different file formats. Behavior metadata contains
         a component that abstractly defines a set of behaviors associated with a resource as well as a "mechanism" component that
         points to executable code (software applications) that then performs a service according to the defined behavior. The ability
         to associate behaviors or services with digital resources is one of the attributes of a METS object and is also part of the
         "digital object architecture" of the Fedora digital repository system. See <a href="http://www.fedora.info/documents/master-spec-12.20.02.pdf">http://www.fedora.info/documents/master-spec-12.20.02.pdf</a> for a discussion of Fedora and digital object behaviors.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Preservation -- </h4>
      
      <p>Preservation metadata encompasses all information necessary to manage and preserve digital assets over time. Preservation
         metadata is usually defined in the context of the OAIS reference model (Open Archival Information System, <a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/overview.html">http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/nost/isoas/overview.html</a>), and is often linked to the functions and activities of a repository. It differs from technical metadata in that it documents
         processes performed over time (events or actions taken to preserve data and the outcomes of these events) as opposed to explicitly
         describing provenance (how a digital resource was created) or file format characteristics, but it does encompass all types
         of the metadata mentioned above, including rights information. Although preservation metadata draws on information recorded
         earlier (technical and structural metadata would be necessary to render and reassemble the resource into an understandable
         whole), it is most often associated with analysis of and actions performed on a resource after submission to a repository.
         Preservation metadata might include a record of changes to the resource, such as transformations or conversions from format
         to format, or indicate the nature of relationships among different resources.
      </p>
      
      <p>Preservation metadata is information that will assist in preservation decision-making regarding the long-term value of a digital
         resource and the cost of maintaining access to it, and will help to both facilitate archiving strategies for digital images
         as well as support and document these strategies over time. Preservation metadata is commonly linked with digital preservation
         strategies such as migration and emulation, as well as more "routine" system-level actions such as copying, backup, or other
         automated processes carried out on large numbers of objects. These strategies will rely on all types of pre-existing metadata
         and will also generate and record new
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-12-</i></p>
         
         metadata about the object. It is likely that this metadata will be both machine-processable and "human-readable" at different
         levels to support repository functions as well as preservation policy decisions related to these objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>In its close link to repository functionality, preservation metadata may reflect or even embody the policy decisions of a
         repository; but these are not necessarily the same policies that apply to preservation and reformatting in a traditional context.
         The extent of metadata recorded about a resource will likely have an impact on future preservation options to maintain it.
         Current implementations of preservation metadata are repository- or institution-specific. We anticipate that a digital asset
         management system may provide some basic starter functionality for low-level preservation metadata implementation, but not
         to the level of a repository modeled on the OAIS.

      <h4>Image quality assessment (NARA-NWTS Digital Imaging Lab proposed metadata requirement)-</h4>
      
      <p>The technical metadata specified in the <i>NISO Data Dictionary -- Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images</i> contains many metadata fields necessary for the long-term viability of the image file. However, we are not convinced that
         it goes far enough in providing information necessary to make informed preservation decisions regarding the value and quality
         of a digital still raster image. Judgments about the quality of an image require a visual inspection of the image, a process
         that cannot be automated. Quality is influenced by many factors -- such as the source material from which the image was scanned,
         the devices used to create the image, any subsequent processing done to the image, compression, and the overall intended use
         of the image. Although the data dictionary includes information regarding the analog source material and the scanning environment
         in which the image was created, we are uncertain whether this information is detailed enough to be of use to administrators,
         curators, and others who will need to make decisions regarding the value and potential use of digital still images. The value
         of metadata correlates directly with the future use of the metadata. It seems that most technical metadata specified in the
         NISO data dictionary is meant to be automatically captured from imaging devices and software and intended to be used by systems
         to render and process the file, not necessarily used by humans to make decisions regarding the value of the file. The metadata
         can make no guarantee about the quality of the data. Even if files appear to have a full complement of metadata and meet the
         recommended technical specifications as outlined in these <i>Technical Guidelines</i>, there may still be problems with the image file that cannot be assessed without some kind of visual inspection.
      </p>
      
      <p>The notion of an image quality assessment was partly inspired by the National Library of Medicine Permanence Ratings (see
         <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/reports/permanence.pdf">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/reports/permanence.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.rlg.org/events/pres-2000/byrnes.html">http://www.rlg.org/events/pres-2000/byrnes.html</a>), a rating for resource permanence or whether the content of a resource is anticipated to change over time. However, we focused
         instead on evaluating image quality and this led to the development of a simplified rating system that would: indicate a quality
         level for the suitability of the image as a production master file (its suitability for multiple uses or outputs), and serve
         as a potential metric that could be used in making preservation decisions about whether an image is worth maintaining over
         time. If multiple digital versions of a single record exist, then the image quality assessment rating may be helpful for deciding
         which version(s) to keep.
      </p>
      
      <p>The rating is linked to image defects introduced in the creation of intermediates and/or introduced during digitization and
         image processing, and to the nature and severity of the defects based on evaluating the digital
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-13-</i></p>
         
         images on-screen at different magnifications. In essence, a "good" rating for image files implies an appropriate level of
         image quality that warrants the effort to maintain them over time.
      </p>
      
      <p>The image quality assessment takes into account the attributes that influence specifications for scanning a production master
         image file: format, size, intended use, significant characteristics of the original that should be maintained in the scan,
         and the quality and characteristics of the source material being scanned. This rating system could later be expanded to take
         into account other qualities such as object completeness (are all pages or only parts of the resource scanned?); the source
         of the scan (created in-house or externally provided?); temporal inconsistencies (scanned at different times, scanned on different
         scanners, scan of object is pre- or post-conservation treatment?), and enhancements applied to the image for specific purposes
         (for exhibits, cosmetic changes among others).
      </p>
      
      <p>This rating is not meant to be a full technical assessment of the image, but rather an easy way to provide information that
         supplements existing metadata about the format, intent, and use of the image, all of which could help determine preservation
         services that could be guaranteed and associated risks based on the properties of the image. We anticipate a preservation
         assessment will to be carried out later in the object's lifecycle based on many factors, including the image quality assessment.
      </p>
      
      <p>Image quality rating metadata is meant to be captured at the time of scanning, during processing, and even at the time of
         ingest into a repository. When bringing batches or groups of multiple image files into a repository that do not have individual
         image quality assessment ratings, we recommend visually evaluating a random sample of images and applying the corresponding
         rating to all files in appropriate groups of files (such as all images produced on the same model scanner or all images for
         a specific project).
      </p>
      
      <p>Record whether the image quality assessment rating was applied as an individual rating or as a batch rating. If a batch rating,
         then record how the files were grouped.

      <p>As stated earlier, image quality assessment rating is applied to the digital image but is also linked to information regarding
         the source material from which it was scanned. Metadata about the image files includes a placeholder for information regarding
         source material, which includes a description of whether the analog source is the original or an intermediate, and if so,
         what kind of intermediate (copy, dupe, microfilm, photocopy, etc.) as well as the source format. Knowledge of deficiencies
         in the source material (beyond identifying the record type and format) helps to inform image quality assessment as well.
      </p>
      
      <p>The practicality of implementing this kind of assessment has not yet been tested, especially since it necessitates a review
         of images at the file level. Until this conceptual approach gains broader acceptance and consistent implementation within
         the community, quality assessment metadata may only be useful for local preservation decisions. As the assessment is inherently
         technical in nature, a basic foundation in photography and imaging is
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-15-</i></p>
         
         helpful in order to accurately evaluate technical aspects of the file, as well as to provide a degree of trustworthiness in
         the reviewer and in the rating that is applied.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Records management/recordkeeping -- </h4>
      
      <p>Another type of metadata, relevant to the digitization of federal records in particular, is records management metadata. Records
         management metadata is aligned with administrative-type metadata in that its function is to assist in the management of records
         over time; this information typically includes descriptive (and, more recently, preservation) metadata as a subset of the
         information necessary to both find and manage records. Records management metadata is usually discussed in the context of
         the systems or domains in which it is created and maintained, such as 
         Records Management Application (RMA) systems. This includes metadata about the records as well as the organizations, activities,
         and systems that create them. The most influential standard in the United States on records management metadata is the Department
         of Defense's Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications (DOD 5015.2) at <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/50152std.htm">http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/50152std.htm</a>. This standard focuses on minimum metadata elements a RMA should capture and maintain, defines a set of metadata elements
         at the file plan, folder, and record levels, and generally discusses the functionality that an RMA should have as well as
         the management, tracking, and integration of metadata that is held in RMAs.
      </p>
      
      <p>Records Management metadata should document whether digital images are designated as permanent records, new records, temporary
         records, reference copies, or are accorded a status such as "indefinite retention." A determination of the status of digital
         images in a records management context should be made front at the point of creation of the image, as this may have an effect
         on the level and detail of metadata that will be gathered for a digital object to maintain its significant properties and
         functionality over the long term. Official designation of the status of the digital images will be an important piece of metadata
         to have as digital assets are brought into a managed system, such as NARA's Electronic Records Archive (ERA), which will have
         extensive records management capabilities.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition to a permanent or temporary designation, records management metadata should also include documentation on any
         access and/or usage restrictions for the image files. Metadata documenting restrictions that apply to the images could become
         essential if both unrestricted and restricted materials and their metadata are stored and managed together in the same system,
         as these files will possess different maintenance, use and access requirements. Even if restricted files are stored on a physically
         separate system for security purposes, metadata about these files may not be segregated and should therefore include information
         on restrictions.
      </p>
      
      <p>For digitization projects done under NARA 816 guidance, we assume classified, privacy restricted, and any records with other
         restrictions will not be selected for digitization. However, records management metadata should still include documentation
         on access and usage restrictions -- even unrestricted records should be identified as "unrestricted." This may be important
         metadata to express at the system level as well, as controls over access to and use of digital resources might be built directly
         into a delivery or access system.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the future, documentation on access and use restrictions relevant to NARA holdings might include information such as: "classified"
         (which should be qualified by level of classification); "unclassified" or "unrestricted;" "declassified;" and "restricted,"
         (which should be qualified by a description of the restrictions, i.e., specific donor-imposed restrictions), for example.
         Classification designation will have an impact on factors such as physical storage (files may be physically or virtually stored
         separately), who has access to these resources, and different maintenance strategies.
      </p>
      
      <p>Basic records management metadata about the image files will facilitate bringing them into a formal system and will inform
         functions such as scheduling retention timeframes, how the files are managed within a system, what types or levels of preservation
         services can be performed, or how they are distributed and used by researchers, for example.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Tracking -- </h4>
      
      <p>Tracking metadata is used to control or facilitate the particular workflow of an imaging project during different stages of
         production. Elements might reflect the status of digital images as they go through different stages of the workflow (batch
         information and automation processes, capture, processing parameters, quality control, archiving, identification of where/media
         on which files are stored); this is primarily internally-defined metadata that serves as documentation of the project and
         may also serve also serve as a statistical source of information to track and report on progress of image files. Tracking
         metadata may exist in a database or via a directory/folder system.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-16-</i></p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Meta-metadata -- </h4>
      
      <p>Although this information is difficult to codify, it usually refers to metadata that describes the metadata record itself,
         rather than the object it is describing, or to high-level information about metadata "policy" and procedures, most often on
         the project level. Meta-metadata documents information such as who records the metadata, when and how it gets recorded, where
         it is located, what standards are followed, and who is responsible for modification of metadata and under what circumstances.
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that metadata files yield "master" records as well. These non-image assets are subject to the same
         rigor of quality control and storage as master image files. Provisions should be made for the appropriate storage and management
         of the metadata files over the long term.

         <h3>Assessment of Metadata Needs for Imaging Projects:</h3>

            <li><i>Does metadata already exist in other systems (database, finding aid, on item itself) or structured formats (Dublin Core, local
                  database)?</i> <br><br>If metadata already exists, can it be automatically derived from these systems, pointed to from new metadata gathered during
               scanning, or does it require manual input? Efforts to incorporate existing metadata should be pursued. It is also extremely
               beneficial if existing metadata in other systems can be exported to populate a production database prior to scanning. This
               can be used as base information needed in production tracking, or to link item level information collected at the time of
               scanning to metadata describing the content of the resource. An evaluation of the completeness and quality of existing metadata
               may need to be made to make it useful (e.g., what are the characteristics of the data content, how is it structured, can it
               be easily transformed?) <br><br>It is likely that different data sets with different functions will be developed, and these sets will exist in different systems.
               However, efforts to link together metadata in disparate systems should be made so that it can be reassembled into something
               like a METS document, an Archival XML file for preservation, or a Presentation XML file for display, depending on what is
               needed. Metadata about digital images should be integrated into peer systems that already contain metadata about both digital
               and analog materials. By their nature, digital collections should not be viewed as something separate from non-digital collections.
               Access should be promoted across existing systems rather than building a separate stand-alone system.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Who will capture metadata?</i> <br><br>Metadata is captured by systems or by humans and is intended for system or for human use. For example, certain preservation
               metadata might be generated by system-level activities such as data backup or copying. Certain technical metadata is used
               by applications to accurately render an image. In determining the function of metadata elements, it is important to establish
               whether this information is important for use by machines or by people. If it is information that is used and/or generated
               by systems, is it necessary to explicitly record it as metadata? What form of metadata is most useful for people? Most metadata
               element sets include less structured, note or comment-type fields that are intended for use by administrators and curators
               as data necessary for assessment of the provenance, risk of obsolescence, and value inherent to a particular class of objects.
               Any data, whether generated by systems or people, that is necessary to understand a digital object, should be considered as
               metadata that may be necessary to formally record. But because of the high costs of manually generating metadata and tracking
               system-level information, the use and function of metadata elements should be carefully considered. Although some metadata
               can be automatically captured, there is no guarantee that this data will be valuable over the long term.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>How will metadata be captured?</i> <br><br>Metadata capture will likely involve a mix of manual and automated entry. Descriptive and structural metadata creation is
               largely manual; some may be automatically generated through OCR processes to create indexes or fulltext; some technical metadata
               may be captured automatically from imaging software and devices; more sophisticated technical metadata, such as image quality
               assessment metadata used to inform preservation decisions, will require visual analysis and manual input. <br><br>An easy-to-use and customizable database or asset management system with a graphical and intuitive front end, preferably structured
               to mimic a project's particular metadata workflow, is desirable and will make for more efficient metadata creation.

            <li><i>When will metadata be collected?</i> <br><br>Metadata is usually collected incrementally during the scanning process and will likely be modified over time. At least, start
               with a minimal element set that is known to be needed and add additional elements later, if necessary. <br><br>Assignment of unique identifier or naming scheme should occur front. We also recommend that descriptive metadata be gathered
               prior to capture to help streamline the scanning process. It is usually much more difficult to add new metadata later on,
               without consultation of the originals. The unique file identifier can then be associated with a descriptive record identifier,
               if necessary. <br><br>A determination of what structural metadata elements to record should also occur prior to capture, preferably during the preparation
               of materials for capture or during collation of individual items. Information about the hierarchy of the collection, the object
               types, and the physical structure of the objects should be recorded in a production database prior to scanning. The structural
               parts of the object can be linked to actual content files during capture. Most technical metadata is gathered at the time
               of scanning. Preservation metadata is likely to be recorded later on, upon ingest into a repository.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Where will the metadata be stored? </i> <br><br>Metadata can be embedded within the resource (such as an image header or file name) or can reside in a system external to
               the resource (such as a database) or both. Metadata can be also encapsulated with the file itself, such as with the Metadata
               Encoded Transmission Standard (METS). The choice of location of metadata should encourage optimal functionality and long-term
               management of the data. <br><br>Header data consists of information necessary to decode the image, and has somewhat limited flexibility in terms of data values
               that can be put into the fields. Header information accommodates more technical than descriptive metadata (but richer sets
               of header data can be defined depending on the image file format). The advantage is that metadata remains with the file, which
               may result in more streamlined management of content and metadata over time. Several tags are saved automatically as part
               of the header during processing, such as dimensions, date, and color profile information, which can serve as base-level technical
               metadata requirements. However, methods for storing information in file format headers are very format-specific and data may
               be lost in conversions from one format to another. Also, not all applications may be able to read the data in headers. Information
               in headers should be manually checked to see if data has transferred correctly or has not been overwritten during processing.
               Just because data exists in headers does not guarantee that it has not been altered or has been used as intended. Information
               in headers should be evaluated to determine if it has value. Data from image headers can be extracted and imported into a
               database; a relationship between the metadata and the image must then be established and maintained. <br><br>Storing metadata externally to the image in a database provides more flexibility in managing, using, and transforming it and
               also supports multi-user access to the data, advanced indexing, sorting, filtering, and querying. It can better accommodate
               hierarchical descriptive information and structural information about multi-page or complex objects, as well as importing,
               exporting, and harvesting of data to external systems or other formats, such as XML. Because metadata records are resources
               that need to be managed in their own right, there is certainly benefit to maintaining metadata separately from file content
               in a managed system. Usually a unique identifier or the image file name is used to link metadata in an external system to
               image files in a directory. <br><br>We recommend that metadata be stored both in image headers as well as in an external database to facilitate migration and
               repurposing of the metadata. References between the metadata and the image files can be maintained via persistent identifiers.
               A procedure for synchronization of changes to metadata in both locations is also recommended, especially for any duplicated
               fields. This approach allows for metadata redundancy in different locations and at different levels of the digital object
               for ease of use (image file would not have to be accessed to get information; most header information would be extracted and
               added into an external system). Not all metadata should be duplicated in both places (internal and external to the file).
               Specific metadata is required in the header so that applications can interpret and render the file; additionally, minimal
               descriptive metadata such as a unique identifier or short description of the content of the file should be embedded in header
               information in case the file becomes disassociated from the tracking system or repository. Some applications and file formats
               offer a means to store metadata within the file in an intellectually structured manner, or allow the referencing of standardized
               schemes, such as Adobe XMP or the XML metadata boxes in the JPEG 2000 format. Otherwise, most metadata will reside in external
               databases, systems, or registries.

            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>How will the metadata be stored? </i> <br><br>Metadata schemes and data dictionaries define the content rules for metadata creation, but not the format in which metadata
               should be stored. Format may partially be determined by where the metadata is stored (file headers,

               relational databases, spreadsheets) as well as the intended use of the metadata  --  does it need to be human-readable, or
               indexed, searched, shared, and managed by machines? How the metadata is stored or encoded is usually a local decision. Metadata
               might be stored in a relational database or encoded in XML, such as in a METS document, for example. Guidelines for implementing
               Dublin Core in XML are also available at: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/09/09/dc-xml-guidelines/">http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/09/09/dc-xml-guidelines/</a>. <br><br>Adobe's Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is another emerging, standardized format for describing where metadata can be stored
               and how it can be encoded, thus facilitating exchange of metadata across applications. The XMP specification provides both
               a data model and a storage model. Metadata can be embedded in the file in header information or stored in XML "packets" (these
               describe how the metadata is embedded in the file). XMP supports the capture of (primarily technical) metadata during content
               creation and modification and embeds this information in the file, which can then be extracted later into a digital asset
               management system or database or as an XML file. If an application is XMP enabled or aware (most Adobe products are), this
               information can be retained across multiple applications and workflows. XMP supports customization of metadata to allow for
               local field implementation using their Custom File Info Panels application. XMP supports a number of internal schemas, such
               as Dublin Core and EXIF (a metadata standard used for image files, particularly by digital cameras), as well as a number of
               external extension schemas. The RLG initiative, <i>"Automatic Exposure: Capturing Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images," </i>mentioned earlier is considering the use of XMP to embed technical metadata in image files during capture and is developing
               a Custom File Info Panel for NISO Z39.87 technical metadata. XMP does not guarantee the automatic entry of all necessary metadata
               (several fields will still require manual entry, especially local fields), but allows for more complete customized, and accessible
               metadata about the file. <br><br>See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html">http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html</a> for more detailed information on the XMP specification and other related documents.

            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Will the metadata need to interact or be exchanged with other systems?</i> <br><br>This requirement reinforces the need for standardized ways of recording metadata so that it will meet the requirements of
               other systems. Mapping from an element in one scheme to an analogous element in another scheme will require that the meaning
               and structure of the data is shareable between the two schemes, in order to ensure usability of the converted metadata. Metadata
               will also have to be stored in or assembled into a document format, such as XML, that promotes easy exchange of data. METS-compliant
               digital objects, for example, promote interoperability by virtue of their standardized, "packaged" format.

            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>At what level of granularity will the metadata be recorded?</i> <br><br>Will metadata be collected at the collection level, the series level, the imaging project level, the item (object) level,
               or file level? Although the need for more precise description of digital resources exists so that they can be searched and
               identified, for many large-scale digitization projects, this is not realistic. Most collections at NARA are neither organized
               around nor described at the individual item level, and cannot be without significant investment of time and cost. Detailed
               description of records materials is often limited by the amount of information known about each item, which may require significant
               research into identification of subject matter of a photograph, for example, or even what generation of media format is selected
               for scanning. Metadata will likely be derived from and exist on a variety of levels, both logical and file, although not all
               levels will be relevant for all materials. Certain information required for preservation management of the files will be necessary
               at the individual file level. An element indicating level of aggregation (e.g., item, file, series, collection) at which metadata
               applies can be incorporated, or the relational design of the database may reflect the hierarchical structure of the materials
               being described.

            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Adherence to agreed-upon conventions and terminology?</i> <br><br>We recommend that standards, if they exist and apply, be followed for the use of data elements, data values, and data encoding.
               Attention should be paid to how data is entered into fields and whether controlled vocabularies have been used, in case transformation
               is necessary to normalize the data.

      <p>Because most of what we scan comes to the Imaging Lab on an item-by-item basis, we are capturing minimal descriptive and technical
         metadata at the item level only during the image capture and processing stage. Until a structure into which we can record
         hierarchical information both about the objects being scanned and their higher-level collection information is in place, we
         are entering basic metadata in files using Adobe Photoshop. Information about the file is added to the IPTC (International
         Press Telecommunications Council) fields in Photoshop in anticipation of mapping these values to an external database. The
         IPTC fields are used as placeholder fields only. This information is embedded in the file using Adobe XMP (Extensible Metadata

      <p>Structural metadata is currently embedded into the file name in a sequential numbering scheme for multi-part items and is
         reflected in working file directory structures. We anticipate that the file name, which follows the scheme: unique ID_scan
         year_component part_image role.format extension, can be parsed so that component parts of a digital resource can be logically
         related together. We also record minimal structural metadata in the header information, such as "front" and "back" for double-sided
         items or "cover," "page 1," "page 2," "double-page spread" etc. for multi-page items or multi-views. "Component part" is strictly
         a file sequence number and does not reflect actual page numbers. This metadata is currently recorded as text since the data
         is not intended to feed into any kind of display or navigation application at the moment.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Relationships -- </h4>
      
      <p>Currently there is no utility to record basic relationships among multi-page or multi-part image files beyond documenting
         relationships in file names. Until a digital asset management system is in place, our practice is to capture as much metadata
         as possible in the surrounding file structure (names, directories, headers). However, we consider that simple labels or names
         for file identifiers coupled with more sophisticated metadata describing relationships across files are the preferred way
         forward to link files together. This metadata would include file identifiers and metadata record identifiers and a codified
         or typed set of relationships that would help define the associations between image files and between different representations
         of the same resource. (Relationships between the digital object and the analog source object or the place of the digital object
         in a larger collection hierarchy would be documented elsewhere in descriptive metadata). Possible relationship types include
         identification of principal or authoritative version (for production master file); derivation relationships indicating what
         files come from what files; whether the images were created in the lab or come from another source; structural relationships
         (for multi-page or -part objects); sibling relationships (images of the same intellectual resource, but perhaps scanned from
         different source formats). We intend to further refine our work on relationships in the coming months, and start to define
         metadata that is specific to aggregations of files.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Batch level metadata -- </h4>
      
      <p>Currently, data common to all files produced in the Imaging Lab (such as byte order, file format, etc.) is not recorded at
         the logical level at this time, but we anticipate integrating this kind of information into the construction of a digital
         asset management system. We are continuing discussions on how to formalize "Lab common
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-21-</i></p>
         
         knowledge," such as details about the hardware and software configurations used to scan and process digital images, target
         information, and capture and image processing methodologies into our technical metadata specifications.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Permanent and temporary metadata -- </h4>
      
      <p>When planning for a digital imaging project, it may not be necessary to save all metadata created and used during the digitization
         phase of the project. For example, some tracking data may not be needed once all quality control and redo work has been completed.
         It may not be desirable, or necessary, to bring all metadata into a digital repository. For NARA's pilot Electronic Access
         Project, metadata fields that were calculated from other fields, such as square area of a document (used during the pre-scan
         planning phase to determine scanning resolution and size of access file derivatives), were not saved in the final database
         since they could be recalculated in the future. Also, it may not be desirable or necessary to provide access to all metadata
         that is maintained within a system to all users. Most administrative and technical metadata will need to be accessible to
         administrative users to facilitate managing the digital assets, but does not need to be made available to general users searching
         the digital collections.

         <h3>Raster Image Characteristics:</h3>
      </center>
      
      
      <h4>Spatial Resolution -- </h4>
      
      <p>Spatial resolution determines the amount of information in a raster image file in terms of the number of picture elements
         or pixels per unit measurement, but it does not define or guarantee the quality of the information. Spatial resolution defines
         how finely or widely spaced the individual pixels are from each other. The higher the spatial resolution the more finely spaced
         and the larger number of pixels overall. The lower the spatial resolution the more widely spaced the pixels and the fewer
         number of pixels overall.
      </p>
      
      <p>Spatial resolution is measured as pixels per inch or PPI, also pixels per millimeter or pixels per centimeter are used. Resolution
         is often referred to as dots per inch or DPI, in common usage the terms PPI and DPI are used interchangeably. Since raster
         image files are composed of pixels, technically PPI is a more accurate term and is used in this document (one example in support
         of using the PPI term is that Adobe Photoshop software uses the pixels per inch terminology). DPI is the appropriate term
         for describing printer resolution (actual dots vs. pixels); however, DPI is used often in scanning and image processing software
         to refer to spatial resolution and this usage is an understandable convention.
      </p>
      
      <p>The spatial resolution and the image dimensions determine the total number of pixels in the image; an 8"x10" photograph scanned
         at 100 ppi produces an image that has 800 pixels by 1000 pixels or a total of 800,000 pixels. The numbers of rows and columns
         of pixels, or the height and width of the image in pixels as described in the previous sentence, is known as the pixel array.
         When specifying a desired file size, it is always necessary to provide both the resolution and the image dimensions; ex. 300
         ppi at 8"x10" or even 300 ppi at original size.
      </p>
      
      <p>The image file size, in terms of data storage, is proportional to the spatial resolution (the higher the resolution, the larger
         the file size for a set document size) and to the size of the document being scanned (the larger the document, the larger
         the file size for a set spatial resolution). Increasing resolution increases the total number of pixels resulting in a larger
         image file. Scanning larger documents produces more pixels resulting in larger image files.
      </p>
      
      <p>Higher spatial resolution provides more pixels, and generally will render more fine detail of the original in the digital
         image, but not always. The actual rendition of fine detail is more dependent on the spatial frequency response of the scanner
         or digital camera (see Quantifying Scanner/Digital Camera Performance below), the image processing applied, and the characteristics
         of the item being scanned. Also, depending on the intended usage of the production master files, there may be a practical
         limit to how much fine detail is actually needed.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Signal Resolution -- </h4>
      
      <p>Bit-depth or signal resolution, sometimes called tonal resolution, defines the maximum number of shades and/or colors in a
         digital image file, but does not define or guarantee the quality of the information.
      </p>
      
      <p>In a 1-bit file each pixel is represented by a single binary digit (either a 0 or 1), so the pixel can be either black or
         white. There are only two possible combinations or 2<sup>1</sup> = 2.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-22-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The common standard for grayscale and color images is to use 8-bits (eight binary digits representing each pixel) of data
         per channel and this provides a maximum of 256 shades per channel ranging from black to white; 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 possible combinations of zeroes and ones.
      </p>
      
      <p>High-bit or 16-bits (16 binary digits representing each pixel) per channel images can have a greater number of shades compared
         to 8-bit per channel images, a maximum of over 65,000 shades vs. 256 shades; 2<sup>16</sup> -- 65,536 possible combinations of zeroes and ones.
      </p>
      
      <p>Well done 8-bits per channel imaging will meet most needs; with a limited ability for major corrections, transformations,
         and re-purposing because gross corrections of 8-bit per channel images may cause shades to drop out of the image, creating
         a posterization effect, due to the limited number of shades.
      </p>
      
      <p>High-bit images can match the effective shading and density range of photographic originals (assuming the scanner is actually
         able to capture the information), and, due to the greater shading (compared to 8-bits per channel), may be beneficial when
         re-purposing images and when working with images that need major or excessive adjustments to the tone distribution and/or
         color balance. However, at this time, monitors for viewing images and output devices for printing images all render high-bit
         images at 8-bits per pixel, so there is limited practical benefit to saving high-bit images and no way to verify the accuracy
         and quality of high-bit images. Also, it is best to do a good job during digitization to ensure accurate tone and color reproduction,
         rather than relying on post-scan correction of high-bit images. Poorly done high-bit imaging has no benefit.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Color Mode -- </h4>
      
      <p>Grayscale image files consist of a single channel, commonly either 8-bits (256 levels) or 16-bits (65,536 levels) per pixel
         with the tonal values ranging from black to white. Color images consist of three or more grayscale channels that represent
         color and brightness information, common color modes include RGB (red, green, blue), CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black),
         and LAB (lightness, red-green, blue-yellow). The channels in color files may be either 8 bits (256 levels) or 16-bits (65,536
         levels). Display and output devices mathematically combine the numeric values from the multiple channels to form full color
         pixels, ranging from black to white and to full colors.
      </p>
      
      <p>RGB represents an additive color process -- red, green and blue light are combined to form white light. This is the approach
         commonly used by computer monitors and televisions, film recorders that image onto photographic film, and digital printers/enlargers
         that print to photographic paper. RGB files have three color channels: 3 channels x 8 bits = 24-bit color file or 3 channels
         x 16-bits = 48-bit color. All scanners and digital cameras create RGB files, by sampling for each pixel the amount of light
         passing through red, green and blue filters that is reflected or transmitted by the item or scene being digitized. Black is
         represented by combined RGB levels of 0-0-0, and white is represented by combined RGB levels of 255-255-255. This is based
         on 8-bit imaging and 256 levels from 0 to 255; this convention is used for 16-bit imaging as well, despite the greater number
         of shades. All neutral colors have equal levels in all three color channels. A pure red color is represented by levels of
         255-0-0, pure green by 0-255-0, and pure blue by 0-0-255.
      </p>
      
      <p>CMYK files are an electronic representation of a subtractive process -- cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow (Y) are combined
         to form black. CMYK mode files are used for prepress work and include a fourth channel representing black ink (K). The subtractive
         color approach is used in printing presses (four color printing), color inkjet and laser printers (four color inks, many photo
         inkjet printers now have more colors), and almost all traditional color photographic processes (red, green and blue sensitive
         layers that form cyan, magenta and yellow dyes).
      </p>
      
      <p>LAB color mode is a device independent color space that is matched to human perception -- three channels representing lightness
         (L, equivalent to a grayscale version of the image), red and green information (A), and blue and yellow information (B). LAB
         mode benefits would include the matching to human perception and they do not require color profiles (see section on color
         management), disadvantages include the potential loss of information in the conversion from the RGB mode files from scanners
         and digital cameras, need to have high-bit data, and few applications and file formats support the mode.
      </p>
      
      <p>Avoid saving files in CMYK mode, CMYK files have a significantly reduced color gamut (see section on color management) and
         are not suitable for production master image files for digital imaging projects involving holdings/collections in cultural
         institutions. While theoretically LAB may have benefits, at this time we feel that RGB files produced to the color and tone
         reproduction described in these guidelines and saved with an Adobe RGB 1998 color profile are the most practical option for
         production master files and are relatively device independent. We acknowledge our workflow to produce RGB production master
         files may incur some level of loss of data, however we believe the benefits of using RGB files brought to a common rendering
         outweigh the minor loss.

         <h3>Digitization Environment:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Our recommendations and the ISO standards referred to below are based on using CRT monitors. Most LCD monitors we have tested
         do not compare in quality to the better CRTs in rendering fine detail and smooth gradients. Also, LCD monitors may have artifacts
         that make it difficult to distinguish image quality problems in the image files, and the appearance of colors and monitor
         brightness shift with the viewing angle of the LCD panel. This is changing rapidly and the image quality of current high-end
         LCD monitors is very close to the quality of better CRT monitors. If used, LCD monitors should meet the criteria specified
         below.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Viewing conditions -- </h4>
      
      <p>A variety of factors will affect the appearance of images, whether displayed or printed on reflective, transmissive or emissive
         devices or media. Those factors that can be quantified must be controlled to assure proper representation of an image.
      </p>
      
      <p>We recommend following the guidance in the following standards -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>ISO 3664 <i>Viewing Conditions -- For Graphic Technology and Photography </i> <br><br>Provides specifications governing viewing images on reflective and transmissive media, as well as images displayed on a computer
               monitor without direct comparison to any form of the originals.
            </li>
            
            <li>ISO 12646 <i>Graphic Technology -- Displays for Colour Proofing -- Characteristics and Viewing Conditions</i> (currently a draft international standard or DIS) <br><br>Provides specific requirements for monitors and their surrounds for direct comparison of images on a computer monitor with
               originals (known as soft proofing).
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p><b>NOTE</b> -- The following are common parameters controlled by users, however refer to the standards for complete requirements and
         test methods. In particular, ISO 12646 specifies additional hardware requirements for monitors to ensure a reasonable quality
         level necessary for comparison to hardcopy.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Monitor settings, light boxes, and viewing booths -- </h4>
      
      <p>We assume the assessment of many digital images will be made in comparison to the originals that have been digitized, therefore
         ISO 12646 should be followed where it supplements or differs from ISO 3664.
      </p>
      
      <p>We recommend digital images be viewed on a computer monitor set to 24 bits (millions of colors) or greater, and calibrated
         to a gamma of 2.2.
      </p>
      
      <p>ISO 12646 recommends the color temperature of the monitor also be set to 5000K (D50 illuminant) to match the white point of
         the illumination used for viewing the originals.
      </p>
      
      <p>Monitor luminance level must be at least 85 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, and should be 120 cd/m<sup>2</sup> or higher.
      </p>
      
      <p>The computer/monitor desktop should be set to a neutral gray background (avoid images, patterns, and/or strong colors), preferably
         no more than 10% of the maximum luminance of the screen.
      </p>
      
      <p>For viewing originals, we recommend using color correct light boxes or viewing booths that have a color temperature of 5000K
         (D50 illuminant), as specified in ISO 3664.
      </p>
      
      <p>ISO 3664 provides two luminance levels for viewing originals, ISO 12646 recommends using the lower levels (P2 and T2) when
         comparing to the image on screen.
      </p>
      
      <p>The actual illumination level on originals should be adjusted so the perceived brightness of white in the originals matches
         the brightness of white on the monitor.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>The room -- </h4>
      
      <p>The viewing environment should be painted/decorated a neutral, matte gray with a 60% reflectance or less to minimize flare
         and perceptual biases.
      </p>
      
      <p>Monitors should be positioned to avoid reflections and direct illumination on the screen.</p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-24-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>ISO 12646 requires the room illumination be less than 32 lux when measured anywhere between the monitor and the observer,
         and the light a color temperature of approximately 5000K.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Practical experience -- </h4>
      
      <p>In practice, we have found a tolerable range of deviation from the measurements required in the ISO standards. When the ambient
         room lighting is kept below the limit set in ISO 12646, its color temperature can be lower than 5000K, as long as it is less
         than the monitor color temperature.
      </p>
      
      <p>To compensate for environments that may not meet the ISO standards, as well as difficulties comparing analog originals to
         images on a monitor, the color temperature may need to be set higher than 5000K so that the range of grays from white to black
         appears neutral when viewed in the actual working environment. The higher color temperature may also be necessary for older
         monitors to reach an appropriate brightness, as long as neutrals don't appear too blue when compared to neutral hardcopy under
         the specified illumination.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Monitor calibration -- </h4>
      
      <p>In order to meet and maintain the monitor settings summarized above, we recommend using CRT monitors designed for the graphic
         arts, photography, or multimedia markets.
      </p>
      
      <p>A photosensor-based color calibrator and appropriate software (either bundled with the monitor or a third party application)
         should be used to calibrate the monitor to the aims discussed above. This is to ensure desired color temperature, luminance
         level, neutral color balance, and linearity of the red, green, and blue representation on the monitor are achieved.
      </p>
      
      <p>If using an ICC color managed workflow (see section on color management), an ICC profile should be created after monitor calibration
         for correct rendering of images.
      </p>
      
      <p>The monitor should be checked regularly and recalibrated when necessary.</p>
      
      <p>Using a photo sensor-based monitor calibrator, however, does not always ensure monitors are calibrated well. Ten years of
         practical experience has shown calibrators and calibration software may not work accurately or consistently. After calibration,
         it is important to assess the monitor visually, to make sure the monitor is adjusted appropriately. Assess overall contrast,
         brightness, and color neutrality of the gray desktop. Also, evaluate both color neutrality and detail rendering in white and
         black areas. This can be done using an image target of neutral patches ranging from black to white and saved in LAB color
         mode (since LAB does not require an ICC profile and can be viewed independently of the color managed process). In addition,
         it may be helpful to evaluate sample images or scans of targets -- such as the <i>NARA Monitor Adjustment Target</i> (shown below) and/or a known image such as a scan of a Kodak grayscale adjusted to the aimpoints (8-8-8/105-105-105/247-247-247)
         described below.

         <h3>Quantifying Scanner/Digital Camera Performance:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Much effort has gone into quantifying the performance of scanners and digital cameras in an objective manner. The following
         tests are used to check the capabilities of digitization equipment, and provide information on how to best use the equipment.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-25-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Even when digitization equipment is assessed as described below, it is still necessary to have knowledgeable and experienced
         staff to evaluate images visually. At this time, it is not possible to rely entirely on the objective test measurements to
         ensure optimum image quality. It is still necessary to have staff with the visual literacy and technical expertise to do a
         good job with digitization and to perform quality control for digital images. This is true for the digitization of all types
         of archival records, but very critical for the digitization of photographic images.
      </p>
      
      <p>Also, these tests are useful when evaluating and comparing scanners and digital cameras prior to purchase. Ask manufacturers
         and vendors for actual test results, rather than relying on the specifications provided in product literature, some performance
         claims in product literature are often overstated. If test results are not available, then try to scan test targets during
         a demonstration and consider having the analyses performed by a contract service.
      </p>
      
      <p>During digitization projects, tests should be performed on a routine basis to ensure scanners and digital cameras/copy systems
         are performing optimally. Again, if it is not possible to analyze the tests in-house, then consider having a service perform
         the analyses on the resulting image files.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following standards either are available or are in development, these test methods can be used for objective assessment
         of scanner or digital camera/copy system performance -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Terminology ISO 12231 </li>
            
            <li>Opto-electronic Conversion Function ISO 14524</li>
            
            <li>Resolution: Still Picture Cameras ISO 12233</li>
            
            <li>Resolution: Print Scanners ISO 16067-1</li>
            
            <li>Resolution: Film Scanners ISO 16067-2</li>
            
            <li>Noise: Still Picture Cameras ISO 15739</li>
            
            <li>Dynamic Range: Film Scanners ISO 21550</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>These standards can be purchased from ISO at <a href="http://www.iso.ch">http://www.iso.ch</a> or from IHS Global at <a href="http://global.ihs.com">http://global.ihs.com</a>. At this time, test methods and standards do not exist for all testing and device combinations. However, many tests are applicable
         across the range of capture device types and are cited in the existing standards as normative references.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other test methods may be used to quantify scanner/digital camera performance. We anticipate there will be additional standards
         and improved test methods developed by the group working on the above standards. Unfortunately, at this time image analysis
         software is expensive and complex making it difficult to perform all the tests needed to properly quantify scanner/digital
         camera performance. Also, there is a range of test targets needed for these tests and they can be expensive to purchase.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following requirements for performance criteria are based on measurements of the variety of actual scanners and digital
         cameras used in the NWTS Digital Imaging Lab. Where limits are specified, the limits are based on the performance of equipment
         we consider subjectively acceptable. This subjective acceptability is based on many years combined staff experience in the
         fields of photography, of photographic reformatting and duplication of a variety of archival records, and of digital imaging
         and digitization of a variety of archival records.
      </p>
      
      <p>No digitization equipment or system is perfect, they all have trade-offs in regards to image quality, speed, and cost. The
         engineering of scanners and digital cameras represents a compromise, and for many markets image quality is sacrificed for
         higher speed and lower cost of equipment. Many document and book scanners, office scanners (particularly inexpensive ones),
         and high-speed scanners (all types) may not meet the limits specified, particularly for properties like image noise. Also,
         many office and document scanners are set at the default to force the paper of the original document to pure white in the
         image, clipping all the texture and detail in the paper (not desirable for most originals in collections of cultural institutions).
         These scanners will not be able to meet the desired tone reproduction without recalibration (which may not be possible), without
         changing the scanner settings (which may not overcome the problem), or without modification of the scanner and/or software
         (not easily done).
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Test Frequency and Equipment Variability:</h4>
      
      <p>After equipment installation and familiarization with the hardware and software, an initial performance capability evaluation
         should be conducted to establish a baseline for each specific digitization device. At a minimum, this benchmark assessment
         would include for example -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>resolution performance for common sampling rates (e.g. 300, 400, 600, and 800 ppi for reflection scanning)</li>
            
            <li>OECF and noise characterization for different gamma settings</li>
            
            <li>lighting and image uniformity</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-26-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Many scanners can be used both with the software/device drivers provided by the manufacturer and with third-party software/device
         drivers, characterize the device using the specific software/device drivers to be used for production digitization. Also,
         performance can change dramatically (and not always for the better) when software/device drivers are updated, characterize
         the device after every update.
      </p>
      
      <p>A full suite of tests should be conducted to quantify the performance of digitization systems. Some tests probably only need
         to be redone on an infrequent basis, while others will need to be done on a routine basis. Depending on the performance consistency
         of equipment, consider performing tests using production settings on a weekly basis or for each batch of originals, whichever
         comes first. You may want to perform appropriate tests at the beginning of each batch and at the end of each batch to confirm
         digitization was consistent for the entire batch.
      </p>
      
      <p>Scanner/digital camera performance will vary based on actual operational settings. Tests can be used to optimize scanner/camera
         settings. The performance of individual scanners and digital cameras will vary over time (see test frequency above). Also,
         the performance of different units of the same model scanner/camera will vary. Test every individual scanner/camera with the
         specific software/device driver combination(s) used for production. Perform appropriate test(s) any time there is an indication
         of a problem. Compare these results to past performance through a cumulative database. If large variability is noted from
         one session to the next for given scanner/camera settings, attempt to rule out operator error first.

         <li>For reflection tests -- scan targets at a resolution of at least 50% increase from desired resolution (if you plan to save
            400 ppi files, then use at least 600 ppi for this test; 400 ppi x 1.5 = 600 ppi), test scans at 100% increase from desired
            resolution are preferable (if you plan to save 400 ppi, then use at least 800 ppi for testing; 400 ppi x 2 =800 ppi). Alternative
            -- scan targets at the maximum optical resolution cited by the manufacturer, be aware that depending on the scanner and given
            the size of the target, this can produce very large test files.

            areas of unevenness and the severity of unevenness -- 
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Scan the entire platen or copy board using typical settings for production work. For the reflection test -- scan a Kodak photographic
                  gray scale in the middle of the platen/copy board backed with an opaque sheet of white paper that covers the entire platen/copy
                  board; for scanners ensure good contact between the paper and the entire surface of the platen. For the transmission test
                  -- scan a Kodak black-and-white film step tablet in the middle of the platen and ensure the rest of the platen is clear. The
                  gray scale and step tablet are included in the scan to ensure auto ranging functions work properly. Scan the gray scale and
                  step tablet, each image should show the scale centered in an entirely white image.
               </li>
               
               <li>For image brightness variability -- Evaluate the images using the "Threshold" tool in Adobe Photoshop. Observe the histogram
                  in the Threshold dialog box and look for any clipping of the highlight tones of the image. Move the Threshold slider to higher
                  threshold values and observe when the first portion of the white background turns black and note the numeric level. Continue
                  adjusting the threshold higher until almost the entire image turns black (leaving small areas of white is OK) and note the
                  numeric level (if the highlights have been clipped the background will not turn entirely black even at the highest threshold
                  level of 255 -- if

                  this is the case, use 255 for the numeric value and note the clipping). Subtract the lower threshold value from the higher
                  threshold value. The difference represents the range of brightness levels of the areas of non-uniformity. With a perfectly
                  uniform image, the threshold would turn the entire image black within a range of only 1 to 2 levels. Observe the areas that
                  initially turn black as the threshold is adjusted, if possible avoid these areas of the platen/copy board when scanning. These
                  most frequently occur near the edge of the platen or field of view.
               </li>
               
               <li>For color variability -- Evaluate the images using the "Levels" tool in Adobe Photoshop. Move the white-point slider lower
                  while holding the Option (Macs)/Alternate (Windows) key to see the clipping point. Observe when the first pixels in the highlight
                  areas turn from black to any color and note the numeric level for the white-point. Continue shifting the white-point lower
                  until almost the entire image turns white (leaving small areas of black or color is OK) and note the numeric level. Subtract
                  the lower white-point value from the higher white-point value, the difference represents the range of color levels of the
                  areas of non-uniformity. With a perfectly uniform image the threshold would turn the entire image white within a range of
                  only 1 to 2 levels.

         <li>Guidance -- Make every effort to produce uniform images and to minimize variation. Avoid placing originals being scanned on
            areas of the platen/copy board that exhibit significant unevenness. Brightness and color variability ranges of 8 levels or
            less for RGB (3% or less for grayscale) are preferred. Achieving complete field uniformity may be difficult. Some scanners/digital
            cameras perform a normalization function to compensate for non-uniformity, many do not. It is possible, but very time consuming,
            to manually compensate for non-uniformity. Conceptually, this uses a low-resolution (50 ppi) grayscale image record of the
            uniformity performance along with the OECF conditions. In the future effective automated image processing functions may exist
            to compensate for unevenness in images, this should be done as part of the immediate post-capture image processing workflow.

                        film on a laser printer using the highest possible resolution setting of the printer (1,200 ppi minimum). Compare printed
                        scales to an accurate engineering ruler or tape measure to verify accuracy. Size the scales to match the originals being scanned,
                        shorter and smaller scales for smaller originals. Scan scales at the resolution to be used for originals.

                  application and printed on an accurate printer (tabloid or 11"x17" laser printer is preferred, but a good quality inkjet printer
                  can be used and will have to be for larger grids). Reflection grids should be printed on a heavy-weight, dimensionally stable,
                  opaque, white paper. Transmission grids should be printed onto overhead transparency film. Measure grid, both overall and
                  individual squares, with an accurate engineering ruler or tape measure to ensure it is accurate prior to using as a target.

         <h3>Reference Targets:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>We recommend including reference targets in each image of originals being scanned, including, at a minimum, a photographic
         gray scale as a tone and color reference and an accurate dimensional scale. If a target is included in each image, you may
         want to consider making access derivatives from the production masters that have the reference target(s) cropped out. This
         will reduce file size for the access files and present an uncluttered appearance to the images presented.
      </p>
      
      <p>In a high production environment, it may be more efficient to scan targets separately and do it once for each batch of originals.
         The one target per batch approach is acceptable as long as all settings and operation of the equipment remains consistent
         for the entire batch and any image processing is applied consistently to all the images. For scanners and digital cameras
         that have an "auto range" function, the single target per batch approach may not work because the tone and color settings
         will be vary due to the auto range function, depending on the density and color of each original.
      </p>
      
      <p>All targets should be positioned close to but clearly separated from the originals being scanned. There should be enough separation
         to allow easy cropping of the image of the original to remove the target(s) if desired, but not so much separation between
         the original and target(s) that it dramatically increases the file size. If it fits, orient the target(s) along the short
         dimension of originals, this will produce smaller file sizes compared to having the target(s) along the long dimension (for
         the same document, a more rectangular shaped image file is smaller than a squarer image). Smaller versions of targets can
         be created by cutting down the full-size targets. Do not make the tone and color targets so small that it is difficult to
         see and use the target during scanning (this is particularly important when viewing and working with low resolution image
         previews within scanning software).
      </p>
      
      <p>Make sure the illumination on the targets is uniform in comparison to the lighting of the item being scanned (avoid hot spots
         and/or shadows on the targets). Position targets to avoid reflections.
      </p>
      
      <p>If the originals are digitized under glass, place the tone and color reference targets under the glass as well. If originals
         are encapsulated or sleeved with polyester film, place the tone and color reference targets into a polyester sleeve.
      </p>
      
      <p>For digital copy photography set-ups using digital cameras, when digitizing items that have depth, it is important to make
         sure all reference targets are on the same level as the image plane -- for example, when digitizing a page in a thick book,
         make sure the reference targets are at the same height/level as the page being scanned.
      </p>
      
      <p>All types of tone and color targets will probably need to be replaced on a routine basis. As the targets are used they will
         accumulate dirt, scratches, and other surface marks that reduce their usability. It is best to replace the targets sooner,
         rather than using old targets for a longer period of time.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Scale and dimensional references -- </h4>
      
      <p>Use an accurate dimensional scale as a reference for the size of original documents.</p>
      
      <p>For reflection scanning, scales printed on photographic paper are very practical given the thinness of the paper and the dimensional
         accuracy that can be achieved during printing. Consider purchasing IEEE Std 167A-1995 facsimile test targets and using the
         ruler portion of the target along the left-hand edge. Due to the relatively small platen size of most scanners, you may need
         to trim the ruler off the rest of the target. Different length scales can be created to match the size of various originals.
         The Kodak Q-13 (8" long) or Q-14 (14" long) color bars have a ruler along the top edge and can be used as a dimensional reference;
         however, while these are commonly used, they are not very accurate.
      </p>
      
      <p>For transmission scanning, consider using thin, clear plastic drafting scales/rulers. If these are too thick, create a ruler
         in a drafting/drawing application (black lines only on a white background) and print the ruler onto overhead transparency
         film on a laser printer using the highest possible resolution setting of the printer (600 ppi minimum).Compare printed scales
         to an accurate engineering ruler or tape measure to verify accuracy prior to using as a target. Again, different length scales
         can be created to match the size of various originals.

      <h4>Targets for tone and color reproduction -- </h4>
      
      <p>Reference targets can be used to assist with adjusting scanners and image files to achieve objectively "good images" in terms
         of tone and color reproduction. This is particularly true with reflection scanning. Copy negatives and copy transparencies
         should be produced with targets, gray scales and color bars, so they can be printed or scanned to match the original. Unfortunately,
         scanning original negatives is much more subjective, and this is also the case for copy negatives and copy transparencies
         that do not contain targets.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Reflection scanning -- </h4>
      
      <p>We recommend including a Kodak Q-13 (8" long) or Q-14 (14" long) Gray Scale (20 steps, 0.10 density increments, and density
         range from approximately 0.05 to 1.95) within the area scanned. The Kodak gray scales are made of black-and-white photographic
         paper and have proven to work well as a reference target, including:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Good consistency from gray scale to gray scale</li>
            
            <li>Good color neutrality</li>
            
            <li>Reasonably high visual density of approximately 1.95</li>
            
            <li>Provide the ability to quantify color and tone for the full range of values from black-point up to white-point</li>
            
            <li>The spectral response of the photographic paper has been a reasonable match for a wide variety of originals being scanned
               on a wide variety of scanners/digital cameras, few problems with metamerism
            </li>
            
            <li>The semi-matte surface tends to minimize problems with reflections and is less susceptible to scratching</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>The Kodak Color Control Patches (commonly referred to as color bars) from the Q-13 and Q-14 should only be used as a supplement
         to the gray scale, and never as the only target. The color bars are produced on a printing press and are not consistent. Also,
         the color bars do not provide the ability to assess color and tone reproduction for the full range of values from black-point
         to white-point.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other gray scales produced on black-and-white photographic papers could be used. However, many have a glossy surface that
         will tend to scratch easily and cause more problems with reflections. Also, while being monochrome, some gray scales are not
         neutral enough to be used as a target.
      </p>
      
      <p>IT8 color input targets (ex. Kodak Q-60) should not be used as scanning reference targets. IT8 targets are used for producing
         custom color profiles for scanning specific photographic papers, and therefore are produced on modern color photographic paper.
         Often, the neutral patches on IT8 targets are not neutral and the spectral response of the color photographic paper is not
         likely to match the response of most materials being scanned, therefore IT8 targets will not work well as a scanning reference.
         Also, there is little consistency from one IT8 target to another, even when printed on the same color photo paper.
      </p>
      
      <p>Consider using a calibrated densitometer or colorimeter to measure the actual visual density or L*A*B* values of each step
         of the gray scales used as reference targets. Then use a laser printer to print the actual densities and/or L*A*B* values
         (small font, white text on a gray background) and tape the information above the gray scale so the corresponding values are
         above each step; for the Kodak gray scales you may need to reprint the identifying numbers and letters for each step. This
         provides a quick visual reference within the digital image to the actual densities.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Transmission scanning -- positives -- </h4>
      
      <p>Generally, when scanning transmissive positives, like original color transparencies and color slides, a tone and color reference
         target is usually not necessary. Most scanners are reasonably well calibrated for scanning color transparencies and slides
         (usually they are not so well calibrated for scanning negatives).
      </p>
      
      <p>Transparencies and slides have the highest density range of photographic materials routinely scanned. You may need to include
         within the scan area both a maximum density area of the transparency (typically an unexposed border) and a portion of empty
         platen to ensure proper auto ranging. Mounted slides can present problems, it is easy to include a portion of the mount as
         a maximum density area, but since it may not be easy to include a clear area in the scan, you should check highlight levels
         in the digital image to ensure no detail was clipped.
      </p>
      
      <p>Ideally, copy transparencies and slides were produced with a gray scale and color bars in the image along with the original.
         The gray scale in the image should be used for making tone and color adjustments. Caution, carefully evaluate using the gray
         scales in copy transparencies and slides to make sure that the illumination was even, there are no reflections on the gray
         scale, and the film was properly processed with no color cross-overs (the highlights and shadows have very different color
         casts). If any problems exist, you may have problems using the gray scale in the image, as tone and color adjustments will
         have to be done without relying on the gray scale.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-31-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>For the best results with transmission scanning, it is necessary to control extraneous light known as flare. It may be necessary
         to mask the scanner platen or light box down to the just the area of the item being scanned or digitized.
      </p>
      
      <p>Generally, photographic step tablets on black-and-white film (see discussion on scanning negatives below) are not good as
         tone and color reference targets for color scanning.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Transmission scanning -- negatives -- </h4>
      
      <p>We recommend including an uncalibrated Kodak Photographic Step Tablet (21 steps, 0.15 density increments, and density range
         of approximately 0.05 to 3.05), No. 2 (5" long) or No. 3 (10" long), within the scan area. The standard density range of a
         step tablet exceeds the density range of most originals that would be scanned, and the scanner can auto-range on the step
         tablet minimizing loss of detail in the highlight and/or shadow areas of the image.
      </p>
      
      <p>For production masters, we recommend the brightness range be optimized or matched to the density range of the originals. It
         may be necessary to have several step tablets, each with a different density range to approximately match the density range
         of the items being scanned; it is preferable the density range of the step tablet just exceeds the density range of the original.
         These adjusted step tablets can be produced by cutting off the higher density steps of standard step tablets. If originals
         have a very short or limited density range compared to the reference targets, this may result in quantization errors or unwanted
         posterization effects when the brightness range of the digital image is adjusted; this is particularly true for images from
         low-bit or 8-bit per channel scanners compared to high-bit scanners/cameras.
      </p>
      
      <p>Ideally, copy negatives were produced with a gray scale and/or color bars in the image along with the original. The gray scale
         in the image should be used for making tone and/or color adjustments. Caution, carefully evaluate using the gray scales in
         copy negatives to make sure that the illumination was even, there are no reflections on the gray scale, and for color film
         the film was properly processed with no color cross-overs (the highlights and shadows have very different color casts). If
         any problems exist with the quality of the copy negatives, you may have problems using the gray scale in the image, as tone
         and/or color adjustments will have to be done without relying on the gray scale.
      </p>
      
      <p>For the best results with transmission scanning, it is necessary to control extraneous light known as flare. It may be necessary
         to mask the scanner platen or light box down to the just the area of the item being scanned or digitized. This is also true
         for step tablets being scanned as reference targets. Also, due to the progressive nature of the step tablet, with the densities
         increasing along the length, it may be desirable to cut the step tablet into shorter sections and mount them out of sequence
         in an opaque mask; this will minimize flare from the low density areas influencing the high density areas.
      </p>
      
      <p>Consider using a calibrated densitometer to measure the actual visual and color density of each step of the step tablets used
         as reference targets. Use a laser printer to print the density values as gray letters against a black background and print
         onto overhead transparency film, size and space the characters to fit adjacent to the step tablet. Consider mounting the step
         tablet (or a smaller portion of the step tablet) into an opaque mask with the printed density values aligned with the corresponding
         steps. This provides a quick visual reference within the digital image to the actual densities.

      <center>
         <h3>Adjusting Image Files:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>There is a common misconception that image files saved directly from a scanner or digital camera are pristine or unmolested
         in terms of the image processing. For almost all image files this is simply untrue. Only "raw" files from scanners or digital
         cameras are unadjusted, all other digital image files have a range of image processing applied during scanning and prior to
         saving in order to produce digital images with good image quality.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because of this misconception, many people argue you should not perform any post-scan or post-capture adjustments on image
         files because the image quality might be degraded. We disagree. The only time we would recommend saving unadjusted files is
         if they meet the exact tone and color reproduction, sharpness, and other image quality parameters that you require. Otherwise,
         we recommend doing minor post-scan adjustment to optimize image quality and bring all images to a common rendition. Adjusting
         production master files to a common rendition provides significant benefits in terms of being able to batch process and treat
         all images in the same manner. Well designed and calibrated scanners and digital cameras can produce image files that require
         little
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-32-</i></p>
         
         or no adjustment, however, based on our practical experience, there are very few scanners/cameras that are this well designed
         and calibrated.
      </p>
      
      <p>Also, some people suggest it is best to save raw image files, because no "bad" image processing has been applied. This assumes
         you can do a better job adjusting for the deficiencies of a scanner or digital camera than the manufacturer, and that you
         have a lot of time to adjust each image. Raw image files will not look good on screen, nor will they match the appearance
         of originals. Raw image files cannot be used easily; this is true for inaccurate unadjusted files as well. Every image, or
         batch of images, will have to be evaluated and adjusted individually. This level of effort will be significant, making both
         raw files and inaccurate unadjusted files inappropriate for production master files.
      </p>
      
      <p>We believe the benefits of adjusting images to produce the most accurate visual representation of the original outweigh the
         insignificant data loss (when processed appropriately), and this avoids leaving images in a raw unedited state. If an unadjusted/raw
         scan is saved, future image processing can be hindered by unavailability of the original for comparison. If more than one
         version is saved (unadjusted/raw and adjusted), storage costs may be prohibitive for some organizations, and additional metadata
         elements would be needed. In the future, unadjusted or raw images will need to be processed to be used and to achieve an accurate
         representation of the originals and this will be difficult to do.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Overview:</h4>
      
      <p>We recommend using the scanner/camera controls to produce the most accurate digital images possible for a specific scanner
         or digital camera. Minor post-scan/post-capture adjustments are acceptable using an appropriate image processing workflow
         that will not significantly degrade image quality.
      </p>
      
      <p>We feel the following goals and tools are listed in priority order of importance
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>. 1. Accurate imaging -- use scanner controls and reference targets to create grayscale and color images that are:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>i. Reasonably accurate in terms of tone and color reproduction, if possible without relying on color management.</li>
                  
                  <li>ii. Consistent in terms of tone and color reproduction, both image to image consistency and batch to batch consistency.</li>
                  
                  <li>iii. Reasonably matched to an appropriate use-neutral common rendering for all images.</li>
                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>2. Color management -- as a supplement to accurate imaging, use color management to compensate for differences between devices
               and color spaces:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>i. If needed to achieve best accuracy in terms of tone, color, and saturation -- use custom profiles for capture devices and
                     convert images to a common wide-gamut color space to be used as the working space for final image adjustment.
                  </li>
                  
                  <li>ii. Color transformation can be performed at time of digitization or as a post scan/digitization adjustment.</li>
                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>3. Post scan/digitization adjustment -- use appropriate image processing tools to:
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>i. Achieve final color balance and eliminate color biases (color images).</li>
                  
                  <li>ii. Achieve desired tone distribution (grayscale and color images).</li>
                  
                  <li>iii. Sharpen images to match appearance of the originals, compensate for variations in originals and the digitization process
                     (grayscale and color images).
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>The following sections address various types of image adjustments that we feel are often needed and are appropriate. The amount
         of adjustment needed to bring images to a common rendition will vary depending on the original, on the scanner/digital camera
         used, and on the image processing applied during digitization (the specific scanner or camera settings).

         <h3>Scanning aimpoints -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>One approach for ensuring accurate tone reproduction (the appropriate distribution of the tones) for digital images is to
         place selected densities on a gray scale reference target at specific digital levels or aimpoints. Also, for color images
         it is possible to improve overall color accuracy of the image by neutralizing or eliminating color biases of the same steps
         of the gray scale used for the tone reproduction aimpoints.
      </p>
      
      <p>This approach is based on working in a gray-balanced color space, independent of whether it is an ICC color managed workflow
         or not.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-33-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>In a digital image, the white point is the lightest spot (highest RGB levels for color files and lowest % black for grayscale
         files) within the image, the black point is the darkest spot (lowest RGB levels for color files and highest % black for grayscale
         files), and a mid-point refers to a spot with RGB levels or % black in the middle of the range.
      </p>
      
      <p>Generally, but not always, the three aimpoints correspond to the white-point, a mid-point, and the black-point within a digital
         image, and they correspond to the lightest patch, a mid-density patch, and the darkest patch on the reference gray scale within
         the digital image. This assumes the photographic gray scale has a larger density range than the original being scanned. In
         addition to adjusting the distribution of the tones, the three aimpoints can be used for a three point neutralization of the
         image to eliminate color biases in the white-point, a mid-point, and the black-point.
      </p>
      
      <p>The aimpoints cited in this section are guidelines only. Often it is necessary to vary from the guidelines and use different
         values to prevent clipping of image detail or to provide accurate tone and color reproduction.
      </p>
      
      <p><img src="images/hatstepsinitialtext.jpg"></p>
      
      <p>Since the aimpoints rely on a photographic gray scale target, they are only applicable when a gray scale is used as a reference.
         If no gray scale is available (either scanned with the original or in a copy transparency/negative), the Kodak Color Control
         Patches (color bars) can be used and alternative aimpoints for the color bars are provided. We recommend using a photographic
         gray scale and not relying on the color bars as the sole target.
      </p>
      
      <p>Many image processing applications have automatic and manual "place white-point" and "place black-point" controls that adjust
         the selected areas to be the lightest and darkest portions of the image, and that will neutralize the color in these areas
         as well as. Also, most have a "neutralize mid-point" control, but usually the tonal adjustment for brightness has to be done
         separately with a "curves", "levels", "tone curve", etc, control. The better applications will let you set the specific RGB
         or % black levels for the default operation of the place white-point, place black-point, and neutralize mid-point controls.
      </p>
      
      <p>Typically, both the brightness placement (for tone reproduction) and color neutralization to adjust the color balance (for
         color reproduction) should be done in the scanning step and/or as a post-scan adjustment using image processing software.
         A typical manual workflow in Adobe Photoshop is black-point placement and neutralization
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-34-</i></p>
         
         (done as a single step, control set to desired neutral level prior to use), white-point placement and neutralization (done
         as a single step, control set to desired neutral level prior to use), mid-point neutralization (control set to neutral value
         prior to use), and a gamma correction to adjust the brightness of the mid point (using levels or curves). For grayscale images
         the mid-point neutralization step is not needed. The tools in scanner software and other image processing software should
         allow for a similar approach, the sequence of steps may need to be varied to achieve best results.
      </p>
      
      <p>The three point tone adjustment and color neutralization approach does not guarantee accurate tone and color reproduction.
         It works best with most scanners with reflection scanning, but it can be difficult to achieve good tone and color balance
         when scanning copy negatives/transparencies. It can be very difficult to produce an accurate digital image reproduction from
         color copy negatives/transparencies that exhibit color cross-over or other defects such as under/over exposure or a strong
         color cast. The three point neutralization approach will help minimize these biases, but may not eliminate the problems entirely.
      </p>
      
      <p>If the overall color balance of an image is accurate, using the three point neutralization to adjust the color reproduction
         may cause the color balance of the shades lighter and darker than the mid-point to shift away from being neutral. For accurate
         color images that need to have just the tone distribution adjusted, apply levels or curves adjustments to the luminosity information
         only, otherwise the overall color balance is likely to shift.
      </p>
      
      <p>When scanning photographic prints it is important to be careful about placing the black point, in some cases the print being
         scanned will have a higher density than the darkest step of the photographic gray scale. In these cases, you should use a
         lighter aimpoint for the darkest step of the gray scale so the darkest portion of the image area is placed at the normal aimpoint
         value (for RGB scans, the shadow area on the print may not be neutral in color and the darkest channel should be placed at
         the normal aimpoint).
      </p>
      
      <p>Occasionally, objects being scanned may have a lighter value than the lightest step of the photographic gray scale, usually
         very bright modern office papers or modern photo papers with a bright-white base. In these cases, you should use a darker
         aimpoint for the lightest step of the gray scale so the lightest portion of the image area is placed at the normal aimpoint
         value (for RGB scans, the lightest area of the object being scanned may not be neutral in color and the lightest channel should
         be placed at the normal aimpoint).
      </p>
      
      <p>Aimpoints may need to be altered not only for original highlight or shadow values outside the range of the grayscale, but
         also deficiencies in lighting, especially when scanning photographic intermediates. Excessive flare, reflections, or uneven
         lighting may need to be accounted for by selecting an alternate value for a patch, or selecting a different patch altogether.
         At no point should any of the values in any of the color channels of the properly illuminated original fall outside the minimum
         or maximum values indicated below for scanning without a grayscale.
      </p>
      
      <p>The aimpoints recommended in the 1998 NARA guidelines have proven to be appropriate for monitor display and for printed output
         on a variety of printers. The following table provides slightly modified aimpoints to minimize potential problems when printing
         the image files; the aimpoints described below create a slightly compressed tonal scale compared to the aimpoints in the 1998
         guidelines.
      </p>
      
      <p>All aimpoint measurements and adjustments should be made using either a 5x5 pixel (25 pixels total) or 3x3 pixel (9 pixels
         total) sample. Avoid using a point-sample or single pixel measurement.

      <h4>Aimpoint variability -- </h4>
      
      <p>For the three points that have been neutralized and placed at the aimpoint values: no more than +/- 3 RGB level variance from
         aimpoints and no more than 3 RGB level difference in the individual channels within a patch for RGB scanning and no more than
         +/- 1% level variance from the aimpoints in % black for grayscale scanning. Again, the image sampler (in Adobe Photoshop or
         other image processing software) should be set to measure an average of either 5x5 pixels or 3x3 pixels when making these
         measurements, point sample or single pixel measurements should not be used.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other steps on the gray scale may, and often will, exhibit a higher degree of variation. Scanner calibration, approaches to
         scanning/image processing workflow, color management, and variation in the target itself can all influence the variability
         of the other steps and should be used/configured to minimize the variability for the other steps of the gray scale. Usually
         the other steps of the gray scale will be relatively consistent for reflection scanning, and significantly less consistent
         when scanning copy negatives and copy transparencies.
      </p>

            <li>For RGB scanning the highlight not to go above RGB levels of 247-247-247 and shadow not to go below RGB levels of 8-8-8.</li>

         <h3>Color Management Background:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Digitization is the conversion of analog color and brightness values to discrete numeric values. A number, or set of numbers,
         designates the color and brightness of each pixel in a raster image. The rendering of these numerical
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-37-</i></p>
         
         values, however, is very dependent on the device used for capture, display or printing. Color management provides a context
         for objective interpretation of these numeric values, and helps to compensate for differences between devices in their ability
         to render or display these values, within the many limitations inherent in the reproduction of color and tone.
      </p>
      
      <p>Color management does not guarantee the accuracy of tone and color reproduction. We recommend color management not be used
         to compensate for poor imaging and/or improper device calibration. As described above, it is most suitable to correct for
         color rendering differences from device to device.
      </p>
      
      <p>Every effort should be made to calibrate imaging devices and to adjust scanner/digital camera controls to produce the most
         accurate images possible in regard to tone and color reproduction (there are techniques for rescuing poorly captured images
         that make use of profile selection, particularly synthesized profiles, that will not be discussed here. For further information
         see the writings of Dan Margulis and Michael Kieran). Calibration will not only improve accuracy of capture, but will also
         ensure the consistency required for color management systems to function by bringing a device to a stable, optimal state.
         Methods for calibrating hardware vary from device to device, and are beyond the scope of this guidance.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>International Color Consortium (ICC) color management system -- </h4>
      
      <p>Currently, ICC-based color management is the most widely implemented approach. It consists of four components that are integrated
         into software (both the operating system and applications):
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>PCS (Profile Connection Space)
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>Typically, end users have little direct interaction with the PCS; it is one of two device-independent measuring systems for
                     describing color based on human vision and is usually determined automatically by the source profile. The PCS will not be
                     discussed further.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Profile
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>A profile defines how the numeric values that describe the pixels in images are to be interpreted, by describing the behavior
                     of a device or the shape and size of a color space.
                  </li>
                  
               </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>Rendering intent
               
               <ul>
                  
                  <li>Rendering intents determine how out-of-gamut colors will be treated in color space transformations.</li>

      <h4>Profiles -- </h4>
      
      <p>Profiles are sets of numbers, either a matrix or look up table (LUT), that describe a color space (the continuous spectrum
         of colors within the gamut, or outer limits, of the colors available to a device) by relating color descriptions specific
         to that color space to a PCS.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although files can be saved with any ICC-compliant profile that describes an input device, output device or color space (or
         with no profile at all), it is best practice to adjust the color and tone of an image to achieve an accurate rendition of
         the original in a common, well-described, standard color space. This minimizes future effort needed to transform collections
         of images, as well as streamlines the workflow for repurposing images by promoting consistency. Although there may be working
         spaces that match more efficiently with the gamut of a particular original, maintaining a single universal working space that
         covers most input and output devices has additional benefits. Should the profile tag be lost from an image or set of images,
         the proper profile can be correctly assumed within the digitizing organization, and outside the digitizing organization it
         can be reasonably found through trial and error testing of the small set of standard workspaces.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some have argued saving unedited image files in the input device space (profile of the capture device) provides the least
         compromised data and allows a wide range of processing options in the future, but these files may not be immediately usable
         and may require individual or small batch transformations. The data available from the scanner has often undergone some amount
         of adjusting beyond the operator's control, and may not be the best representation of the original. We recommend the creation
         of production master image files using a standard color space that will be accurate in terms of color and tone reproduction
         when compared to the original.
      </p>
      
      <p>The RGB color space for production master files should be gray-balanced, perceptually uniform, and sufficiently large to encompass
         most input and output devices, while not wasting bits on unnecessary color descriptions. Color spaces that describe neutral
         gray with equal amounts of red, green and blue are considered to be gray-balanced. A gamma of 2.2 is considered perceptually
         uniform because it approximates the human visual response to stimuli.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-38-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The Adobe RGB 1998 color space profile adequately meets these criteria and is recommended for storing RGB image files. Adobe
         RGB 1998 has a reasonably large color gamut, sufficient for most purposes when saving files as 24-bit RGB files (low-bit files
         or 8-bits per channel). Using larger gamut color spaces with low-bit files can cause quantization errors, therefore wide gamut
         color spaces are more appropriate when saving high-bit or 48-bit RGB files. Gray Gamma 2.2 (available in Adobe products) is
         recommended for grayscale images.
      </p>
      
      <p>An ideal workflow would be to scan originals with a calibrated and characterized device, assign the profile of that device
         to the image file, and convert the file to the chosen workspace (Adobe RGB 1998 for color or Gray Gamma 2.2 for grayscale).
         Not all hardware and software combinations produce the same color and tonal conversion, and even this workflow will not always
         produce the best results possible for a particular device or original. Different scanning, image processing and printing applications
         have their own interpretation of the ICC color management system, and have varying controls that produce different levels
         of quality. It may be necessary to deviate from the normal, simple color managed workflow to achieve the best results. There
         are many options possible to achieve the desired results, many of which are not discussed here because they depend on the
         hardware and software available.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Rendering intents -- </h4>
      
      <p>When converting images from one color space to another, one of four rendering intents must be designated to indicate how the
         mismatch of size and shape of source and destination color spaces is to be resolved during color transformations -- perceptual,
         saturation, relative colorimetric, or absolute colorimetric. Of the four, perceptual and relative colorimetric intents are
         most appropriate for creation of production master files and their derivatives. In general, we have found that perceptual
         intent works best for photographic images, while relative colorimetric works best for images of text documents and graphic
         originals. It may be necessary to try both rendering intents to determine which will work best for a specific image or group
         of images.
      </p>
      
      <p>When perceptual intent is selected during a color transformation, the visual relationships between colors are maintained in
         a manner that looks natural, but the appearance of specific colors are not necessarily maintained. As an example, when printing,
         the software will adjust all colors described by the source color space to fit within a smaller destination space (printing
         spaces are smaller than most source or working spaces). For images with significant colors that are out of the gamut of the
         destination space (usually highly saturated colors), perceptual rendering intent often works best.
      </p>
      
      <p>Relative colorimetric intent attempts to maintain the appearance of all colors that fall within the destination space, and
         to adjust out-of-gamut colors to close, in-gamut replacements. In contrast to absolute colorimetric, relative colorimetric
         intent includes a comparison of the white points of the source and destination spaces and shifts all colors accordingly to
         match the brightness ranges while maintaining the color appearance of all in-gamut colors. This can minimize the loss of detail
         that may occur with absolute colorimetric in saturated colors if two different colors are mapped to the same location in the
         destination space. For images that do not contain significant out of gamut colors (such as near-neutral images of historic
         paper documents), relative colorimetric intent usually works best.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Color Management Modules -- </h4>
      
      <p>The CMM uses the source and destination profiles and the rendering intent to transform individual color descriptions between
         color spaces. There are several CMMs from which to select, and each can interact differently with profiles generated from
         different manufacturers' software packages. Because profiles cannot provide an individual translation between every possible
         color, the CMM interpolates values using algorithms determined by the CMM manufacturer and each will give varying results.
      </p>
      
      <p>Profiles can contain a preference for the CMM to be used by default. Some operating systems allow users to designate a CMM
         to be used for all color transformations that will override the profile tag. Both methods can be superceded by choosing a
         CMM in the image processing application at the time of conversion. We recommend that you choose a CMM that produces acceptable
         results for project-specific imaging requirements, and switch only when unexpected transformations occur.

         <h3>Image Processing:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>After capture and transformation into one of the recommended color spaces (referred to as a "working space" at this point
         in the digitization process), most images require at least some image processing to produce the best digital rendition of
         the original. The most significant adjustments are color correction, tonal adjustment and sharpening. These processes involve
         data loss and should be undertaken carefully since they are irreversible once
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-39-</i></p>
         
         the file is saved. Images should initially be captured as accurately as possible; image processing should be reserved for
         optimizing an image, rather than for overcoming poor imaging.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Color correction and tonal adjustments -- </h4>
      
      <p>Many tools exist within numerous applications for correcting image color and adjusting the tonal scale. The actual techniques
         of using them are described in many excellent texts entirely devoted to the subject. There are, however, some general principles
         that should be followed.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>As much as possible, depending on hardware and software available, images should be captured and color corrected in high bit
            depth.
         </li>
         
         <li>Images should be adjusted to render correct highlights and shadows -- usually neutral (but not always), of appropriate brightness,
            and without clipping detail. Also, other neutral colors in the image should not have a color cast (see Aimpoint discussion
            above).
         </li>
         
         <li>Avoid tools with less control that act globally, such as brightness and contrast, and that are more likely to compromise data,
            such as clipping tones.
         </li>
         
         <li>Use tools with more control and numeric feedback, such as levels and curves.</li>
         
         <li>Despite the desire and all technological efforts to base adjustments on objective measurements, some amount of subjective
            evaluation may be necessary and will depend upon operator skill and experience.
         </li>
         
         <li>Do not rely on "auto correct" features. Most automatic color correction tools are designed to work with color photographic
            images and the programmers assumed a standard tone and color distribution that is not likely to match your images (this is
            particularly true for scans of text documents, maps, plans, etc.).
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Sharpening -- </h4>
      
      <p>Digitization utilizes optics in the capture process and the sharpness of different imaging systems varies. Most scans will
         require some amount of sharpening to reproduce the apparent sharpness of the original. Generally, the higher the spatial resolution,
         the less sharpening that will be needed. As the spatial resolution reaches a level that renders fine image detail, such as
         image grain in a photograph, the large features of an image will appear sharp and will not require additional sharpening.
         Conversely, lower resolution images will almost always need some level of sharpening to match the appearance of the original.
      </p>
      
      <p>Sharpening tools available from manufacturers use different controls, but all are based on increasing contrast on either side
         of a defined brightness difference in one or more channels. Sharpening exaggerates the brightness relationship between neighboring
         pixels with different values, and this process improves the perception of sharpness.
      </p>
      
      <p>Sharpening of the production master image files should be done conservatively and judiciously; generally it is better to under-sharpen
         than to over-sharpen. Over-sharpening is irreversible and should be avoided, but it is not objectively measurable. Often over-sharpening
         will appear as a lighter halo between areas of light and dark.
      </p>
      
      <p>We recommend using unsharp mask algorithms, rather than other sharpening tools, because they provide the best visual results
         and usually give greater control over the sharpening parameters. Also -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Sharpening must be evaluated at an appropriate magnification (1:1 or 100%) and the amount of sharpening is contingent on image
               pixel dimensions and subject matter.
            </li>
            
            <li>Sharpening settings for one image or magnification may be inappropriate for another.</li>
            
            <li>In order to avoid color artifacts, or fringing, appropriate options or techniques should be used to limit sharpening only
               to the combined channel brightness.
            </li>
            
            <li>The appropriate amount of sharpening will vary depending on the original, the scanner/digital camera used, and the control
               settings used during digitization.
            </li>
            
         </ul>

         <h3>Sample Image Processing Workflow:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The following provides a general approach to image processing that should help minimize potential image quality defects due
         to various digital image processing limitations and errors. Depending on the scanner/digital camera, scan/capture software,
         scanner/digital camera calibration, and image processing software used for post-scan adjustment and/or correction, not all
         steps may be required and the sequence may need to be modified.
      </p>
      
      <p>Fewer steps may be used in a high-volume scanning environment to enhance productivity, although this may result in less accurate
         tone and color reproduction. You can scan a target, adjust controls based on the scan of the target, and then use the same
         settings for all scans -- this approach should work reasonably well for reflection

         scanning, but will be much harder to do when scanning copy negatives, copy transparencies, original negatives, and original
         slides/transparencies.
      </p>
      
      <p>Consider working in high-bit mode (48-bit RGB or 16-bit grayscale) for as much of the workflow as possible, if the scanner/digital
         camera and software is high-bit capable and your computer has enough memory and speed to work with the larger files. Conversion
         to 24-bit RGB or 8-bit grayscale should be done at the end of the sequence.

         <h2>V. DIGITIZATION SPECIFICATIONS FOR RECORD TYPES</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>The intent of the following tables is to present recommendations for scanning a variety of original materials in a range of
         formats and sizes. The tables are broken down into six main categories: textual documents (including graphic illustrations/artworks/originals,
         maps, plans, and oversized documents); reflective photographic formats (prints); transmissive photographic formats (negatives,
         slides, transparencies); reflective aerial photographic formats (prints); transmissive aerial photographic formats (negatives,
         positives); graphic materials (graphic illustrations, drawings, posters); and objects and artifacts.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because there are far too many formats and document characteristics for comprehensive discussion in these guidelines, the
         tables below provide scanning recommendations for the most typical or common document types and photographic formats found
         in most cultural institutions. The table for textual documents is organized around physical characteristics of documents which
         influence capture decisions. The recommended scanning specifications for text support the production of a scan that can be
         reproduced as a legible facsimile at the same size as the original (at 1:1, the smallest significant character should be legible).
         For photographic materials, the tables are organized around a range of formats and sizes that influence capture decisions.
      </p>
      
      <p>NOTE: We recommend digitizing to the original size of the records following the resolution requirements cited in the tables
         (i.e. no magnification, unless scanning from various intermediates). Be aware, many Windows applications will read the resolution
         of image files as 72 ppi by default and the image dimensions will be incorrect.
      </p>
      
      <p>Workflow requirements, actual usage needs for the image files, and equipment limitations will all be influential factors for
         decisions regarding how records should be digitized. The recommendations cited in the following section and charts, may not
         always be appropriate. Again, the intent for these <i>Technical Guidelines</i> is to offer a range of options and actual approaches for digitizing records may need to be varied.

         <h3>Cleanliness of work area, digitization equipment, and originals -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Keep work area clean. Scanners, platens, and copy boards will have to be cleaned on a routine basis to eliminate the introduction
         of extraneous dirt and dust to the digital images. Many old documents tend to be dirty and will leave dirt in the work area
         and on scanning equipment.
      </p>
      
      <p>See sample handling guidelines, Appendix E, Records Handling for Digitization, for safe and appropriate handling of original
         records. Photographic originals may need to be carefully dusted with a lint-free, soft-bristle brush to minimize extraneous
         dust (just as is done in a traditional darkroom or for copy photography).

         <h3>Cropping -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>We recommend the entire document be scanned, no cropping allowed. A small border should be visible around the entire document
         or photographic image. Careful placement of documents on flatbed scanners may require the originals to be away from platen
         edge to avoid cropping.
      </p>
      
      <p>For photographic records -- If there is important information on a mount or in the border of a negative, then scan the entire
         mount and the entire negative including the full border. Otherwise, scan photographs so there is only a small border around
         just the image area.

         <h3>Backing reflection originals -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>We recommend backing all originals with a bright white opaque paper (such as a smooth finish cover stock), occasionally, an
         off-white or cream-colored paper may complement the original document and should be used. For most documents, the bright white
         backing will provide a lighter shade for scanner auto-ranging and minimize clipping of detail in the paper of the original
         being scanned. In the graphic arts and photography fields, traditionally items being copied to produce line negatives (somewhat
         equivalent to 1-bit scanning) have been backed with black to minimize bleed-through from the back. However, this can create
         very low contrast and/or grayed-out digital images when the paper of the original document is not opaque and when scanning
         in 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit RGB color. Backing with white paper maximizes the paper brightness of originals and the white
         border around the originals is much less distracting.

         <h3>Scanning encapsulated or sleeved originals -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Scanning/digitizing originals that have been encapsulated or sleeved in polyester film can present problems -- the visual
         appearance is changed and the polyester film can cause Newton's rings and other interference patterns.
      </p>
      
      <p>The polyester film changes the visual appearance of the originals, increasing the visual density. You can compensate for the
         increase by placing the tone and color reference target (photographic gray scale) into a polyester sleeve (this will increase
         the visual density of the reference target by the same amount) and scan using the normal aimpoints.
      </p>
      
      <p>Interference patterns known as Newton's rings are common when two very smooth surfaces are placed in contact, such as placing
         encapsulated or sleeved documents onto the glass platen of a flatbed scanner; the susceptibility and severity of Newton's
         rings varies with the glass used, with coatings on the glass, and with humidity in the work area. These patterns will show
         up in the digital image as multi-colored concentric patterns of various shapes and sizes. Also, we have seen similar interference
         patterns when digitizing encapsulated documents on a digital copy stand using a scanning camera back, even when there is nothing
         in contact with the encapsulation. Given the complex nature of these interference patterns, it is not practical to scan and
         then try to clean-up the image. Some scanners use special glass, known as anti-Newton's ring glass, with a slightly wavy surface
         to prevent Newton's rings from forming.

      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-43-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>To prevent interference patterns, use scanners that have anti-Newton's ring glass and avoid scanning documents in polyester
         film whenever practical and possible. Some originals may be too fragile to be handled directly and will have to be scanned
         in the polyester encapsulation or sleeve. One option is to photograph the encapsulated/sleeved document first and then scan
         the photographic intermediate; generally this approach works well, although we have seen examples of interference patterns
         on copy transparencies (to a much lesser degree compared to direct digitization).

         <h3>Embossed seals -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Some documents have embossed seals, such as notarized documents, or wax seals that are an intrinsic legal aspect of the documents.
         Most scanners are designed with lighting to minimize the three dimensional aspects of the original documents being scanned,
         in order to emphasize the legibility of the text or writing. In most cases, embossed seals or the imprint on a wax seal will
         not be visible and/or legible in digital images from these scanners, and this raises questions about the authenticity of the
         digital representation of the documents. Some scanners have a more directed and/or angled lighting configuration that will
         do a better job reproducing embossed seals. With a few scanners, the operator has the control to turn off one light and scan
         using lighting from only one direction, this approach will work best for documents with embossed or wax seals. Similarly,
         when using a digital copy stand, the lighting can be set up for raking light from one direction (make sure the light is still
         even across the entire document). When working with unidirectional lighting, remember to orient the document so the shadows
         fall at the bottom of the embossment/seal and of the document.

         <h3>Compensating for minor deficiencies -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Scanning at higher than the desired resolution and resampling to the final resolution can minimize certain types of minor
         imaging deficiencies, such as minor color channel misregistration, minor chromatic aberration, and low to moderate levels
         of image noise. Conceptually, the idea is to bury the defects in the fine detail of the higher resolution scan, which are
         then averaged out when the pixels are resampled to a lower resolution. This approach should not be used as a panacea for poorly
         performing scanners/digital cameras, generally it is better to invest in higher quality digitization equipment. Before using
         this approach in production, you should run tests to determine there is sufficient improvement in the final image quality
         to justify the extra time and effort. Generally, we recommend over-scanning at 1.5 times the desired final resolution, as
         an example -- 400 ppi final x 1.5 = 600 ppi scan resolution.

         <h3>Scanning text -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Guidelines have been established in the digital library community that address the most basic requirements for preservation
         digitization of text-based materials, this level of reproduction is defined as a "faithful rendering of the underlying source
         document" as long as the images meet certain criteria. These criteria include completeness, image quality (tonality and color),
         and the ability to reproduce pages in their correct (original) sequence. As a faithful rendering, a digital master will also
         support production of a printed page facsimile that is a legible facsimile when produced in the same size as the original
         (that is 1:1). See the Digital Library Federation's <i>Benchmark for Faithful Digital Reproductions of Monographs and Serials</i> at <a href="/standards/bmarkfin.htm">http://www.diglib.org/standards/bmarkfin.htm</a> for a detailed discussion.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Quality Index (QI) measurement was designed for printed text where character height represents the measure of detail.
         Cornell University has developed a formula for QI based on translating the Quality Index method developed for preservation
         microfilming standards to the digital world. The QI formula for scanning text relates quality (QI) to character size (h) in
         mm and resolution (dpi). As in the preservation microfilming standard, the digital QI formula forecasts levels of image quality:
         barely legible (3.0), marginal (3.6), good (5.0), and excellent (8.0). However, manuscripts and other non-textual material
         representing distinct edge-based graphics, such as maps, sketches, and engravings, offer no equivalent fixed metric. For many
         such documents, a better representation of detail would be the width of the finest line, stroke, or marking that must be captured
         in the digital surrogate. To fully represent such a detail, at least 2 pixels should cover it. (From <i>Moving Theory into Practice:

      <p>Optical character recognition, the process of converting a raster image of text into searchable ASCII data, is not addressed

      <p>Scanning oversized originals can produce very large file sizes. It is important to evaluate the need for legibility of small
         significant characters in comparison to the overall file size when determining the appropriate scanning resolution for oversized
         originals.

         <h3>Scanning photographs -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The intent in scanning photographs is to maintain the smallest significant details. Resolution requirements for photographs
         are often difficult to determine because there is no obvious fixed metric for measuring detail, such as quality index. Additionally,
         accurate tone and color reproduction in the scan play an equal, if not more, important role in assessing the quality of a
         scan of a photograph. At this time, we do not feel that there is a valid counterpart for photographic materials to the DLF
         benchmarks for preservation digitization of text materials.
      </p>
      
      <p>The recommended scanning specifications for photographs support the capture of an appropriate level of detail from the format,
         and, in general, support the reproduction, at a minimum, of a high-quality 8"x10" print of the photograph. For photographic
         formats in particular, it is important to carefully analyze the material prior to scanning, especially if it is not a camera
         original format. Because every generation of photographic copying involves some quality loss, using intermediates, duplicates,
         or copies inherently implies some decrease in quality and may also be accompanied by other problems (such as improper orientation,
         low or high contrast, uneven lighting, etc.).
      </p>
      
      <p>For original color transparencies, the tonal scale and color balance of the digital image should match the original transparency
         being scanned to provide accurate representation of the image.
      </p>
      
      <p>Original photographic negatives are much more difficult to scan compared to positive originals (prints, transparencies, slides,
         etc.), with positives there is an obvious reference image that can be matched and for negatives there is not. When scanning
         negatives, for production master files the tonal orientation should be inverted to produce a positive image. The resulting
         image will need to be adjusted to produce a visually pleasing representation. Digitizing negatives is very analogous to printing
         negatives in a darkroom and it is very dependent on the photographer's/technician's skill and visual literacy to produce a
         good image. There are few objective metrics for evaluating the overall representation of digital images produced from negatives.
      </p>
      
      <p>When working with scans from negatives, care is needed to avoid clipping image detail and to maintain highlight and shadow
         detail. The actual brightness range and levels for images from negatives are very subject dependent, and images may or may
         not have a full tonal range.
      </p>
      
      <p>Often it is better to scan negatives in positive mode (to produce an initial image that appears negative) because frequently
         scanners are not well calibrated for scanning negatives and detail is clipped in either the highlights and/or the shadows.
         After scanning, the image can be inverted to produce a positive image. Also, often it is better to scan older black-and-white
         negatives in color (to produce an initial RGB image) because negatives frequently have staining, discolored film base, retouching,
         intensification, or other discolorations (both intentional and the result of deterioration) that can be minimized by scanning
         in color and performing an appropriate conversion to grayscale. Evaluate each color channel individually to determine the
         channel which minimizes the appearance of any deterioration and optimizes the monochrome image quality, use that channel for
         the conversion to a grayscale image.

         <h3>Scanning microfilm -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>When scanning microfilm, often the desire is to produce images with legible text. Due to photographic limitations of microfilm
         and the variable quality of older microfilm, it may not be possible to produce what would normally be considered reproduction
         quality image files. Your scanning approach may vary from the recommendations cited here for textual records and may be more
         focused on creating digital images with reasonable legibility.
      </p>
      
      <p>For B&amp;W microfilm, scanner software should be used to match the tonal scale of the digital image to the density range of the
         specific negative or positive microfilm being scanned. Example: the minimum density of negative microfilm placed at a maximum
         % black value of 97% and the high density placed at a minimum % black value of 3%.
      </p>
      
      <p><a name="arg2"></a><p>2 From -- Digital and Photographic Imaging Services Price Book, Rieger Communications Inc, Gaithersburg, MD, 2001 -- "In our
            opinion and experience, you will not achieve better results . . . than can be obtained from the scan sizes listed . . . Due
            to the nature of pixel capture, scanning larger does make a difference if the scan is to be used in very high magnification
            enlargements. Scan size should not be allowed to fall below 100 DPI at final magnification for quality results in very large
            prints."

      <h4>Textual Documents -- </h4>
      
      <p><img src="images/textdocs.jpg"></p>
      
      <p>Documents with well defined printed type (e.g. typeset, typed, laser printed, etc.), with high inherent contrast between the
         ink of the text and the paper background, with clean paper (no staining or discoloration), and no low contrast annotations
         (such as pencil writing) can be digitized either as a 1-bit file (shown on left) with just black and white pixels (no paper
         texture is rendered), as an 8-bit grayscale file (shown in the center) with gray tones ranging from black to white, or as
         a 24-bit RGB color image file (shown on right) with a full range of both tones and colors (notice the paper of the original
         document is an off-white color). [document- President Nixon's Daily Diary, page 3, 7/20/1969, NARA -- Presidential Libraries

      <p><img src="images/lettersht.jpg"></p>
      
      <p>Often grayscale imaging works best for older documents with poor legibility or diffuse characters (e.g. carbon copies, Thermofax/Verifax,
         etc.), with handwritten annotations or other markings, with low inherent contrast between the text and the paper background,
         with staining or fading, and with halftone illustrations or photographs included as part of the documents. Many textual documents
         do not have significant color information and grayscale images will be smaller to store compared to color image files. The
         document above on the left was scanned directly using a book scanner and the document on the right was scanned from 35mm microfilm
         using a grayscale microfilm scanner. [document on left -- from RG 105, Records of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned

      <p>For textual documents where color is important to the interpretation of the information or content, or there is a desire to
         produce the most accurate representation, then scanning in color is the most appropriate approach. The document above on the
         left was scanned from a 4"x5" color copy transparency using a film scanner and the document on the right was scanned directly
         on a flatbed scanner. [document on left -- Telegram from President Lincoln to General Grant, 07/11/1864, RG 107 Records of

      <p>Generally, oversized refers to documents of any type that do not fit easily onto a standard flatbed scanner. The above parchment
         document on the left and the large book on the right were digitized using a copy stand with a large-format camera and a scanning
         digital camera back. Books and other bound materials can be difficult to digitize and often require appropriate types of book
         cradles to prevent damaging the books. [document on the left -- Act Concerning the Library for the Use of both Houses of Congress,

      <p><img src="images/photos.jpg"></p>
      
      <p>There is a wide variety of photographic originals and different types will require different approaches to digitizing. Above
         on the left is a scan of a modern preservation-quality film duplicate negative of a Mathew Brady collodion wet-plate negative.
         Since the modern duplicate negative is in good condition and has a neutral image tone, the negative was scanned as a grayscale
         image on a flatbed scanner. The photograph in the center is a monochrome print from the 1940s that was scanned in color on
         a flatbed scanner because the image tone is very warm and there is some staining on the print; many older "black-and-white"
         prints have image tone and it may be more appropriate to scan these monochrome prints in color. The photo on the right is
         a 4"x5" duplicate color transparency and was scanned in color using a flatbed scanner. [photograph on left -- Gen. Edward

      <h4>Aerial photographs -- </h4>
      
      <p><img src="images/aerphotos.jpg"></p>
      
      <p>Aerial photographs have a lot of fine detail, often require a high degree of enlargement, and may require a higher degree
         of precision regarding the dimensional accuracy of the scans (compared to textual documents or other types of photographs).
         The above two grayscale images were produced by scanning film duplicates of the original aerial negatives using a flatbed
         scanner. The original negative for the image on the left was deteriorated with heavy staining and discoloration, if the original
         was to be scanned one option would be to scan in color and then to convert to grayscale from an individual color channel that
         minimizes the appearance of the staining. [photograph on left -- Roosevelt Inauguration, 01/1941, ON27740, RG373 Records of

      <p>Some originals have graphic content, and will often have some text information as well. The above examples, a poster on the
         left, a political cartoon in the center, and an artist's rendition on the right all fall into this category. The most appropriate
         equipment to digitize these types of records will vary, and will depend on the size of the originals and their physical condition.

      <p>Duplicate negatives and copy negatives can introduce problems in recommending scanning specifications, particularly if there
         is no indication of original size. Any reduction or enlargement in size must be taken into account, if possible. In all cases,
         reproduction to original size is ideal. For copy negatives or
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-53-</i></p>
         
         transparencies of prints, use the specifications for that print size. For duplicates (negatives, slides, transparencies),
         match the original size. However, if original size is not known, the following recommendations are supplied:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li> -- For a copy negative or transparency, scan at a resolution to achieve 4000 pixels across the long dimension.</li>
            
            <li> -- For duplicates, follow the scanning recommendations for the size that matches the actual physical dimensions of the duplicate.</li>
            
            <li>For scanning negatives with multiple images on a single negative, see the section on scanning stereographs below. If a ruler
               has been included in the scan, use it to verify that the image has not been reduced or enlarged before calculating appropriate
               resolution.
            </li>
            
            <li>Although many scanning workflows accommodate capturing in 24-bit color, we do not see any benefit at this time to saving the
               master files of scans produced from modern black-and-white copy negatives and duplicates in RGB. These master scans can be
               reduced to grayscale in the scanning software or during post-processing editing. However, master scans of camera originals
               may be kept in RGB, and specifically recommend RGB for any negatives that contain color information as a result of staining,
               degradation, or intentional color casts.
            </li>
            
            <li>Scanning Negatives: Often photographic negatives are the most difficult originals to scan. Unlike scanning positives, reflection
               prints and transparencies/slides, there are no reference images to which to compare scans. Scanning negatives is very much
               like printing in the darkroom, it is up to the photographer/technician to adjust brightness and contrast to get a good image.
               Scanning negatives is a very subjective process that is very dependent on the skill of the photographer/technician. Also,
               most scanners are not as well calibrated for scanning negatives compared to scanning positives.
            </li>
            
            <li>Often to minimize loss of detail, it is necessary to scan negatives as positives (the image on screen is negative), to invert
               the images in Photoshop, and then to adjust the images.
            </li>
            
            <li>If black-and-white negatives are stained or discolored, we recommend making color RGB scans of the negatives and using the
               channel which minimizes the appearance of the staining/discoloration when viewed as a positive. The image can then be converted
               to a grayscale image.
            </li>

      <p>On the left is an image of a historic black-and-white film negative that was scanned in color with a positive tonal orientation
         (the digital image appears the same as the original negative), this represents a reasonably accurate rendition of the original
         negative. The middle grayscale image shows a direct inversion of the tones, and as shown here, often a direct inversion of
         a scan of a negative will not produce a well-rendered photographic image. The image on the right illustrates an adjusted version
         where the brightness and contrast of the image has been optimized (using "Curves" and "Levels" in Adobe Photoshop software)
         to produce a reasonable representation of the photographic image, these adjustments are very similar to how a photographer
         prints a negative in the darkroom. [photograph -- NRCA-142-INFO01-3169D, RG 142 Records of the TVA, NARA -- Southeast Region

      <p>For stereograph images and other multiple image prints, modified recommended scanning specifications are to scan to original
         size (length of both photos and mount) and add 2000 pixels to the long dimension, in the event that only one of the photographs
         is requested for high-quality reproduction. For example, if the stereograph is 8" on the long dimension, a resolution of 500
         ppi would be required to achieve 4000 pixels across the long dimension for that size format; in this case, adding 2000 pixels
         to the long dimension would require that the stereograph be scanned at 750 ppi to achieve the desired 6000 pixels across the
         long dimension.
      </p>
      
      <p>For photographic prints, size measurements for determining appropriate resolution are based on the size of the image area
         only, excluding any borders, frames, or mounts. However, in order to show that the entire record has been captured, it is
         good practice to capture the border area in the master scan file. In cases where a small image is mounted on a large board
         (particularly where large file sizes may be an issue), it may be desirable to scan the image area only at the appropriate
         resolution for its size, and then scan the entire mount at a resolution that achieves 4000 pixels across the long dimension.

            <li>JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF, JPEG, or .jpg) at highest quality (least compressed setting) acceptable for medium and
               high resolution requirements.
            </li>
            
            <li>JPEG Interchange Format (JFIF, JPEG, or .jpg) at any compression setting acceptable for low resolution requirements, depending
               on the subject matter of the photograph.
            </li>
            
            <li>Using the TIFF format and JFIF/JPEG format with high-quality low compression will result in relatively large image file sizes.
               Consider using larger memory cards, such as 128 MB or larger, or connecting the camera directly to a computer. Select digital
               cameras that use common or popular memory card formats.

         <h3>File Formats:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>We recommend the Tagged Image File Format or TIFF for production master files. Use TIFF version 6, with Intel (Windows) byte
         order. For additional information on file formats for production masters, see Appendix D, File Format Comparison.
      </p>
      
      <p>Uncompressed files are recommended, particularly if files are not actively managed, such as storage on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM.
         If files are actively managed in a digital repository, then you may want to consider using either LZW or ZIP lossless compression
         for the TIFF files. Do not use JPEG compression within the TIFF format.

         <h3>File Naming:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>A file naming scheme should be established prior to capture. The development of a file naming system should take into account
         whether the identifier requires machine- or human-indexing (or both  --  in which case, the image may have multiple identifiers).
         File names can either be meaningful (such as the adoption of an existing identification scheme which correlates the digital
         file with the source material), or non-descriptive (such as a sequential numerical string). Meaningful file names contain
         metadata that is self-referencing; non-descriptive file names are associated with metadata stored elsewhere that serves to
         identify the file. In general, smaller-scale projects may design descriptive file names that facilitate browsing and retrieval;
         large-scale projects may use machine-generated names and rely on the database for sophisticated searching and retrieval of
         associated metadata.
      </p>
      
      <p>In general, we recommend that file names -- 
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Are unique.</li>
            
            <li>Are consistently structured.</li>
            
            <li>Take into account the maximum number of items to be scanned and reflect that in the number of digits used (if following a
               numerical scheme).
            </li>
            
            <li>Use leading 0's to facilitate sorting in numerical order (if following a numerical scheme).</li>
            
            <li>Do not use an overly complex or lengthy naming scheme that is susceptible to human error during manual input.</li>
            
            <li>Use lowercase characters and file extensions.</li>
            
            <li>Use numbers and/or letters but not characters such as symbols or spaces that could cause complications across operating platforms.</li>
            
            <li>Record metadata embedded in file names (such as scan date, page number, etc.) in another location in addition to the file
               name. This provides a safety net for moving files across systems in the future, in the event that they must be renamed.
            </li>
            
            <li>In particular, sequencing information and major structural divisions of multi-part objects should be explicitly recorded in
               the structural metadata and not only embedded in filenames.
            </li>
            
            <li>Although it is not recommended to embed too much information into the file name, a certain amount of information can serve
               as minimal descriptive metadata for the file, as an economical alternative to the provision of richer data elsewhere.
            </li>
            
            <li>Alternatively, if meaning is judged to be temporal, it may be more practical to use a simple numbering system. An intellectually
               meaningful name will then have to be correlated with the digital resource in the database.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Directory structure -- </h4>
      
      <p>Regardless of file name, files will likely be organized in some kind of file directory system that will link to metadata stored
         elsewhere in a database. Production master files might be stored separately from derivative files, or directories may have
         their own organization independent of the image files, such as folders arranged by date or record group number, or they may
         replicate the physical or logical organization of the originals being scanned.
      </p>
      
      <p>The files themselves can also be organized solely by directory structure and folders rather than embedding meaning in the
         file name. This approach generally works well for multi-page items. Images are uniquely identified and aggregated at the level
         of the logical object (i.e., a book, a chapter, an issue, etc.), which requires that the folders or directories be named descriptively.
         The file names of the individual images themselves are unique only within each directory, but not across directories. For
         example, book 0001 contains image files 001.tif, 002.tif, 003.tif, etc. Book 0002 contains image files 001.tif, 002.tif, 003.tif.
         The danger with this approach is that if individual images are separated from their parent directory, they will be indistinguishable
         from images in a different directory.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-61-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>In the absence of a formal directory structure, we are currently using meaningful file names. The item being scanned is assigned
         a 5-digit unique identifier (assigned at the logical level). This identifier has no meaning in the scanning process, but does
         carry meaning in a system that links the image file(s) to descriptive information. Also embedded in the file name is the year
         the file was scanned as well as a 3-digit sequential number that indicates multiple pages. This number simply records the
         number of files belonging to an object; it does not correlate with actual page numbers. The organization is: logical item
         ID_scan year_page or file number_role of image.tif; e.g., 00001_2003_001_MA.tif.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Versioning -- </h4>
      
      <p>For various reasons, a single scanned object may have multiple but differing versions associated with it (for example, the
         same image prepped for different output intents, versions with additional edits, layers, or alpha channels that are worth
         saving, versions scanned on different scanners, scanned from different original media, scanned at different times by different
         scanner operators, etc.). Ideally, the description and intent of different versions should be reflected in the metadata; but
         if the naming convention is consistent, distinguishing versions in the file name will allow for quick identification of a
         particular image. Like derivative files, this usually implies the application of a qualifier to part of the file name. The
         reason to use qualifiers rather than entirely new names is to keep all versions associated with a logical object under the
         same identifier. An approach to naming versions should be well thought out; adding 001, 002, etc. to the base file name to
         indicate different versions is an option; however, if 001 and 002 already denote page numbers, a different approach will be
         required.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Naming derivative files -- </h4>
      
      <p>The file naming system should also take into account the creation of derivative image files made from the production master
         files. In general, derivative file names are inherited from the production masters, usually with a qualifier added on to distinguish
         the role of the derivative from other files (i.e., "pr" for printing version, "t" for thumbnail, etc.) Derived files usually
         imply a change in image dimensions, image resolution, and/or file format from the production master. Derivative file names
         do not have to be descriptive as long as they can be linked back to the production master file.
      </p>
      
      <p>For derivative files intended primarily for Web display, one consideration for naming is that images may need to be cited
         by users in order to retrieve other higher-quality versions. If so, the derivative file name should contain enough descriptive
         or numerical meaning to allow for easy retrieval of the original or other digital versions.

      <center>
         <h3>Storage Recommendations:</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>We recommend that production master image files be stored on hard drive systems with a level of data redundancy, such as RAID
         drives, rather than on optical media, such as CD-R. An additional set of images with metadata stored on an open standard tape
         format (such as LTO) is recommended (CD-R as backup is a less desirable option), and a backup copy should be stored offsite.
         Regular backups of the images onto tape from the RAID drives is also recommended. A checksum should be generated and should
         be stored with the image files.
      </p>
      
      <p>Currently, we use CD-ROMs for distribution of images to external sources, not as a long-term storage medium. However, if images
         are stored on CD-ROMs, we recommend using high quality or "archival" quality CD-Rs (such as Mitsui Gold Archive CD-Rs). The
         term "archival" indicates the materials used to manufacture the CD-R (usually the dye layer where the data is recording, a
         protective gold layer to prevent pollutants from attacking the dye, or a physically durable top-coat to protect the surface
         of the disk) are reasonably stable and have good durability, but this will not guarantee the longevity of the media itself.
         All disks need to be stored and handled properly. We have found files stored on brand name CD-Rs that we have not been able
         to open less than a year after they have been written to the media. We recommend not using inexpensive or non-brand name CD-Rs,
         because generally they will be less stable, less durable, and more prone to recording problems. Two (or more) copies should
         be made; one copy should not be handled and should be stored offsite. Most importantly, a procedure for migration of the files
         off of the CD-ROMs should be in place. In addition, all copies of the CD-ROMs should be periodically checked using a metric
         such as a CRC (cyclic redundancy checksum) for data integrity. For large-scale projects or for projects that create very large
         image files, the limited capacity of CD-R storage will be problematic. DVD-Rs may be considered for large projects, however,
         DVD formats are not as standardized as the lower-capacity CD-ROM formats, and compatibility and obsolescence in the near future
         is likely to be a problem.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Digital repositories and the long-term management of files and metadata -- </h4>
      
      <p>Digitization of archival records and creation of metadata represent a significant investment in terms of time and money. Is
         it important to realize the protection of these investments will require the active management of both the

         image files and the associated metadata. Storing files to CD-R or DVD-R and putting them on a shelf will not ensure the long-term
         viability of the digital images or the continuing access to them. We recommend digital image files and associated metadata
         be stored and managed in a digital repository, see <a href="www.rlg.org/longterm">www.rlg.org/longterm</a>, <a href="www.nla.gov.au/padi/">www.nla.gov.au/padi/</a>, and <a href="www.dpconline.org/">www.dpconline.org/</a>. The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model standard describes the functionality of a digital repository

NARA is working to develop a large scale IT infrastructure for the management of, preservation of, and access to electronic
         records, the Electronic Records Archive (ERA) project. Information is available at <a href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html</a>. ERA will be an appropriate repository for managing and providing access to digital copies of physical records.

         <h2>VII. QUALITY CONTROL</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>Quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) are the processes used to ensure digitization and metadata creation are done
         properly. QC/QA plans and procedures should address issues relating to the image files, the associated metadata, and the storage
         of both (file transfer, data integrity). Also, QC/QA plans should address accuracy requirements for and acceptable error rates
         for all aspects evaluated. For large digitization projects it may be appropriate to use a statistically valid sampling procedure
         to inspect files and metadata. In most situations QC/QA are done in a 2-step process -- the scanning technician will do initial
         quality checks during production and this is followed by a second check by another person.
      </p>
      
      <p>A quality control program should be initiated, documented, and maintained throughout all phases of digital conversion. The
         quality control plan should address all specifications and reporting requirements associated with each phase of the conversion

         <h3>Quality control of metadata -- </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Quality control of metadata should be integrated into the workflow of any digital imaging project. Because metadata is critical
         to the identification, discovery, management, access, preservation, and use of digital resources, it should be subject to
         quality control procedures similar to those used for verifying the quality of digital images. Since metadata is often created
         and modified at many points during an image's life cycle, metadata review should be an ongoing process that extends across
         all phases of an imaging project and beyond.
      </p>
      
      <p>As with image quality control, a formal review process should also be designed for metadata. The same questions should be
         asked regarding who will review the metadata, the scope of the review, and how great a tolerance is allowed for errors.
      </p>
      
      <p>Practical approaches to metadata review may depend on how and where the metadata is stored, as well as the extent of metadata
         recorded. It is less likely that automated techniques will be as effective in assessing the accuracy, completeness, and utility
         of metadata <i>content</i> (depending on its complexity), which will require some level of manual analysis. Metadata quality assessment will likely
         require skilled human evaluation rather than machine evaluation. However, some aspects of managing metadata stored within
         a system can be monitored using automated system tools (for example, a digital asset management system might handle verification
         of relationships between different versions of an image, produce transaction logs of changes to data, produce derivative images
         and record information about the conversion process, run error detection routines, etc.). Tools such as checksums (for example,
         the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm) can be used to assist in the verification of data that is transferred or archived.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although there are no clearly defined metrics for evaluating metadata quality, the areas listed below can serve as a starting
         point for metadata review. Good practice is to review metadata at the time of image quality review. In general, we consider:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li><i>Adherence to standards set by institutional policy or by the requirements of the imaging project</i>. <br>Conformance to a recognized standard, such as Dublin Core for descriptive metadata and the <i>NISO Data Dictionary -- Technical Metadata for Digital Still Images</i> for technical and production metadata, is recommended and will allow for better exchange of files and more straightforward
               interpretation of the data. Metadata stored in encoded schemes such as XML can be parsed and validated using automated tools;
               however, these tools do not verify accuracy of the content, only accurate syntax. We recommend the use of controlled vocabulary
               fields or authority files whenever possible to eliminate ambiguous terms; or the use of a locally created standardized terms
               list.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Procedures for accommodating images with incomplete metadata</i>. <br>Often images obtained from various sources are represented among the digital images that NARA manages. Procedures for dealing
               with images with incomplete metadata should be in place. The minimal amount of metadata that is acceptable for managing images
               (such as a unique identifier, or a brief descriptive title or caption, etc.) should be determined. If there is no metadata
               associated with an image, would this preclude the image from being maintained over time?
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Relevancy and accuracy of metadata</i>. <br>How are data input errors handled? Poor quality metadata means that a resource is essentially invisible and cannot be tracked
               or used. Check for correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation, especially for manually keyed data.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Consistency in the creation of metadata and in interpretation of metadata</i>. <br>Data should conform to the data constraints of header or database fields, which should be well-defined. Values entered into
               fields should not be ambiguous. Limit the number of free text fields. Documentation such as a data dictionary can provide
               further clarification on acceptable field values.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Consistency and completeness in the level at which metadata is applied</i>. <br>Metadata is collected on many hierarchical levels (file, series, collection, record group, etc.), across many versions (format,
               size, quality), and applies to different logical parts (item or document level, page level, etc.). Information may be mandatory
               at some levels and not at others. Data constants can be applied at higher levels and inherited down if they apply to all images
               in a set.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Evaluation of the usefulness of the metadata being collected</i>. <br>Is the information being recorded useful for resource discovery or management of image files over time? This is an ongoing
               process that should allow for new metadata to be collected as necessary.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>-65-</i></p>
            
            
            <li><i>Synchronization of metadata stored in more than one location</i>. <br>Procedures should be in place to make sure metadata is updated across more than one location. Information related to the image
               might be stored in the TIFF header, the digital asset management system, and other databases, for example.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Representation of different types of metadata</i>. <br>Has sufficient descriptive, technical, and administrative metadata been provided? All types must be present to ensure preservation
               of and access to a resource. All mandatory fields should be complete.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Mechanics of the metadata review process</i>. <br>A system to track the review process itself is helpful; this could be tracked using a database or a folder system that indicates
               status.
            </li>
            
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Specifically, we consider:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li><i>Verifying accuracy of file identifier</i>. <br>File names should consistently and uniquely identify both the digital resource and the metadata record (if it exists independently
               of the file). File identifiers will likely exist for the metadata record itself in addition to identifiers for the digitized
               resource, which may embed information such as page or piece number, date, project or institution identifier, among others.
               Information embedded in file identifiers for the resource should parallel metadata stored in a database record or header.
               Identifiers often serve as the link from the file to information stored in other databases and must be accurate to bring together
               distributed metadata about a resource. Verification of identifiers across metadata in disparate locations should be made.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Verifying accuracy and completeness of information in image header tags</i>. <br>The file browser tool in Adobe Photoshop 7.0 can be used to display some of the default TIFF header fields and IPTC fields
               for quick review of data in the header; however, the tool does not allow for the creation or editing of header information.
               Special software is required for editing TIFF header tags.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Verifying the correct sequence and completeness of multi-page items</i>. <br>Pages should be in the correct order with no missing pages. If significant components of the resource are recorded in the
               metadata, such as chapter headings or other intellectual divisions of a resource, they should match up with the actual image
               files. For complex items such as folded pamphlets or multiple views of an item (a double page spread, each individual page,
               and a close-up section of a page, for example), a convention for describing these views should be followed and should match
               with the actual image files.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            
            <li><i>Adherence to agreed-upon conventions and terminology</i>. <br>Descriptions of components of multi-page pieces (i.e., is "front" and "back" or "recto" and "verso" used?) or descriptions
               of source material, for example, should follow a pre-defined, shared vocabulary.
            </li>
            
         </ul>

      <p>In order to consider using digitization as a method of preservation reformatting it will be necessary to specify much more

                  future users about the nature of the originals that were digitized. At this point in time, no approaches to color reproduction
                  have been agreed upon as appropriate for preservation digitization. <br><br>If analog preservation reformatting is used as a model, then one analogous conceptual approach to tone reproduction would
                  be to digitize so the density values of the originals are rendered in a linear relationship to the lightness channel in the
                  LAB color mode. The lightness channel should be correlated to specified density ranges appropriate for different types of
                  originals -- as examples, for most reflection scanning a range of 2.0 to 2.2, for transmission scanning of most older photographic
                  negatives a range of 2.0 to 2.2, and for transmission scanning of color transparencies/slides a range of 3.2 to 3.8. <br><br>Many tone reproduction approaches that tell us about the nature of the originals are likely to produce master image files
                  that are not directly usable on-screen or for printing without adjustment. It will be necessary to make production master
                  derivative files brought to a common rendition to facilitate use. For many types of master files this will be a very manual
                  process (like images from photographic negatives) and will not lend itself to automation. <br><br>The need for a known rendering in regards to originals argues against saving raw and unadjusted files as preservation masters.
                  <br><br>For some types of originals, a tone reproduction based upon average or generic monitor display (as described in these Technical
                  Guidelines) may be appropriate for preservation master files.

                  RGB, the images have to be converted to LAB and this process does entail potential loss of image quality. Also, LAB master
                  files would have to be converted back to RGB to be used, another transformation and potential loss of image quality. <br><br>Also, the imaging field is looking at multi-spectral imaging to provide the best color reproduction and to eliminate problems
                  like metamerisms. At this time, standard computer software is not capable of dealing with multi-spectral data. Also, depending
                  on the number of bands of wavelengths sampled, the amount of data generated is significantly more than standard 3-channel
                  color digitization. If multi-spectral imaging was feasible from a technical perspective, it would be preferable for preservation
                  digitization. However, at this time there is no simple raster image format that could be used for storing multi-spectral data.
                  The JPEG 2000 file format could be used, but this is a high encoded wavelet based format that does not save the raster data
                  (it does not save the actual bits that represent the pixels, instead it recreates the data representing the pixels). To use
                  a simple raster image format like TIFF it would probably be necessary to convert the multi-spectral data to 3-channel RGB
                  data; hopefully this would produce a very accurate RGB file, but the multispectral data would not be saved.

                  long as a QI of 8 is maintained for all significant text. This approach is based on typical legibility achieved on 35mm microfilm
                  (the current standard for preservation reformatting of text-based originals), and studies of human perception indicate this
                  is a reasonable threshold in regards to the level of detail perceived by the naked eye (without magnification). Certainly
                  all originals have extremely fine detail that is not accurately rendered at 400 ppi. Also, for some reproduction requirements
                  this resolution level may be too low, although the need for very large reproduction is infrequent. <br><br>Unlike text-based originals, it is very difficult to determine appropriate resolution levels for preservation digitization
                  of many types of photographic originals. For analog photographic preservation duplication, the common approach is to use photographic
                  films that have finer grain and higher resolution than the majority of originals being duplicated. The analogous approach
                  in the digital environment would be to digitize all photographic camera originals at a resolution of 3,000 ppi to 4,000 ppi
                  regardless of size. Desired resolution levels may be difficult to achieve given limitations of current scanners.

                  are three-dimensional nonetheless) into two-dimensional images or representations. Most scanners are designed with lighting
                  to minimize the three dimensional aspects of the original documents being scanned, in order to emphasize the legibility of
                  the text or writing. So not all of the three-dimensional aspects of the documents are recorded well and in many cases are
                  not recorded at all; including properties and features like paper texture and fibers, paper watermarks and laid lines, folds
                  and/or creases, embossed seals, etc. Loss of three-dimensional information may influence a range of archival/curatorial concerns
                  regarding preservation reformatting. These concerns are not unique to digital reformatting, traditional approaches to preservation
                  reformatting, such as microfilming, photocopying (electrophotographic copying on archival bond), and photographic copying/duplication
                  have the same limitations -- they produce two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional originals. One example of a
                  concern about rendering three-dimensional aspects of documents that has legal implications is documents with embossed seals
                  and questions about the authenticity of the digital representation of the documents when the seals are not visible and/or
                  legible in the digital images (a common problem, see Digitization Specifications for Record Types for a short discussion of
                  lighting techniques to improve legibility of embossed seals). Other issues that may need to be considered and appropriate
                  approaches defined prior to starting any reformatting include, but limited to, the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Digitize front and/or back of each document or page -- even if no information is on one side.</li>
                     <li>Reflection and/or transmission scanning for all materials -- to record watermarks, laid lines, paper structure and texture,
                        any damage to the paper, etc.
                     </li>
                     <li>Use of diffuse and/or raking light -- digitize using diffuse light to render text and/or writing accurately, and/or digitize
                        using raking light to render the three dimensionality of the document (folds, creases, embossed seals, etc.).
                     </li>
                     <li>Digitize documents folded and/or unfolded.</li>
                     <li>Digitize documents with attachments in place and/or detached as separate documents.</li>
                     <li>Digitize documents bound and/or unbound.</li>
                  </ul>The question that needs to be answered, and there will probably not be a single answer, is how many representations are needed
                  for preservation reformatting to accurately document the original records? The digital library community needs to discuss
                  these issues and arrive at appropriate approaches for different types of originals. One additional comment, originals for
                  which it is considered appropriate to have multiple representations in order to be considered preservation reformatting probably
                  warrant preservation in original form.

      <p>JPEG compression was designed for photographic images and sacrifices fine detail to save space when stored, while preserving
         the large features of an image. JPEG compression creates artifacts around text when used with digital images of text documents
         at moderate to high compression levels. Also, JPEG files will be either 24-bit RGB images or 8-bit grayscale, they can not
         have lower bit depths.
      </p>
      
      <p>GIF files use LZW compression (typical compression ratio is 2:1, or the file will be half original size), which is lossless
         and does not create image artifacts; therefore, GIF files may be more suitable for access derivatives of text documents. The
         GIF format supports 8-bit (256 colors), or lower, color files and 8-bit, or lower, grayscale files. All color GIF files and
         grayscale GIF files with bit-depths less than 8-bits are usually dithered (the distribution of pixels of different shades
         in areas of another shade to simulate additional shading). Well dithered images using an adaptive palette and diffusion dither
         will visually have a very good appearance, including when used on photographic images. In many cases a well produced GIF file
         will look better, or no worse, than a highly compressed JPEG file (due to the JPEG artifacts and loss of image sharpness),
         and for textual records the appearance of a GIF format derivative is often significantly better than a comparable JPEG file.

      <p>As you can see, when the files are open the GIF file will be smaller due to the lower bit-depth and when stored the JPEG will
         be smaller due to the higher compression ratio. GIF files will take longer to download, but will decompress quicker and put
         less demand on the end user's CPU in terms of memory and processor speed. JPEG files will download quicker, but will take
         longer to decompress putting a greater demand on the end user's CPU. Practical tests have shown a full page of GIF images
         generally will download, decompress, and display more quickly than the same page full of JPEG versions of the images.
      </p>
      
      <p>The newer JPEG 2000 compression algorithm is a wavelet compression, and can be used to compress images to higher compression
         ratios with less loss of image quality compared to the older JPEG algorithm. Generally, JPEG 2000 will not produce the same
         severity of artifacts around text that the original JPEG algorithm produces.

      <p>*Many digitization projects do not make thumbnail files for textual records -- the text is not legible and most documents
         look alike when the images are this small, so thumbnails may have limited usefulness. However, thumbnail images may be needed
         for a variety of web uses or within a database, so many projects do create thumbnails from textual documents.

      <p>Note: Many of the LCDRG elements above use authority lists for data values that may not necessarily map into recommended Dublin
         Core Metadata Initiative typology for vocabulary terms, data values, and syntax or vocabulary encoding schemes. Please consult
         the LCDRG for acceptable data values.
      </p>
      
      <p>This table suggests a simple mapping only. It is evident that Dublin Core elements are extracted from a much richer descriptive
         set outlined in the LCDRG framework. Dublin Core elements are repeatable to accommodate multiple LCDRG fields; however, repeatability
         of fields is not equivalent to the complex structure of archival collections that the LCDRG attempts to capture. As a result,
         mapping to Dublin Core may result in a loss of information specificity and/or meaning in an archival context. A more detailed
         analysis of how LCDRG values are being implemented in Dublin Core will be necessary.

         <h2>APPENDIX D: File Format Comparison</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>As stated earlier, the choice of file format has a direct affect on the performance of the digital image as well as implications
         for long term management of the image. Future preservation policy decisions, such as what level of preservation service to
         apply, are often made on a format-specific basis*. A selection of file formats commonly used for digital still raster images
         are listed below. The first table lists general technical characteristics to consider when choosing an appropriate file format
         as well as a statement on their recommended use in imaging projects. Generally, these are all well-established formats that
         do not pose a big risk to the preservation of content information; however, it is advised that an assessment of the potential
         longevity and future functionality of these formats be undertaken for any digital imaging project. The second table attempts
         to summarize some of these concerns.

               <td colspan="1">
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li><i>Documentation</i>: For both proprietary and open standard formats, is deep technical documentation publicly and fully available? Is it maintained
                        for older versions of the format?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Stability</i>: Is the format supported by current applications? Is the current version backward-compatible? Are there frequent updates
                        to the format or the specification?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Metadata</i>: Does the format allow for self-documentation? Does the format support extensive embedded metadata beyond what is necessary
                        for normal rendering of a file? Can the file support a basic level of descriptive, technical, administrative, and rights metadata?
                        Can metadata be encoded and stored in XML or other standardized formats? Is metadata easily extracted from the file?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Presentation: </i>Does the format contain embedded objects (e.g. fonts, raster images) and/or link out to external objects? Does the format
                        provide functionality for preserving the layout and structure of document, if this is important?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Complexity</i>: Simple raster formats are preferred. Can the file be easily unpacked? Can content be easily separated from the container?
                        Is "uncompressed" an option for storing data? Does the format incorporate external programs (e.g., Javascript, etc.)? Complexity
                        of format is often associated with risk management  --  more complex formats are assumed to be harder to decode. However,
                        some formats are by necessity complex based on their purpose and intended functionality. Complex formats should not be avoided
                        solely on the basis that they are forecast to be difficult to preserve, at the expense of using the best format for the use
                        of the data it contains.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Adoption</i>: Is the format widely used by the imaging community in cultural institutions? How is it generally used by these stakeholders
                         --  as a master format, a delivery format?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Continuity</i>: How long has the format been in existence? Is the file format mature (most of the image formats in the table above have
                        been in existence for over 10 years).
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Protection</i>: Does the format accommodate error detection and correction mechanisms and encryption options? These are related to complexity
                        of the file. In general, encryption and digital signatures may deter full preservation service levels.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Compression algorithms</i>: Does the format use standard algorithms? In general, compression use in files may deter full preservation service levels;
                        however, this may have less to do with file complexity and more to do with patent issues surrounding specific compression
                        algorithms.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Interoperability</i>: Is the format supported by many software applications / OS platforms or is it linked closely with a specific application?
                        Are there numerous applications that utilize this format? Have useful tools been built up around the format? Are there open
                        source tools available to use and develop the format? Is access functionality improved by native support in web browsers?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Dependencies</i>: Does the format require a plug-in for viewing if appropriate software is not available, or rely on external programs to
                        function?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Significant properties</i>: Does the format accommodate high-bit, high-resolution (detail), color accuracy, multiple compression options? (These are
                        all technical qualities important to master image files).
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Ease of transformation/preservation:</i> Is it likely that the format will be supported for full functional preservation in a repository setting, or can guarantees
                        currently only be made at the bitstream (content data) level (where only limited characteristics of the format are maintained)?
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><i>Packaging formats:</i> In general, packaging formats such as zip and tar files should be acceptable as transfer mechanisms for image file formats.
                        These are not normally used for storage/archiving.
                     </li>

            <li>The unit/partner/contractor shall place archival materials flat on the platen -- rolling, pulling, bending, or folding of
               archival materials is not permitted, and items shall be supported over their entire surface on the platen -- no part of an
               item shall overhang the platen so that it is unsupported at any time. The unit/partner/contractor shall not place archival
               materials that may be damaged, such as rolled, folded, warped, curling, or on warped and/or fragile mounts, on the platen.
               The unit/partner/contractor shall place only one physical item at a time on a surface appropriate for the item's size and
               format, except when scanning 35mm slides in a batch mode on a flatbed scanner. The unit/partner/contractor shall handle archival
               materials in bound volumes carefully and not force them open or place them face down. The unit/partner/contractor shall use
               book cradles to support volumes, and volumes shall be digitized in a face up orientation on cradles.
            </li>
            
            <li>The unit/partner/contractor shall not place objects such as books, papers, pens, and pencils on archival materials or their
               containers. The unit/partner/contractor shall not lean on, sit on, or otherwise apply pressure to archival materials or their
               containers. The unit/partner/contractor shall use only lead pencils as writing implements near archival materials or their
               containers. The unit/partner/contractor shall not write on or otherwise mark archival materials, jackets, or containers. The
               unit/partner/contractor shall not use Tacky finger, rubber fingers, or other materials to increase tackiness that may transfer
               residue to the records.
            </li>
            
            <li>The unit/partner/contractor shall not smoke, drink, or eat in the room where archival materials or their containers are located.
               The unit/partner/contractor shall not permit anyone to bring tobacco, liquids, and food into the room where archival materials
               or their containers are located.
            </li>
            
            <li>Unit/partner/contractor staff shall clean their hands prior to handling records and avoid the use of hand lotions before working
               with archival materials. Unit/partner/contractor staff shall wear clean white cotton gloves at all times when handling photographic
               film materials, such as negatives, color transparencies, aerial film, microfilm, etc. The unit/partner/contractor shall provide
               gloves. For some types of originals using cotton gloves can inhibit safe handling, such as when working with glass plate negatives.
            </li>
            
            <li>The unit/partner/contractor shall reinsert all photographic negatives, and other sheet film, removed from jackets in proper
               orientation with the emulsion side away from the seams. The unit/partner/contractor shall unwind roll film carefully and rewind
               roll film as soon as the digitizing is finished. The unit/partner/contractor shall rewind any rolls of film with the emulsion
               side in and with the head/start of the roll out.
            </li>
            
            <li>NARA custodial staff and Preservation Programs, NWT, shall have the right to inspect, without notice, the unit/partner/contractor
               work areas and digitizing procedures or to be present at all times when archival materials are being handled. Units/partners/contractors
               are encouraged to consult with Preservation
