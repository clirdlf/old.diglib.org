<h2>A. Collections</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Most collections are developed to support campus teaching and
research initiatives or as larger preservation and access efforts
for the scholarly community at large. The main units involved in
development of digital initiatives within the Emory libraries
are:</p>

<ul>

<li>       The Beck Center for Electronic Collections
and Services - focusing primarily on texts in the humanities</li>

<li>      The Electronic Data Center - focusing
primarily on the identification and management of quantitative
data sets appropriate for research in the social sciences</li>

<li>     Hugh MacMillan Law Library - serving as the
official digitizing and service point <i>Federal Court
Finder</i>, the electronic full text archive of decisions handed
down by Federal Circuit Court s of Appeals</li>

<li>      Health Sciences Center Library - focuses on
MedWeb, a widely acclaimed gateway to biomedical Internet
sites</li>

<li>     Pitts Theology Library - serving as the
digital archive for the SELA Full text journal project (the
foundation for the expanded ATLAS full text e-journal collection
maintained by the American Theological Library Association)</li>

<li>   Preservation and Conservation - focusing on
both print and non-print materials, including audio and video,
held in the Emory libraries</li>

<li>       Special Collections and Archives - focusing
on print and non-print materials in its collections, notably in
Irish and African-American literature</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the digital collections currently offered:</p>

<h3>The Belfast Group Sheets</h3>

<p>In 1963 Philip Hobsbaum, a recently-arrived lecturer in
English at Queen's University, Belfast, organized a writing
workshop made up of students, faculty, and a number of writers
from the local community. The Group, as it has come to be known,
met regularly during term. When Hobsbaum left Belfast for the
University of Glasgow, Seamus Heaney assumed responsibility for
organizing the meetings. Later Michael Allen and Arthur Terry,
both lecturers at Queen's, played organizational roles as
well.</p>

<p>The Belfast Group ceased altogether in 1972 at a time when a
remarkable number of the participants had published their first
collections and launched promising literary careers. The
participation of so many talented writers ensures that the Group
will remain of lasting interest to scholars and literary
historians.</p>

<p>The original Group sheets, from which these searchable
electronic texts have been prepared, are housed in the Special
Collections Department of the Robert W. Woodruff Library of Emory
University and in the Irish Collection of the Queen's University
Library. This digital collection forms one part of Emory's larger
<b>Poetry Portal</b> (see below). <b><a
href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/irishpoet/">http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/irishpoet/</a></b></p>

<h3>The Civil War in America from the <i>Illustrated London
News</i> (ILN)</h3>

<p>A searchable text base of articles from the ILN documenting
the Civil War. The search interface is available for v. 38, and
the ILN is now browseable as well both by article title and by
illustrations. <b><a
href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/iln/">http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/iln/</a></b></p>

<h3>Constituent Mail Analysis</h3>

<p>The Constituent Mail Analysis Project (CMAP) explores the
possibilities for studying constituent mail using congressional
correspondence management system files generated by the United
States Senate Computer Center.</p>

<p>Sam Nunn represented Georgia in the U.S. Senate from 1972 to
1996 and his papers, now at Emory University, provide an example
of the types of benefits and challenges offered by correspondence
management systems. CMAP has used the Nunn databases in its pilot
project to demonstrate the kinds of studies that might be done
using such data. CMAP focuses in particular on constituent
interest in and opinions on legislative issues as expressed in
their correspondence with Senator Nunn. In the future, Emory's
Electronic Data Center hopes to include data from other U.S.
Senators to allow researchers to compare the mail received in
different offices.</p>

<h3>Data Sets and Geographic Information Systems</h3>

<p>The General Libraries Electronic Data Center distributes
popular data sets in a variety of subject areas. During the
2003-04 academic year, the  interface for accessing this
collection of data sets was migrated into a  new XML database
using the Data Documentation Initiatve metadata standard  (<a
href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/">http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/DDI/</a>)
so as to ensure more efficient searching capabilities.</p>

<p>In addition, the EDC allows users to create subsets of two
large and  commonly-used datasets - Elections in Western Europe
since 1815 and the</p>
<p>IMF Direction of Trade Statistics. Users also have access to a
limited number of geographic information systems data. <b><a
href="http://einstein.library.emory.edu/">http://einstein.library.emory.edu/</a></b></p>

<h3>Electronic Poetry Project</h3>

<p>An indexed, keyword searchable collection of several
commercially available electronic poetry collections and a
compilation of manuscript poems of the Belfast Group owned by the
Emory libraries. New commercial and unique manuscript works are
being continually added to this digital collection, mounted and
maintained by Emory's Beck Center for Electronic Collections and
Services. See <b>Poetry Portal</b>, below  <b><a
href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/irishpoet/">http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/irishpoet/</a></b></p>

<h3>Emory Women Writers Resource Project</h3>
<p>Working with faculty and graduate students for Emory's English
Department, the Beck Center is creating both HTML and SGML
versions of selected works by American and British women.
Spanning the 17<sup>th</sup> - 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, many of
these digital versions include have been edited and annotated for
in-depth analysis and scholarly research. <b><a
href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/wwrp/index.html">http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/wwrp/index.html</a></b></p>

<h3>Federal Court Finder</h3>
<p>An electronic full text collection of decisions handed down by
the eleven Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal. This site serves as
a full-text archive for decisions handed down in the Federal
Circuit Courts back to 1994. Current decisions are encoded and
added within 24 hours of their public release. <b><a
href="http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDCTS/">http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDCTS/</a></b></p>


<h3>French Revolution Pamphlets Collection</h3>

<p>The result of an ongoing partnership between the Beck Center
and Special Collection s. Of the 3000 pamphlets held by Special
Collections, we are in the process of publishing 89 literary and
satirical works which are not available in electronic form at any
other digital repository. This site serves both as a digital
archive and a research portal to these materials. <b><a
href="http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/frenchrevo/">http://chaucer.library.emory.edu/frenchrevo/</a></b></p>

<h3>Irish Literary Collections Portal</h3>
<p>Provides access to a fully searchable array of finding aids
for the Irish literary manuscript collections held by Emory
University's Robert W. Woodruff Library Special Collections and
Boston College's John J. Burns Library of Rare Books and Special
Collections. By electronically bringing together two of North
America's finest collections of Irish literary manuscripts and
rare books, this site enhances public access to these important
and complementary collections.</p>

<p>Emory's Irish Literary Collections focus on two main areas:
the correspondence, manuscripts and related papers of W.B. Yeats
and his circle, as well as the literary archives of many of
Ireland's finest contemporary poets. Boston College's Irish
Literary Collections also concentrate on the major Irish literary
renaissance figures and the contemporary poets.</p>

<p>The findings aids for this project have been encoded using the
EAD.DTD, Version 2002, an XML-compliant data structure developed
and maintained jointly by the Society of American Archivists and
the Library of Congress. At present this collection remains
separate from Emory's Poetry Portal, but plans are being
developed not only to incorporate this collaborative collection,
but also add records from other academic repositories in the
future.</p>

<h3>The Poetry Portal</h3>

<p>In the fall of 2003 the Beck Center launched an electronic
gateway that supports cross-database searching of five commercial
and in-house digital collections of poetry by author, title,
subject, time period, and first line. Each of the collections
also can be searched individually by keyword. Poems, either
individually or in groups, can be linked to our campus course
content engine, BlackBoard. <b><a

<h3>SAGE: Selected Archives at Georgia Tech and Emory</h3>

<p>A collaborative digital project initially undertaken by the
Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, the SAGE
Project shared their expertise in various areas to digitize
selected texts, photographs, and audio/video recordings from
several collections held at Emory University. Among the
collections covered are the Sam Nunn Papers, the Ralph McGill
papers, the Witness to the Holocaust project files, and the
records of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of
greater Atlanta.  Emory chose to use only open source software in
its implementation. The archive has not been updated since its
conclusion in 2000.</p>

network.</p>
<p><b><a
href="http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=1179">http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=1179</a></b></p>


<h3>ECIT - Emory Center for Interactive Teaching</h3>

<p>Emory's Center for Interactive Teaching (ECIT) provides
support personnel and facilities to assist Emory faculty with
incorporating interactive multimedia technologies into the
teaching experience. Since its inception in 1996, a wide array of
primarily Web-based technologies have been explored, including:
Web site authoring, digital audio and video editing, electronic
bulletin boards, virtual collaboration spaces, Web-based
testing/student tracking and various video-conferencing and
teleconferencing systems. The Center's combination of
technology-based learning systems and support from its
knowledgeable staff continue to enhance the teaching experience
in new and exciting ways. </p>

<p>In the summer of 2004 ECIT was expanded with the addition of
another wired classroom adjacent to the main ECIT space. This new
facility makes use of truly transparent technology. During class
times the facility operates as a fully-wired classroom using
wireless technology, laptop computing, and projectors and display
screens. At night and on weekends the screen and projector
automatically fold into the room&rsquo;s ceiling and the
facility  is turned into an open study space for student use.</p>

<h3>Electronic Resources@Emory</h3>

<p>An attempt to provide more streamlined access to the numerous
electronic and print information sources available to Emory
students, Electronic Resources@Emory brings together key
resources by broad category (e.g. encyclopedias), by subject
(e.g. resources in Anthropology), as well as general guides to
effectively searching the Web and online lists of instructional
sessions and workshops.</p>
<p><b><a
href="http://web.library.emory.edu/services/ressvcs/dblocator/">http://web.library.emory.edu/services/ressvcs/dblocator/</a></b></p>


<h3>Electronic Data Center</h3>

<p>Emory's Electronic Data Center provides researchers and
students with access to several thousand data sets covering
diverse subjects such as criminal justice, electoral behavior,
health indicators, international relations, public opinion, and
economic development. Interested Emory  researchers may access
our internal data holdings  anytime through an on-line catalog
developed in partnership with Emory's Information Technology
Division. Or, users may request that EDC acquire data from
external sources such as the ICPSR, the US Government, and many
other data providers. In some instances users can even work with
the data online. A cluster of high-end workstations equipped with
the latest software applications is located in the EDC to
facilitate research.</p>
<p><b><a
href="http://einstein.library.emory.edu/">http://einstein.library.emory.edu</a></b></p>

<h3>Electronic Document Delivery</h3>

<p>EDD provides digital copies of journal articles or tables of
contents from materials in the Emory libraries off-site storage
facility, the Materiel Center. Digital copies are made available
to users on a library web server in the Adobe PDF format. The
hardware component consists of a Xerox Document Center utilizing
Adobe Acrobat for converting files from various image formats to
PDF.</p>


<h3>Electronic Reserves (Reserves Direct)</h3>

<p>The General Libraries' Electronic Reserves Project seeks to
expand the scope of the traditional reserve reading list to
include both print and electronic formats, and provide a single,
comprehensive list for all materials needed for a particular
course. Electronic reserve materials can include class Web sites,
Web-based conferences, electronic journal articles, or scanned
images of course-related documents. These electronic materials
can be accessed directly through WebCat, the web based version of
the library catalog, EUCLID. Students search for their reserve
list in the library catalog, and when an electronic version of
the material is available, can click on a hyperlink within the
reserve record to access that material. Electronic access to
reserve material offers greater convenience in that students can
access this material at any hour using the Internet.</p>

<p>Using open source programming that is made available free of
charge to other libraries worldwide, Emory's <i>Reserves
Direct</i> system makes placing materials on reserve in the
library for each class as simple as can be. Faculty have the
option not only of adding their own photocopies by fax, but also
of sorting reserve items by author, title or syllabus. They also
can easily carry over items repeated from earlier semesters,
annotate items with comments or instructions right online, or add
URLs themselves, all of which become available to the user
instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Wireless Networks</h3>

<p>As part of our continuing effort to provide easy access to
information resources, the General Libraries, in collaboration
with Emory's Information Technology Division, installed a
wireless DHCP network in selected areas of the General Libraries
by 2001. This was the first and largest wireless installation on
campus, supporting the use of student laptop connectivity
anywhere in the facility. The installation has been so well
received that Emory&rsquo;s Student Government Association
endorsed the installation of numerous &ldquo;public
commons&rdquo; wireless zones throughout the campus, a project
that will be implemented during the 2004-05 academic year. The
first building/area-wide installation will be the General
Libraries. Installation is due to be completed by December
2004.</p>

<h3>C. Systems</h3>
<blockquote>

<p>The libraries have adopted use of Extensible Markup Language
(XML), the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Dublin Core, the
Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and SPSS and Stata
statistical analysis software for digital information resources
developed on campus. Extant digital collections previously
developed on campus gradually are being migrated into XML. All
current and future digital initiatives will be developed using
the above markup standards.</p>

collection is unique in the Southeast and illustrates the
often-delicate business of selling race-related movies to white
and black audiences. The strength of the collection resides in
the period from 1920-1980, which can be divided into four
chronological and thematic topics: race films (1920-1949),
&ldquo;integration&rdquo; motion pictures (1950-1959), movies
that reconsider the South (1960-1969), and blaxploitation films
(1970-1980).</p>

<p>The collection is keyword searchable. Due to copyright
constraints on this ephemeral material, no digital
representations of collection materials are as yet available.</p>

<h3>Danowski Poetry Collection (in development)</h3>

<p>In 2004 Emory University&rsquo;s Special Collections
Department acquired the Danowski Poetry The collection,
considered the largest ever built by a private collector,
comprises some 60,000 books as well as tens of thousands of
periodicals, manuscripts, correspondence and other materials, and
makes the university one of the world's most renowned
destinations for the study of contemporary English-language
poetry.</p>

<p>A retired London art dealer who now resides in South Africa,
Danowski began his efforts in the 1970s. Soon he became a
full-fledged bibliophile, and as years passed and his collection
grew, Danowski and his books began to attract interest
themselves. He formed Poets' Trust, a foundation to manage the
collection, and soon his obsession with building the library
became an obsession with finding a proper home for it. But there
was one problem: By the early '90s, Danowski's collection was so
massive that selling it whole would be impossible; no single
buyer could pay what it was worth. He would either have to break
it up or essentially give it away. Once he learned the kind of
home Emory would provide for the collection, Danowski chose the
second option.</p>
<p>By early 2005 an inventory of the entire Danowski Poetry
Collection will be mounted online, searchable by author, title,
and possibly by keyword. For more information on the collection
consult David Faulds, Special Collections Cataloger, <a

<h3>Holocaust Denial on Trial: David Irving vs. Penguin Books
and Deborah Lipstadt (in development)</h3>

<p>In 2000 British Holocaust denier David Irving sued Emory
University professor Deborah Lipstadt and her British publisher,
Penguin Books, for libel. Their London trial made headlines
around the world. Despite England's draconian libel laws,
Lipstadt and Penguin not only won resoundingly but also exposed
the inner workings of the deniers, who distort 20th century
history in order to promote 21st century anti-Semitism and white
supremacy.</p>

<p>This site is built around the defense's groundbreaking
research, the riveting trial-room testimony, and the judge's
historic opinion which found Irving to be a "right-wing pro-Nazi
polemicist" who "deliberately misrepresented and manipulated
historical evidence."</p>

<p>Phase 1 of this project has been completed with the mounting
of HTML versions of the trial transcripts, evidence, and related
reports. Phase 2 will involve TEI encoding of these materials.
Phase 3 (as yet unfunded) proposes enhanced semantic Web
searching and the development of educational modules for use in
grades 6-12 and college courses.  <b><a

<h3>Journal of Cognitive Affective Learning  - JCAL (in
development)</h3>

<p>An open-access digital journal debuting this month, JCAL is a
peer-reviewed journal dedicated to disseminating research on
holistic educational practices that focus on the significance of
the cognitive-affective relationship in promoting deep and
enduring learning. Access to the journal (articles and services)
is free of charge. JCAL publishes theoretical papers, original
research reports, literature reviews, and extended reviews of
selected books.</p>
<p>This new publication is a collaborative effort of
Emory&rsquo;s Oxford College Library and Oxford College
Department of Psychology. This resource will be published via the
Open Journal Systems (OJS), an electronic management and
publishing system for refereed journals developed by the Public
Knowledge Project. The OJS system will provide comprehensive
indexing of published articles using the Open Archives Initiative
(OAI) protocol for metadata harvesting and as an OAI registered
site will be broadly accessible as a part of global system of
scholarly resources. The journal will be archived for future
scholars via the LOCKSS system (http://lockss.stanford.edu). The
LOCKSS system was developed at Stanford University and is
supported by Mellon Foundation funding. Emory University is an
active participant in the LOCKSS project. <b><a

<h3>Luna Imaging InSight Installation (in development)</h3>

<p>In 2003-04 the Woodruff Library and Emory&rsquo;s Information
Technology Division collaborated on the installation of Luna
Imaging&rsquo;s InSight digital image software and oversaw the
digitization of more than 120,000 slides from the university
Visual Resources Library. Planning also was underway to utilize
InSight software to mount and access The Mellon
Foundation&rsquo;s ArtSTOR visual image collection when that
initiative unexpectedly announced it would be using its own
locally-developed viewing application.</p>
<p>Over the next academic year we will launch a hosting project
with ArtSTOR to mount a mirror image of our Visual Resources
digital library as a private &ldquo;local collection&rdquo; on
ArtSTOR&rsquo;s servers, and compare its utility to that of the
Insight viewer. This effort will provide a useful testbed for
local hosting services being explored by ArtSTOR and afford our
campus a crucial comparison of functionalities of the two major
digital image viewers now on the market. For more information on
this imaging project consult Kim Collins, Art History Librarian,
Woodruff Library, <a

<h3>MetaScholar initiatives</h3>

<p>The MetaScholar Initiative at Emory University's Robert W.
Woodruff Library encompasses several projects that provide
meta-information for scholars: useful information about scholarly
information and special collections held by archives, libraries,
museums, and other repositories. The MetaScholar Initiative
currently is comprised of five projects, among them MetaArchive
(<a href="http://metaarchive.org/">http://metaarchive.org/</a>),
MetaCombine (<a
href="http://www.metascholar.org/metacombine.html">http://www.metascholar.org/metacombine.html</a>),
Music for Social Change , and Southern Spaces (<a
href="http://www.southernspaces.org/">http://www.southernspaces.org/</a>).
This Initiative is creating new models for sharing
meta-information and portal services for scholars in focused
research areas.</p>

<p>In September 2004, the General Libraries and its MetaScholar
Initiative was awarded a grant from a Library of Congress-based
effort as part of the National Digital Infrastructure and
Information Preservation Program (NDIIPP). As one of eight funded
projects,: Emory University and its partners (the University of
Louisville Libraries, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University Libraries, Florida State University, Auburn University
Libraries, Georgia Institute of Technology Library and
Information Center.  This project will develop a MetaArchive of
Southern Cultural Heritage (<a
href="http://www.metaarchive.org/">www.metaarchive.org</a>) by
creating a distributed digital preservation network for critical
and at-risk content relative to Southern culture and
history.</p>
<p>The partners will select and preserve institutional digital
archives, as well as ephemeral works such as online exhibitions
and cultural history Web site displays. This body of digital
content includes a wide variety of subjects complementary to
Library of Congress collections such as the Civil War, the civil
rights movement, slave narratives, Southern music, handicrafts
and church history. Amount of award:  $690,390. <a
href="http://www.metascholar.org/">http://www.metascholar.org/</a></p>

<h3>Southern Spaces</h3>

<p>Southern Spaces is a peer-reviewed Internet journal and
scholarly forum that provides open access to essays, gateways,
events and conferences, interviews and performances, and
annotated weblinks on real and imagined places and spaces in the
South. Created at Emory University with support from The Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation, the Editorial Board currently is
commissioning online contextual materials on the South, using
ideas of place and space as organizing principles. Southern
Spaces also welcomes inquiries from those who are interested in
publishing materials on this site. <a
href="http://www.southernspaces.org/">http://www.southernspaces.org/</a></p>

<h3>Women&rsquo;s Genre-Fiction Project</h3>

<p>A subset of Emory&rsquo;s broader Women Writers Resource
Project, this effort by the Beck Center will produce a textbase
of nearly 300 American and British crime, detective, and romance
novels authored by women in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Funded by a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the novels have been fully encoded
in TEI and will be available for searching and browsing in 2005.

<h2>Digital Repositories and the Preservation of Digital
Information</h2>

<p>In the coming year we expect to begin a more extensive study
of the preservation and access issues surrounding the possible
development of digital repositories. The Emory libraries are at a
very early stage of discussion on this topic. We anticipate that
several of our MetaArchive initiatives will help us explore this
field much more thoroughly.</p>

<h2><a id="sec4" name="sec4">Open Proxy Servers and Database
Security</a></h2>

<p>Delivering online services outside of library buildings and
off-campus at universities and colleges continues to be a major
and essential part of what we do in libraries. The method that
has become standard to support remote access to online services
from users' homes and offices is the proxy server, which acts as
an intermediary between the remote users and the database servers
that the library makes available.</p>

<p>Properly configured, proxy servers can act as "doormen"
ensuring that only authenticated users are allowed to pass.
Properly configuring proxy servers is becoming a campus-wide
security issue, however, and will definitely require much more
institutional focus in the coming year.</p>

<p>The expanding user demand for wireless access to library
systems and services also presents related database security
issues, not the least of which is authentication for valid Emory
affiliates. In the coming year we expect to continue collaborate
closely with our campus information technology division to
identify support and security issues and develop guidelines and
protocols which will equitably balance our users' desires for
easy access, any time and any where, with security and commercial
licensing requirements.</p>
