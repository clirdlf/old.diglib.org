<dd><b>Virginia Heritage Project</b><br>
UVA, representing VIVA (the Virtual Library of Virginia), was awarded $250,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to implement the Virginia Heritage Project.  The VHP has two primary goals.  The first goal is the creation of a large union database of EAD tagged finding aids to archival collections in Virginia.  The second goal is the development and implementation of a model for statewide dissemination of and training in newly emerging library standards and technologies.  The VHP is distinctive due to the collaborative efforts of over eleven separate institutions, each contributing to the database and training.  (Special Collections)<br>

<p>

<dd><b>Digital Library Repository update</b><br>
	The R&D group has begun to rigorously stress test the implementation using
software that simulates simultaneous users requesting a realistic mixture of different requests. On a Sun Ultra80 two-processor workstation, simulating 20 simultaneous users making requests with an average delay of 300 milliseconds, response time averages are approximately one half second per request. Note that for most of the XML object transactions this includes a server-side rendering of the XML into HTML, a relatively processor-intensive action. The process of moving the repository to a four-processor, dedicated server has begun.  This is where we will continue the testing. The plan is to start scaling the testbed up by duplicating the existing objects repeatedly, running the user tests at 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 objects. (Digital Library Research and Development)

<dd><b>WebCollector</b><br>
	The "WebCollector" tool is a Java application that may be used
	as an aid to collect and preserve existing scholarship published in
	HTML and incorporate it into a data repository.  (Digital Library Research and
	Development)

<dd><b>Library of Tomorrow Update</b><br>
After a five-month planning process, the Library released its Library of Tomorrow implementation plan.  Entitled "Preparing for our Future", this document calls for a new central digital production facility, new methods for acquiring and managing digital collections, the development of "information communities", and recommends the development of a series of Library produced information channels for the University portal system.  <br>

<p>

<dd><b>Teaching with Technology Experiment</b><br>
The Library and the University's central computing organization are partnering on an initiative to make it easy for faculty to acquire the skills needed to introduce technology in the classroom in support of teaching and learning.  Faculty will commit to training that will enable use of technology in teaching.  In exchange they will receive a full-configured laptop and support for implementing their individual proposal for teaching with technology.
<p>

<dd><b>Building an American Studies Information Community </b><br>
This project is funded by the Andrew Mellon Foundation. The project will focus on building the infrastructure for an information community by concentrating on collections and tools that are particularly useful to scholars and students studying American Culture.  Goals for the project include expanding our digital library testbed, developing a set of tools and procedures for an American Studies community, and developing the portal for that community. Work will center around building the appropriate collection in the new digital library system the Library is developing, starting with existing text, image, statistical and GIS collections.  Research will continue on how information technology can be used to support and enhance the effort to harvest and enrich metadata from collections that are bought or those that are acquired by harvesting Open Archive servers.
