Under the auspices of an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership Grant, the General Libraries and the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) completed a research and demonstration project, which began December 1999, including a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the usability of UT Library Online. The Grant, totaling $224,512, also supported the development of a set of tools and guidelines that libraries, museums, and other information agencies can use to improve the utility of their sites.  To date, UTLOL has received 68 million hits in 2001.<br>
