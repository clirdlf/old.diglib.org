                </b>Phase II of the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS) was
                completed in March 2001. The searchable APIS database now includes merged
                metadata records for papyri and ostraca in the six major U.S. university
                collections (Columbia, Berkeley, Duke, Michigan, Princeton and Yale) and
                provides links to more than 5600 unique, high quality digital images of
                documentary and literary papyri. &nbsp;The APIS online system provides
                real-time SQL database searching via the Web and includes translations,
                browsable listings of subjects and genre types and links to corresponding
                transliterations in the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (at Project
                Perseus). &nbsp;&nbsp;In April, NEH awarded another $300,000 grant for
                a Phase III of the project, which will focus on gathering and merging
                metadata and image links from additional U.S. university collections into
                the APIS database.<br>

                </b>Overlapping and extending the initial Mellon grant (which ran through
                December 2000), Digital Scriptorium is now funded by a grant from NEH
                (May 1999-June 2002, counting the third-year no-cost extension). &nbsp;The
                present number of participating institutions stands at twelve, although
                only those under the original Mellon grant have bibliographic/photographic
                data available on the web at this point.
                <p>Currently pending is an application for funds from the Delmas Foundation
                  so that we can develop higher quality searching and user interface;
                  this work will be based on the almost completed dtd for description

                </b>Columbia participates as a lead institution in the Digital South Asia
                Library (DSAL), a collaborative endeavor sponsored by the Center for Research
                Libraries with participation from leading U.S. universities, the Library
                of Congress, the Asia Society, the British Library, Oxford, Cambridge
                and a number of institutions in South Asia. Funding for 1999-2002 was
                provided by the U.S Department of Education under their grants for Technical
                Innovation &amp; Cooperation for Foreign Information Access, the Dharam
                Hinduja Indic Research Center, and other educational foundations. &nbsp;DSAL
                has created digital versions of South Asia print materials in the following
                categories: Reference Resources (dictionaries, pedagogical grammars),
                Images (historical and architectural photo archives &#151; about 300,000
                digital images to date), Maps, Statistics (historical statistical compilations,
                in e-book and spreadsheet formats), Bibliographic databases (catalogs
                to two major collections in India, article indexing, world union lists
                of newspaper holdings), and selected E-book and E-Journals.
                <p>
                  Columbia's ongoing DSAL collaboration with the University of Chicago
                  and the Triangle South Asia Consortium (NC) to create and disseminate
                  online dictionaries for twenty-six modern literary languages of South
                  Asia continues on schedule.&nbsp; Full digital data has been created
                  (through double-keying and automated error detection) for 12 dictionaries
                  so far, with another 5 in process right now. &nbsp;Negotations for digital
                  publishing rights for the remaining titles identified by the selection
                  committee are going forward now. &nbsp;A powerful user interface for
                  browsing, searching, and viewing dictionary entries has been devised,
                  and is in production mode on the website right now. &nbsp;The interface
                  for searching image metadata has also been completed.<br>

                site presenting architectural drawings and photographs by Charles and
                Henry Greene, American Arts and Crafts movement architects working in
                the early 20th century. &nbsp;Cataloging (in the form of archival finding
                aids) and images are being contributed by Columbia, Berkeley, and the
                Huntington Library; Berkeley is providing technical support for the metadata
                compilation and web presentation. &nbsp;All of Columbia's cataloging has
                been completed and digital imaging of the approximately 5000 slides, photographs
                and rotogravures will begin in the next few months. &nbsp;Images will
                be stored at and served from local institutions; MrSid compression technology
                will provide flexible image navigation and study potential.
                <p>At Columbia this project is seen as an operational test of the more
                  comprehensive larger &quot;Digital Aviador&quot; project which will
                  capture and present a comprehensive set of architectural drawings and
                  photographs from the collections of Avery Library. "Digital Aviador"
                  is the successor project to the original Avery/RLG Aviador videodisc
                  project completed in 1992.<br>

          <blockquote> <b><a name="ejournals"></a>EJournals Metadata Project<br>
                </b>As part of our overall effort to implement a database-driven approach
                to building the Library's web interface to electronic resources,Columbia's
                Ejournals Metadata Project has now implemented browsable lists of ejournals
                on our LibraryWeb site which are generated weekly from CLIO (Columbia's
                LMS).&nbsp; For ejournals not cataloged in CLIO, the Project will in the
                next phase provide a mechanism for distributed, selector/reference librarian
                input of preliminary or minimal-level ejournal metadata which will then
                be integrated and displayed as part of the catalog-derived ejournal listings.
                &nbsp;The Project's goal is to fully automate the publication to the Web
                of these listings &#151; initially, by title, publisher, society/sponsor
                and subject category, in the next phase, by geographic and other content.
                &nbsp;The Project also addresses the related task of creating &quot;permanent
                URLs&quot; for ejournals in Columbia's supported e-collections and provides
                an improved workflow for the systematic proxying of individual ejournal
                titles. &nbsp;When the Ejournals Metadata Project is complete, the same
                approach will be extended to other eresource formats such as databases,
                e-texts, etc.
                <p>The application is implemented using our <a href="#mmf"><u>Master Metadata
                  File</u></a>, the CUL <a href="#hilcc"><u>Hierarchical Interface to
                  LC Classification</u></a>, and our new <a href="#resolver"><u>Name Resolver</u></a>
                  application. &nbsp;Java and cgi scripting are used for MARC to MMF conversion
                  and HTML page generation. &nbsp;In a later phase, the current batch
                  web page creation will be supplemented or replaced by real-time database
                  retrieval and display.<br>

                  Columbia's Master Metadata File (MMF) &#151; a locally-developed metadata
                  repository using IBM's DB2 product and built around a MARC-based relational
                  database schema &#151; currently holds about 25,000 bibliographic and
                  structural metadata for digital collections held locally or accessed
                  remotely. &nbsp;The schema was designed to be able to represent multiple
                  versions, collections, aggregations such as pages in a book, and hierarchies
                  of digital objects. Information may be imported and exported in several
                  formats. &nbsp;The database also may be used as an intermediate architectural
                  component and may be queried interactively. </p>
                <p>Within the last few months the MMF has been brought into full production
                  for both the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/projects/digital/apis/index.html"><u>APIS
                  Project</u></a> and the <a href="#ejournals">Ejournals Metadata Project</a>.
                  In the first case metadata was obtained, converted and loaded from partner
                  institutions' local cataloging, creating a composite (&quot;union&quot;)
                  database at Columbia for papyrological materials which can be queried
                  in real time.&nbsp; In the second case, MARC cataloging data for ejournals
                  is extracted from our local LMS (CLIO) on an ongoing basis, converted
                  and loaded into the MMF.&nbsp; The next phase of this key strategic
                  project includes: a) development of robust and scalable real-time applications
                  running against the MMF; b) extension of the underlying schema to include
                  administrative metadata in order to build applications to support acquisition
                  and management of e-resources. &nbsp;We expect also to look at the new
                  METS structural metadata standard and evaluate the role it might play

                  Columbia's Hierarchical Interface to LC Classification (HILCC) project
                  is intended to test the potential of using the LC Classification numbers
                  provided in standard catalog records to generate a structured menuing
                  system for subject access on the web. &nbsp;The HILCC mapping table
                  &#151; being jointly developed by CUL systems, cataloging and reference
                  staff &#151; associates each LC classification range with vocabulary
                  in a three-level subject tree, for example:</p>
                <table width="475" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" bordercolor="#006699">
                  <tr>
                        <td align="right"><i>LC Range:</i></td>
                        <td>GC 1 - GC 1582 </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                        <td align="right"><i>Maps to:</i></td>

                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p> Call numbers from catalog records extracted from CLIO (Columbia's
                  LMS) are matched against the HILCC mapping table, and a browsable subject
                  category tree is generated on the web to guide users through eresource
                  subject content. &nbsp;HILCC has been used now for two web-based services
                  at Columbia: CLIO Notify and the Browsable Ejournal Subject Listings.
                  The next phase of this project will entail: a) testing and evaluation;
                  b) revising and extending current HILCC mapping; c) developing a strategy
                  for including interdisciplinary resources and other areas not easily
                  mapped to LC Classification; d) comparison with colleague institutions'
                  web-based subject taxonomies. <br>

                  </b>In late March, 27,364 MARC records for netLibrary books were loaded
                  into the Libraries' online catalog, CLIO. &nbsp;Under a consortial arrangement
                  including Cornell, Dartmouth, and Middlebury College, the full contents
                  of netLibrary are available to users at all four institutions. &nbsp;As
                  soon as a book has been checked out twice by users at any of the four,
                  it is purchased for the consortium, with funds coming from a deposit
                  account. &nbsp;This arrangement will be reevaluated each year, as we
                  gain more experience with use patterns.&nbsp; Having the records in
                  CLIO showed immediate results in dramatically increased use. &nbsp;Records
                  have been loaded in two sets, with separate markers for those books
                  that have been purchased by the consortium and those that are only available
                  for purchase through use. &nbsp;These markers will allow us to manage
                  future access should the terms of the arrangement change </p>
                <p><a name="resolver"></a><b>Name Resolver/URN Implementation<br>
                  </b>In Fall 2000 the Libraries implemented a name resolver application
                  which is now used for access to both licensed and free electronic resources
                  in our digital collections. &nbsp;The name resolver allows the creation
                  of persistent URLs (URNs) for display in the library's OPAC and in Web
                  presentations of electronic resources.&nbsp; Maintenance and updating
                  of actual e-resource URLs &amp; addresses are now handled by library
                  systems staff in special directory tables referenced by the name resolution
                  scripts, rather than in the library's catalog.</p>
                <p>As part of the name resolver's implementation, a one time global update
                  was done against the online catalog in order to add local 956 fields
                  (parallel to MARC 856 fields) containing URNs to all existing catalog
                  records for eresources.&nbsp; New and changed catalog records are now
                  identified on a weekly schedule and updated with 956 fields containing
                  URNs. &nbsp;&nbsp;The same process generates a data feed used to update
                  the actual name resolver tables and to flag resources that require &quot;proxying&quot;
                  and other types of authorization-related maintenance. &nbsp;A recent
                  enhancement to the system allows for real-time ad-hoc assignment of
                  URNs by non-library systems staff, e.g., when placing newly scanned
                  articles and folders on electronic reserve. &nbsp;Log records are created
                  for all name resolver transactions and will be used as a way of gathering
                  more complete &amp; consistent statistics on the use of licensed commercial
                  web resources by the Columbia community.<br>

                          Columbia and elsewhere have yielded valuable information concerning
                          the best technologies, tools and processes for creating these resources,

                        </b>As a public service unit, the Electronic Text Service has continued
                        to focus its primary effort on developing and providing access to
                        the libraries' digital text holdings in the humanities and history,
                        maintaining areas of traditional strength, such as Classics, Medieval

                        first Web finding tool in the field (1994), now provides direct, Web-enabled
                        download of dataset files, along with all available documentation
                        and programs.&nbsp; Under the leadership of Jane Weintrop, the new
                        Data Resources Librarian, delivery and preparations for supporting
                        the 2000 Census, in all its permutations, are underway. &nbsp;Nearly

                        direct data access twenty-four hours a day will be a focus of EDS
                        efforts in the future. &nbsp;In the coming year, EDS will also host

                        The BorrowDirect Project&#151;a collaborative effort by Columbia University,
                        the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, and RLG&#151;will
                        move to a new phase in July 2001. &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally called the
                        &quot;CoPY Project,&quot; BorrowDirect's objective was to test whether
                        using specified &quot;lenders of first resort&quot; could substantially
                        lower the unit cost of traditional interlibrary loan while maintaining
                        high service standards. &nbsp;With more than 4,000 requests filled
                        during the first 18 months, the project demonstrated a cost-effective
                        alternative to traditional ILL, with better service for its users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        With the end of the pilot phase, the three university libraries will
                        take over project coordination from RLG and work collaborative to
                        extend and improve the service.
                  <p>BorrowDirect allows patrons to access a &quot;virtual catalog&quot;
                        that combines the collections of Columbia, Penn, and Yale. &nbsp;Users
                        initiate a request for a known citation that is searched across the
                        three catalogs using Z39.50 broadcast searching. &nbsp;A customized
                        software package lets user requests bypass the borrowing library's
                        ILL office and go directly to the potential lending location. &nbsp;Links
                        to each library's data files authenticate the patron, check the circulation
                        status, and determine the availability of the requested item. Automatic
                        e-mail to the patron confirms the request and additional e-mails are
                        sent as the request progresses.&nbsp; The libraries use a commercial
                        overnight delivery service to enable a four-working-day turnaround
                        from the initial request to notification of pickup availability.</p>
