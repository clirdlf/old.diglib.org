      <blockquote>On May 1, 1995, 16 institutions created the Digital Library Federation (additional partners have since joined the original
         16). The DLF partners have committed themselves to "bring together -- from across the nation and beyond -- digitized materials
         that will be made accessible to students, scholars, and citizens everywhere." If they are to succeed in reaching their goals,
         all DLF participants realize that they must act quickly to build the infrastructure and the institutional capacity to sustain
         digital libraries. In support of DLF participants' efforts to these ends, DLF launched this publication series in 1999 to
         highlight and disseminate critical work.

         <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>The Making of America Testbed Project, coordinated by the Digital Library Federation (DLF), is a multiphase endeavor. Its
         purpose is to investigate important issues in the creation of an integrated but distributed digital library of archival materials
         (that is, digitized surrogates of primary source materials found in archives and special collections). Drafted during the
         MoA II planning phase, this report identifies a starting point for the testbed that is being created in the production phase
         of this project, which is funded by the National Endowment for Humanities.
      </p>
      
      <p>The library community has a distinguished history of developing standards to enhance the discovery and sharing of print materials:
         they include, for example, MARC, Z39.50,<b> </b>and interlibrary loan protocols. This leadership continues today, as libraries create new best practices and standards that
         address digital collections and content issues. The primary goal of this report is to open a dialogue about digital library
         standards, specifically, to discuss any new best practices and standards that will be required to enable the digital library
         to meet traditional collection, preservation, and access objectives.
      </p>
      
      <p>This report asks the question, "How can we create integrated digital library services that operate across multiple, distributed
         repositories?" Existing standards and best practices clearly play an important role in answering this question. However, this
         report and the MoA II Testbed Project raise a new area of discussion that goes beyond the discovery of a digital object and
         address how it is handled. The report and the testbed focus on the need to develop standards for creating and encoding digital
         representations of archival objects (for example, a digitized photograph or a digital representation of a book or diary).
         If tools are to be developed that work with digitized archival objects across distributed repositories, these objects will
         require some form of standardization.
      </p>
      
      <p>This report begins the discussion of digital object definitions by developing and examining metadata standards for digital
         representations of a variety of archival objects, including text, digitized page images, photographs, and other forms. For
         the purposes of this report, there are three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative<i>.</i> Descriptive metadata are used to discover the object. A researcher may use descriptive metadata to limit a search by title
         and author in an OPAC or other database. Structural metadata define the object's internal organization and are needed for
         display and navigation of that object. For instance, structural metadata may contain information about the number of pages
         an object contains and what order they should be viewed in. Administrative metadata contain
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-2-</i></p>
         
         the management information needed to keep the object over time and to identify artifacts that might have been introduced during
         its production and management. For example, administrative metadata indicate when the object was digitized, at what resolution,
         and who can access it.
      </p>
      
      <p>The project testbed proposes to use existing descriptive metadata standards, such as MARC records and the Dublin Core, as
         well as standards that incorporate both descriptive and structural metadata, such as the Encoded Archival Description (EAD),
         to help the user locate a particular digital object. This report proposes defining new standards for the structural and administrative
         metadata needed to view and manage digital objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>At a higher level, the report proposes a Digital Library Service Model in which services are based on tools that work with
         the digital objects from distributed repositories. This approach borrows from the popular object-oriented design model. It
         defines a digital object as encapsulating content, metadata, and methods. <i>Methods</i> are program code segments that allow the object to perform services for tools (for example "Get the next page of this digital
         diary"). Unlike other models, the Digital Library Service Model includes methods as part of the object.
      </p>
      
      <p>The report also identifies several archival digital object classes that are being examined as part of the MoA II project,
         including photographs, photograph albums, diaries, journals, letterpress books, ledgers, and correspondence. One of the objectives
         for the testbed is to develop the tools that display and navigate these MoA II objects, some of which have complex internal
         organization. Therefore, another goal of this report is to identify the structural metadata elements that are needed to support
         display and navigation and ensure that they are included as part of the digital objects. Finally, this report begins to examine
         the methods (program code) that could be included with each class of object.
      </p>
      
      <p>After the library and archival communities have reviewed this report, MoA II participants will incorporate reader feedback
         into the development of digital object definitions for the classes of materials to be examined in the MoA II testbed. These
         definitions will specify how to encode the content, metadata, and methods as part of the object. An important goal of the
         project is to use the testbed to investigate the advantages and limitations of these definitions and stimulate discussion
         of standards for digital library objects and best practices for digitizing archival materials. This discussion must include
         the project participants, DLF members, and representatives of the wider community. In addition, the project will contribute
         to the DLF Architecture Committee's ongoing discussion of distributed system architectures for digital libraries. The MoA
         II testbed will give the library and archival communities a tool they can use to test, evaluate, and refine digital library
         object definitions and digitization practices. It is expected that these discussions will move the archival and library communities
         closer to a consensus on standards and best practices in these areas.

         <h2>PART I: PROJECT BACKGROUND</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>In 1998, the DLF, working with staff of the University of California (UC) at Berkeley, developed a grant proposal that requested
         support to create a testbed for its Making of America II project. The objective of the testbed was to move the DLF members
         and the wider library and archival communities closer to the realization of a national digital library by addressing several
         issues that are critical to this goal.
      </p>
      
      <p>UC Berkeley submitted the proposal to the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), which awarded funding. The proposed
         project team included individuals associated with UC-Berkeley and four other DLF member institutions: Cornell University,
         the New York Public Library, Pennsylvania State University, and Stanford University.
      </p>
      
      <p>As described in the proposal, the MoA II testbed is designed to provide a means for the DLF to investigate, refine, and recommend
         metadata elements and encodings used to discover, display, and navigate digital archival objects. The DLF expects that the
         MoA II testbed will generate a working system for investigating metadata problems and for discussing, testing, and refining
         different solutions. The project will give DLF members information that can be used to create the necessary standards or recommendations
         for best practices for each research area. The project will also be of value to the library and archival communities as a
         whole because it will advance discussion of the nature of the digital library and move libraries toward a consensus.
      </p>
      
      <p>The project has three phases: planning, research and production, and dissemination. The planning phase was funded by the DLF.
         During the research and production phase, which is funded by the NEH and is currently under way, theories developed in the
         planning phase are being tested. In the dissemination phase, the project will share its tested ideas and practices<b> </b>with the broader community.
      </p>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Planning Phase (October 1997-May 1998)</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Participants in the planning phase decided that the MoA II Testbed Project must engage scholars, archivists, and librarians
         interested in access to the digital materials represented in the project, as well as metadata and technical experts. The following
         four activities were recommended:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>UC Berkeley would work with representatives from Cornell, the New York Public Library, Penn State, and Stanford, and with
               consultants and selected archivists, to review the collections proposed for conversion and identify the classes of digital
               archival objects to be represented in the testbed. The classes could include formats such as correspondence, photographs,
               diaries, and ledgers. (The MoA II Steering Committee recommended before the start of the project that books and serial articles
               be considered outside the scope of this project.)
            </li>
            
            <li>UC Berkeley, working with the same group, would draft a paper that identified the behaviors of each class of digital objects
               and
               
               
               <hr width="75%">
               <p align="center"><i>-4-</i></p>
               
               the structural and administrative metadata to support those behaviors. In addition, the paper would suggest initial best practices
               for digitizing the classes of archival objects to be included in the project. Finally, it would include a compilation of existing
               work in these areas as well as any original contributions the group could provide.
            </li>
            
            <li>The participants in the MoA II Testbed Project and the DLF Architecture Committee would review the draft paper. It would then
               be revised and distributed to the wider community for review.
            </li>
            
            <li>Technical experts at UC Berkeley would analyze the paper and design a means of encoding the behaviors, metadata, and objects
               for implementation during the research and production phase of the project.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Research and Production Phase (May 1998-March 2000)</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The MoA II testbed would be used to investigate, refine, and enhance the working definitions of administrative and structural
         metadata, and the important behaviors of archival objects. The testbed project has the following goals, defined during the
         planning phase:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>to create tools that help the library community understand how digital archival objects are discovered, displaye, and navigated;</li>
            
            <li>to understand how these tools use metadata and what value the metadata provide and at what cost; and</li>
            
            <li>to give the DLF a set of metadata practices that can be reviewed and recommended to the wider community.</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Dissemination Phase (Summer 2000)</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>When the research and production phase has ended, the MoA II Testbed Project will seek funding for an invitational seminar
         at which project results will be reviewed. Participants will include digital library experts, archivists and special collections
         librarians, scholars, computer scientists, museum professionals, and others who have participated in developing the EAD protocols,
         are engaged in similar work, or have appropriate expertise. At the end of this phase, project results will be disseminated,
         practices established will be refined, as necessary, and an agenda for further community review will be formulated.

         <h2>PART II: THE MOA II DIGITAL LIBRARY SERVICE MODEL</h2>
      </center>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Overview</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The digital library service model developed for the MoA II Testbed Project has three layers: services, tools, and digital
         library objects (fig. 1). In this model, services are provided through tools that discover, display, navigate, and manipulate
         digital objects from distributed repositories.
      </p>
      
      <p>This report also proposes a digital object model that fits within the service model. The object model defines digital objects,
         which are the foundation of the service model, as an encapsulation of content, metadata, and methods.
      </p>
      
      <p>Each of the layers in the model may be described as follows.</p>
      
      <h4>Services Layer</h4>
      
      <p>This layer describes the services to be provided for a specific group of users. Because the MoA II Testbed Project relates
         to scholars' use of archival materials, these services could include the discovery, display, navigation, and manipulation
         of digital surrogates made from these collections. The specific service model used in this project follows the standard archival
         model; that is, materials can be discovered via USMARC collection-level records in a catalog. The catalog records can link
         the user to the related finding aid that describes the collection in more detail, and the finding aids can link to individual
         digitized archival materials.
      </p>
      
      <p>The services layer contains a suite of tools to support the needs of a particular group of users. For example, scholars would
         be comfortable using sophisticated electronic finding aids to locate and view digital archival materials such as photographs
         or diaries. However, fifth-graders, with less rigorous information needs, may require simpler tools to discover and view these
         items.
      </p>

      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-6-</i></p>
      
      
      <h4>Tools Layer</h4>
      
      <p>This layer contains the tools that serve the user. The MoA II tools consist of the following:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>an online catalog for the discovery and display of the USMARC collection-level records;</li>
            
            <li>a standard generalized markup language (SGML)-compliant database that will be used to search, display, and navigate the EAD-compliant
               electronic finding aids; and
            </li>
            
            <li>tools to display and navigate the MoA II-compliant digital archival objects. (Objects are MoA II-compliant when they can be
               delivered using the proposed encoding standards described later in this paper.)
            </li>
            
         </ul> Any tool is actually a suite of behaviors, or actions. With a digital diary, for example, such behaviors could include actions
         such as "Turn to the next page," "Go to the previous page," "Jump to Chapter 3," or "Translate this page into French."
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Digital Library Objects Layer</h4>
      
      <p>This layer contains the actual digital objects that populate distributed network repositories. Objects of the same class share
         encoding standards that encapsulate (that is, include) their content, metadata, and methods. Separate classes of digital objects
         could be defined for books, continuous-tone photographs, diaries, and other objects.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>A Model for Digital Library Objects</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Digital library objects form the foundation of the digital library service model. It is now possible to create a digital object
         model for these objects that will fit within the overall service model.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Adding Classes and Content to the MoA II Object Model</h4>
      
      <p>The MoA II object model defines classes of digital archival objects (for example, diaries, journals, photographs, and correspondence).
         Each object in a given class has content that is a digital representation of a particular item. The content can be digitized
         page images, ASCII text, numeric data sets, and other formats. The following are examples of three classes of archival objects
         and their content format:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>a photograph made up of a single digitized tagged image file format (TIFF) image</li>
            
            <li>a photo album made up of 30 photograph objects</li>
            
            <li>a diary made up of 200 digitized TIFF page images and textual transcriptions</li>
            
         </ul> The object model starts by defining classes of archival objects in a system under which each object has content that is an
         electronic
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-7-</i></p>
         
         representation of a particular archival item of that class.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Adding Metadata to the MoA II Object Model</h4>
      
      <p>For the purposes of this discussion, metadata are considered as separate from content. Metadata are data that in some manner
         describe the content. The DLF systems architecture committee has identified three types of metadata:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>Descriptive metadata are used in the discovery and identification of an object. Examples include MARC and Dublin Core records.</li>
            
            <li>Structural metadata are used to display and navigate a particular object for a user. They include information on the internal
               organization of an object.<a href="#p2n1"> [1]</a> For example, a given diary has three volumes. Volume I has two sections: dated entries and accounts. The dated entries section
               has 200 entries; entry 20 is dated August 4, 1890, and starts on page 50 of Volume I.
            </li>
            
            <li>Administrative metadata represent the management information for the object, including the date it was created, its content
               file format, and rights information.
            </li>
            
         </ul> Metadata can now be added to the model. Any class of archival object encapsulates both content and metadata, where the metadata
         are used to discover, display, navigate, manipulate, and learn more about a particular object's management information.
      </p>
      
      <p>The distinction among the three types of metadata is not absolute. For example, chapters are part of the structure of a book,
         but chapter headings may be indexed to aid in the discovery of the item, thus filling one of the roles of descriptive metadata.
         In fact, the text of a book itself could be indexed and used for discovery.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Adding Methods to the MoA II Object Model</h4>
      
      <p>Several concepts used in this paper, including method<i>s</i>, originate from object-oriented design (OOD).
      </p>
      
      <h4>Object-Oriented Design as Part of the Object Model</h4>
      
      <p>The popularity of OOD is evident in the widespread use of related programming languages such as C++ and Java. Some of the
         reasons for this popularity also make OOD an attractive addition to the digital library service model. In particular, OOD
         actually models users' behaviors, making it easier to more accurately translate their needs
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-8-</i></p>
         
         into system applications. This advantage will be discussed in more detail later.
      </p>
      
      <p>Object-oriented design has another important advantage. In OOD, a digital object conceptually encapsulates<i> </i>both content and methods. <i>Methods</i> are program code segments that allow an object to perform services for tools. These methods are part of the object and can
         be used by developers to interact with the content. For example, a developer can ask a digital book object named Book1 for
         page 25 by executing that object's <i>get_page() </i>method and specifying page 25. This method call may look something like <i>Book1.get_page(25).</i></p>
      
      <p>The most important advantage of making methods part of the object may be that these basic program segments do not then have
         to be reinvented by every developer.<a href="#p2n2"> [2]</a> Instead, the developer can have the tool ask the object's existing method to perform the needed work. This makes the development
         of new tools faster and easier. Since tools directly support the end user in this model, their development should be encouraged.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Defining the Difference between Behaviors and Methods</h4>
      
      <p>One great advantage of the object-oriented design approach is that it models users' behavior with methods. There is a clear
         distinction between user-level <i>behaviors</i> and <i>methods</i>. The word <i>behaviors</i> relates to how users describe what tools can do for them. For example, "Zoom in on this area of a photograph," "Show me this
         diary," "Display the next page of this book," or "Translate this page into French." The word <i>methods</i> refers to how system designers describe what tools can do for a user.
      </p>
      
      <p>One important reason for distinguishing between behaviors and methods is to establish a process that will enable libraries
         to engage their users in a dialogue about what services and tools they require, down to the behaviors they need in each tool.
         Software engineers can then map the user behaviors into sets of methods that are required to perform the necessary functions.
         The line between behaviors and methods represents the transition from user requirements to system design.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following examples of user-level behaviors might be relevant an to item in the digital library class "diary":
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>"Show me the organization of this diary." (It may have three volumes, each of which includes sections on dated entries, accounts,
               and quotes.)
            </li>
            
            <li>"Show me the first page of Volume 1."</li>
            
            <li>&gt;"Show me page 3, the next page, or the previous page."</li>
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>-9-</i></p>
            
            
            <li>"Show me the fourth journal entry."</li>
            
            <li>"Show me the first entry for August 1890."</li>
            
            <li>"Show me more entries on the same topic."</li>
            
            <li>"Show me entries that are separated by gaps of more than 10 days."</li>
            
            <li>"Show me entries that have these words in them."</li>
            
            <li>"Bookmark this entry."</li>
            
            <li>"Annotate this entry."</li>
            
            <li>"Share these entries with my colleagues."</li>
            
         </ul> In each case, these user-level behaviors would have to be mapped into a series of methods that perform the behavior.
      </p>
      
      <p>A short example may help illustrate the mapping that occurs between behaviors and methods. Imagine a user-level behavior that
         is described as "Show me this diary." The tool executing this request could use object methods to (1) fetch the table of contents
         and (2) fetch the first page of the diary. The tool would then use its own methods to display the table in one browser frame
         and the first page in another frame.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Methods as Part of the MoA II Digital Object Model</h4>
      
      <p>Methods now become part of the object model. At this point, it is important to note the close relationship between methods
         and metadata. In most cases, the methods require that appropriate metadata be present.<a href="#p2n3"> [3]</a></p>
      
      <p>The MoA II object model includes methods that are conceptually encapsulated, along with content and metadata, within an object
         of any given class, where the methods are used by tools to retrieve, store, or manipulate that object's content. Methods often
         need the object's metadata to perform their functions.

         <h3>Building MoA II Archival Objects</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The final step in building a digital library object is to encapsulate the methods, metadata, and content (data) into a digital
         library object.<a href="#p2n4"> [4]</a> The metadata and content must be encoded in a standard manner for objects in a given class. This encoding is required so
         that the methods defined for each class can work across all objects in that class.

         <h3>Summary</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>This report proposes a digital library service model for the MoA II Testbed Project in which services are based on tools that
         work with the digital objects from distributed repositories. This model recommends that libraries begin by defining the services
         they need to provide for each audience they support. Next, they must define the tools needed to implement these services.
         This process should include the identification of user-level behaviors for the tools, that is, what the tools do as required
         by the users. This report also proposes a digital object model that fits within the overall service model. The object model
         describes digital objectsthe foundation of the service modelas an encapsulation of content, metadata, and methods. Different
         classes of objects exist (for example, diary or photograph), and the content of each object may be text, digitized page images,
         photographs, or another format. The object also contains metadata of three types: (1) descriptive metadata used to discover
         the object; (2)<i> </i>structural metadata<i> </i>that define the object's internal organization and are needed for display and navigation of that object; and (3) administrative
         metadata that contain management information (such as the date the object was digitized, at what resolution, and who can access
         it). The digital object definition borrows from the popular OOD model and includes methods as part of the object. Methods
         are program code segments that allow the object to perform services for tools.

      <p><a name="p2n1"></a><p>1. Structural metadata exist in various levels of complexity. The diary example above represents a rich structure that may
            be created for an important work and would include a transcription of the digitized handwritten pages. The structure of the
            diary could be encoded in this transcription, and the structural metadata could be extracted from it. At the other extreme,
            a diary could exist with only enough structural metadata to turn the pages.
         </p><br><br></p>
      
      <p><a name="p2n2"></a><p>2. This digital object model is only conceptual. Complete objects made up of metadata, data, and methods do not sit in a repository
            waiting for use. Instead, they are created as needed. That is, the parts of the objects (methods, metadata, and content) are
            assembled from different areas of persistent store located anywhere on the network. Using the object-oriented model does not
            require a repository to use specific object technologies such as object-oriented databases. Relational databases, for example,
            could be used for the persistent storage.
         </p><br><br></p>
      
      <p><a name="p2n3"></a><p>3. The methods that are part of an object tend to be those that are most used across sets of tools. Tools themselves will
            have methods and therefore will need access to the metadata and content of the objects. Project staff expect that every object
            will have a base set of methods that can provide the tools with any metadata or content that is required.
         </p><br><br></p>
      
      <p><a name="p2n4"></a><p>4. While the content and metadata must be encoded in a standard manner, they do not necessarily have to be stored together
            nor do the three different types of metadata need to reside together because objects only come into existence as needed. Therefore,
            the object can be assembled virtually from persistent storage when required.

         <h2>PART III: IMPLEMENTING THE MOA II SERVICE MODEL</h2>
      </center>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Selecting Digital Archival Classes</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Project staff selected a group of object types and classes from the materials suggested by institutions participating in the
         MoA II project. These archival object types are the core of those examined in this project. The number of items selected was
         limited to facilitate completion of the testbed within the project time frame.
      </p>
      
      <p>The object types and classes selected were as follows:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li><b>Continuous-tone photographs</b>: Single archival object. The photograph may have a caption or other textual information recorded on its face or on verso.
               Continuous-tone photographs are interesting for this project because they exist in abundance in many of the collections and
               because they enable a close look at the collection of administrative metadata for use in object behaviors. The most basic
               of objects, the continuous-tone photograph provides a solid platform upon which to base the project.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Photograph albums</b>: Bound manuscript object containing a collection of continuous-tone photographs. The photograph album may contain captions
               that are separate from the photographs or other items such as newspaper clippings. Photograph albums are a logical extension
               of continuous-tone photographs, since they contain photographs that are ordered in a structured manner and that raise both
               structural and administrative metadata issues.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Diaries, journals, and letterpress books</b>: Bound manuscript objects, usually arranged chronologically and with date notations. May have additional structure (for example,
               an "accounts" section noted in the back). These structured documents have the further possibility of additional metadata in
               the form of partial text (dates and other markers) included for additional navigation. With the inclusion of full texts, such
               as the William Henry Jackson diaries at the New York Public Library, full searching and navigation are possible.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Ledgers</b>: Bound manuscript objects that contain accounting records. They are usually arranged by account although sometimes they are
               in chronological order. The structure of documents of this sort is different from that of diaries and journals; however, in
               terms of structure and navigation, they may be considered a variation on a theme rather than a different object type. For
               these objects, inclusion of more text, while costly, allows for more sophisticated searching and navigation.
            </li>
            
            <li><b>Correspondence</b>: Objects of this class may be simple (a one-page letter) or complex (a long letter with an envelope and enclosures). Investigating
               correspondence allows the project to examine these sometimes-complicated documents and the structural metadata relationships
               between the subdocuments (letter to envelope, for example).
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         These types of materials have been selected for the testbed because the participating institutions hold large quantities of
         them or
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-12-</i></p>
         
         because they offer the project important challenges in terms of the behaviors needed to view, navigate, or manipulate them.
         The complex structure of photograph albums, for example, requires that users be able to see individual photographs, a photograph
         with its caption, photographs and captions in the context of pages, and pages in the context of an entire album. With diaries
         and journals, users may want to see individual entries or to jump from one entry to another or from an index to an entry.
         Diaries and journals also raise the issue of individual page scans that do not correspond with the logical structure of the
         document. For example, entries frequently end in the middle of a page and a new entry begins on that same page. In addition,
         when different levels of metadata are available, these materials allow for display and navigation experiments. For example,
         a minimal digital diary might consist of a series of page images with only a base set of behaviors that can be implemented
         (for example, "turn to the next page"). A richer digital diary may have encoded text transcribed that allows for a variety
         of tool behaviors for each page image. For example, the tools could display a table of contents for the diary, jump to a particular
         page or entry, or search for text strings. The structure of letterpress books and ledgers offers the potential for interaction
         between indexes in a document and its individual entries or parts. The project is also exploring how the structure of these
         items differs from those of diaries and journals. While ledgers, letterpress books, journals, and diaries are different classes
         from an archivist's point of view, they may be quite similar from a structural metadata perspective.
      </p>
      
      <p>The MoA II testbed will give participants and the broader archival and library communities a chance to evaluate different
         practices for encoding the relationships among objects. In particular, it will help the community understand the advantages
         and drawbacks of using these practices based on how tools implement different behaviors for each practice. For example, a
         series of correspondence could be scanned and:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>placed into a single base object;</li>
            
            <li>created as separate objects (one for each letter) and linked through the creation of a new aggregate collection;</li>
            
            <li>created as separate objects inside an embedded collection (folder) object. A collection object has metadata for the collection,
               followed by the embedded objects, each with its own metadata and content. This approach differs from item 2 in that the objects
               are embedded rather than linked; or
            </li>
            
            <li>organized through a finding aid in which the container list points to any of the above.</li>
            
         </ul> Each base object, whether it stands by itself or is part of an aggregation or embedded collection object, can be divided
         into sections by text encoding. For example, a diary can have dated entries identified by the text encoding that can be used
         for display and navigation. In the same manner, any type of object may also be a compound object
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-13-</i></p>
         
         through linking to other objects or embedding other objects inside itself.
      </p>
      
      <p>While the concepts of compound, linked, and embedded objects are not new, the MoA II testbed will give archivists and librarians
         a tool with which to better evaluate options for digital archival objects, particularly in the context of distributed repositories.
         The MoA II testbed will give the DLF and the wider community an opportunity to create objects using all the practices listed
         above. It will also allow for the evaluation of each practice to identify how tools can best use each practice to meet audience
         needs.

         <h3>MoA II Testbed Services and Tools</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The digital library service model described in Part II of this report is a three-tier model consisting of services, tools,
         and digital objects. The MoA II testbed is implementing the standard archival model within the digital library service model.
         That is, USMARC collection-level records in a catalog will link to their related finding aids, which will link to the digital
         archival objects in that collection.
      </p>
      
      <p>The top tier in the model (see fig. 1) is a services layer composed of suites of tools that focus on supporting particular
         groups of users (such as scholars, undergraduates, or K-12 students). An archivist, for example, would require different tools
         for the discovery, display, navigation, and manipulation of digital archival objects than would a fourth-grade student. Initially,
         the MoA II Testbed Project is focusing on general services for scholars who are using the classes of digital objects selected
         for the project. Future research projects could include developing service models for novice users or customized services
         for specialized scholars (such as what is envisioned for the Digital Scriptorium Project).
      </p>
      
      <p>The suite of tools to be developed in the MoA II testbed will initially include the following:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>an online catalog (OCLC's SiteSearch) used to discover and display the USMARC collection-level records;</li>
            
            <li>an SGML-compliant database (INSO's DynaWeb) used to search, display, and navigate the electronic finding aids that are compliant
               with the EAD; and
            </li>
            
            <li>display and navigation tools to be used with MoA II-compliant digitized photographs, photograph albums, diaries, journals,
               and correspondence. As the project entered the production year, project staff consulted various parties (including archivists,
               scholars, and librarians) to understand the behaviors required in this tool set.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>

         <h3>Behaviors and Methods"What Tools Do"</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Part II of this paper introduced the concepts of behaviors and methods in the context of object-oriented design. This section
         outlines those concepts in detail.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Definitions</h4>
      
      <p>The digital library service model defines <i>behaviors</i> as the ways in which users describe what tools do for them. Engaging users in a dialogue about behaviors can help identify
         user needs in terms of the functions performed by tools. System designers can then map these user-level behaviors into <i>methods</i>defined as discrete segments of program code that execute operations for tools. The translation from behaviors to methods
         represents the transition from defining user needs to system design. In many cases, high-level methods in a tool have the
         same name as a user-level behavior. The ability to create methods that model a user's desired behaviors is one of the strengths
         of object-oriented design.
      </p>
      
      <p>This definition of methods will be applied to specify the range of activities that should be supported through the metadata
         described elsewhere in this paper. In an object-oriented model, the methods are embedded in the digital objects; digital objects
         reveal methods to tools interacting with them. Many repositories in the MoA II environment will not deploy object-oriented
         models; in this case, the methods will be made available to tools that interact with repositories, rather than with the digital
         objects themselves. Nevertheless, this model is likely to be helpful both in conceptualizing the nature of the tasks supported
         and in preparing for a type of digital library that may scale more effectively than current architectures.
      </p>
      
      <p>The digital library should support methods that both common and exceptional operations users expect to perform with the digital
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-15-</i></p>
         
         objects. For an image collection, a method might be facilitating a pan or zoom on a portion of an image or providing an enlargement
         of an image. For an encoded diary, the method might involve providing the tool information about levels and types of organization
         (such as "One volume, including 128 dated entries, an itinerary, and a list of contacts with addresses"). The encoded diary's
         methods might also yield both simple (<i>next entry</i>, <i>previous entry</i>) and complex navigation (for example, "Locate the first dated entry in November 1884;" "Find entries where dates are separated
         by more than 10 days"). Although no object or repository would be required to support the full range of methods, the model
         proposed here will facilitate the development of increasingly sophisticated tools that can be scaled for use on a growing
         body of complex archival objects.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Contexts and Constraints</h4>
      
      <p>The methods of the digital library reside in tools that may be client-based or server-based, depending on the state of technology.
         The location of that method (that is, with the client or server) may shift with changes in technology. For example, widespread
         adoption of an image client that supports progressive transmission of image data might shift image processing from server
         to client, thereby expediting the processing and reducing the load on the server. However, an interim measure might rely on
         a server-based compression-decompression process in which the server can generate pan or zoom views at the user's request
         in real time. This relieves the client of processing responsibility and shifts the work to the server.
      </p>
      
      <p>Just as the methods may move from client to server and back again, they will also separate into specialized functions or merge
         into high-level, multifaceted functions. For example, <i>print </i>and <i>display</i> might be different methods, with one object optimized for screen display and another optimized for printing. In Adobe Acrobat,
         for instance, <i>display</i> and <i>print</i> are merged in the same tool. If it is argued that Acrobat handles <i>display </i>poorly, a clearer separation of these two methods might be advisable. By separating the methods conceptually, it is possible
         to assess the applicability of the tool in the service of the method.
      </p>
      
      <p>High-level methods frequently consist of a series of calls to lower-level methods. For example, because <i>print</i> is a behavior that most users require in a tool, most tools will have a high-level method expressed something like "print(a1,a2aN)."
         The information inside the parentheses represents arguments that tell the method what object to print, which printer to use,
         and so on. The <i>print</i> method would execute a series of lower-level methods. It may, for example, ask an object to deliver its content in a format
         suitable for printing by executing the proper method. Next, it may execute an operating system-specific method that sends
         (spools) the formatted content to that particular printer.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some methods are applicable to all or most objects, while others may need to be finely tailored to the type of objectso finely
         tailored,
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-16-</i></p>
         
         in fact, that they rely on entirely different functions or primatives. An obvious example is the difference between navigation
         of pages and navigation of portions of an image. A system that navigates a bound book might use operations such as "Display
         next page" or "Show page list." A system that navigates a continuous-tone image might use operations such as "Display 200
         by 200 pixels centered on coordinates X by Y."
      </p>
      
      <p>The following sections define methods that are central to creating the digital library. When possible, the descriptions are
         sufficiently generic to apply to a variety of objects; in some cases, the methods described are specific to some data types.<a href="#p3n5"> [5]</a></p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      
      <h4>General Navigation</h4>
      
      <p>Navigation consists of a request, a receive, and a display action. Each action interacts with a reference to objects or metadata
         for objects rather than to the objects themselves. A significant portion of the user's activity is navigation. For example,
         the user who finds a digital scrapbook in a repository may request a table of contents. Depending on the extent to which the
         book was processed, that table of contents may consist only of a stream of page references or of a nested list of chapter
         and section headings. In navigating the scrapbook, the user's navigation tool will
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>request<b> </b>references (to pages listed by page number or to sections listed by section headings);
            </li>
            
            <li>receive the references in a discernible format; and</li>
            
            <li>display that information in a way that is meaningful for the user.</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>The user expects a series of references, not actual delivery of the objects, which will not be sent until requested.</p>
      
      <p>Navigation also depends on an understanding of relationship primitives<i>parent</i>, <i>child</i>, and <i>sibling</i>that are the generic references a tool uses to facilitate navigation. The navigation method is affected by the tool requesting,
         receiving, and displaying the parents, children, or siblings of an object that the user has located. For example, to navigate
         a fully encoded and logically organized scrapbook, a navigation tool might request references to the first-level children
         in the scrapbook. A user would be presented with a list that looked like the following:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>dated entries</li>
            
            <li>accounting/budgetary data</li>
            
            <li>names and addresses</li>
            
            <li>itinerary</li>
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-17-</i></p>
         
         Each major heading may be presented as a link for further expansion, perhaps offering second-level headings to the user (for
         example, annual groupings of entries in the <i>dated entries</i> section). A threshold setting in the navigation tool may instruct the repository to send no more than <i>N</i> references at a time. The repository would make a determination that, for example, all first-level and second-level headings
         fit within the threshold (providing the annual groupings within the dated entries section at the same time it provides the
         four major headings listed above). At some point, the children of a given parent will be links to the objects themselves.
         In the scrapbook example cited earlier, the user could be presented with a navigation list of dated entries, any of which
         could be selected for display. Types of object references vary, depending on the type of resources, the amount of funding
         available to process the materials, and the programmatic or other purposes of an initiative. Examples include conceptual and
         structural references (as in the scrapbook example), simple page lists (such as Project Open Book and the University of Michigan
         Making of America sites), and pages of thumbnail representations of larger format images.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Image Navigation</h4>
      
      <p>In contrast to the generic form of navigation just discussed, image navigation uses image-specific information. Systems that
         display image information need information analogous to that used in geographic references; for example, X and Y coordinates,
         along with dimensions of the portion of the image to be displayed. Increasingly, tools for image management and manipulation
         use segmentation to optimize the relatively confined space of a video display as well as other resources in short supply (such
         as network capacity, memory, and CPU capacity). Some of these technologies are primarily server based, while others shift
         responsibility to the client. Wavelet compression, for example, allows a repository to store an extremely high-resolution
         image and generate lower-resolution versions and subsets in real time, at the request of the user or an intermediary. Another
         approach, implicit in tools or formats such as JPEG Tiled Image Pyramid (JTIP), segments the image into overlapping tiles
         in a pyramidal structure and allows the user to pan and zoom on a full-resolution image by requesting the next tile or a corresponding
         tile at a higher resolution. The image-navigation tool receives information about resolutions, resolution ratios, and window
         sizes to make the navigation possible; the image display tool uses that information to pan, zoom, crop, or otherwise use images.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Display and Print</h4>
      
      <p>The display method uses a reference to a known object to deliver an item to a screen-oriented tool, such as a graphical Web
         browser. In contrast to navigation, where the user tool requests object references, the display tool works from an object
         identifier it has received from an intermediary or can infer from a query where only one object exists.

         From this relatively simple operation emerge more complex issues, one of which is the variety of known item references that
         an intermediary must handle. At its simplest, a display tool will encounter references to page images in a format clearly
         identified by structural metadata. Similarly, the tool may receive a reference to an encoded text section such as a chapter,
         again in a format identified by structural metadata. Examples of references that are slightly more complex include requests
         to display the next or previous sibling of the digital object (next page or previous chapter) or the parent of the digital
         object (the chapter that includes this page). For images, an intermediary may request the display of a known item at a specific
         resolution. More challenging will be the standard articulation of a reference to display a portion (for example, "250 by 250
         pixels, centered on pixel X.Y") of an image at a specific resolution. Panning, zooming, and cropping of an image are variations
         on this type of request.
      </p>
      
      <p>Printing is a method similar to the display method; it differs only in its use of printers, plotters, disks, and other output
         devices. The option to print may use the same format as the option to display, as is the case with systems relying primarily
         on encapsulating images in portable document format (PDF) for delivery. The display and print methods are closely intertwined
         and differ according to the formats available from the repository and user preferences. For example, imagine that a repository
         of bitonal, 600 dpi page images offers graphics interchange format (GIF) images with interpolated grayscale, Postscript, and
         PDF. A user without Adobe Acrobat may choose to display the GIF images but print using the Postscript files containing encapsulated
         images. A user with Acrobat may choose to rely entirely on the PDF image files to print and display from the same source.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Combination or Comparison</h4>
      
      <p>As the body of materials in the digital library grows, the ability to create combinations of data or perform comparisons becomes
         increasingly important. <i>Combining</i> and <i>comparing</i> methodsmost common with art and architectural images (consider the common use of two slide projectors in art historical instruction)are
         applicable to both images and text. Support for the comparison of two passages of text or the display of a text alongside
         an image is also needed. Common applications might include the following:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>synchronous scrolling of a text in two different languages or a text with commentary;</li>
            
            <li>the side-by-side display of a text and an image (Dante Gabriel Rossetti's paintings and poetry, often using the same title
               or treating the same theme);
            </li>
            
            <li>the display of two images side by side;</li>
            
            <li>the display of an indeterminate number of image objects positioned in a grid; or</li>
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>-19-</i></p>
            
            
            <li>the display of a number of image objects positioned in a grid of specific dimensions.</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Somewhat more complex is the requirement to combine objects. The need to apply layers to, or remove them from, an object is
         especially important. This problem is considerably easier when a single repository has provided these layers with the base
         image; however, a more generic method is needed to allow the combination of layers from diverse sources. For example, the
         allegorical drawings found in nineteenth-century journals such as <i>Harper's Weekly</i> often contain contemporary public persons portrayed as historical figures. A server at one DLF institution might provide
         the images of the pages, while a second DLF institution might overlay commentary identifying each person. A tool supporting
         the display method might offer that image in any number of different resolutions; it might even display portions of the image
         cropped and enlarged. The ability to coordinate the annotations of the second institution with the page image from the first
         institution will require carefully controlled metadata about coordinates that stay constant with the cropped portion. While
         these types of administrative and structural metadata may be too challenging for early portions of the testbed project, the
         model must be flexible enough to accommodate this information in later iterations.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Repository Search</h4>
      
      <p>Repository search methods, more than most other methods, tend to be exhibited by server-side programs rather than by client-side
         tools.<a href="#p3n6"> [6]</a> At least portions of these methods could eventually migrate to the user's desktop, but considerable standardization must
         first take place. In a repository search, an intermediary collects information about the user's query and the characteristics
         of the available collections and begins to process results (for example, in a sorted list by object or by collection). This
         intermediary has distinct discovery and retrieval functions.
      </p>
      
      <p>To support discovery within and among repositories, each collection must participate in a conversation with the client or
         intermediary. This conversation constitutes the method associated with discovery. The repository's discovery method must include
         the ability to understand the search parameters of the repository, including gathering information on searchable fields, on
         the sorts of operators that can be applied, and other constraints. These mechanisms have been specified in protocols such
         as Z39.50, but it is important to explore
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-20-</i></p>
         
         more flexible mechanisms such as the search interface language (SIL) specified in Nigel Kerr's <i>Personal Collections and Cross-Collection Technical White Paper</i> (1997).
      </p>
      
      <p>To support the retrieval of results within and among repositories, the conversation must include a well-specified retrieval
         method. Results must come from the repository or repositories in a well-articulated and easily parsed syntax. The tool will
         use this syntax, for example, to build result lists, to bring together results from multiple repositories, and to compile
         results from multiple repositories. An example of a proposed specification for such a retrieval method can be found in Nigel
         Kerr's white paper.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Color Analysis</h4>
      
      <p>An admittedly challenging set of methods will come with richer and more reliable color metadata. The availability of a Color
         Look-up Table (CLUT), which provides color, shape, and texture distribution that can be processed through automatic means,
         will aid in a variety of tasks. For example, a color-matching behavior might take CLUT information from manuscript fragments,
         locating fragments that are more likely to be from the same paper stock because of color or texture. CLUT information can
         also be used to measure subtle variations such as shape and patterns; this would enable the user to detect, for example, hidden
         features such as characters obscured by palimpsest erasures. Methods using the CLUT could support these types of analyses.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Bookmarks, Annotations, and Links</h4>
      
      <p>As the digital library grows in maturity and capability, the array of interactions with objects will become more complex.
         Users want intraobject bookmarks, annotations, and more sophisticated linking methods, none of which is outside the capabilities
         of readily available desktop technology. Nevertheless, the ability to support these methods is hampered by unreliable or incomplete
         metadata, the absence of generalized notions of user authentication and authorization, and a lack of support from repositories.
         Most important, libraries and archives lack the tools to exploit methods in these areas. Many of these methods are explored
         in detail in the research applications developed by Robert Wilensky and his team as they pursue notions of "multivalent documents"
         (Phelps and Wilensky 1996). Moreover, emerging standards such as the extensible markup language (XML) and extensible linking
         language (XLL) will help articulate complex links (such as a span of information or "the third paragraph in the fourth section")
         within a remote document. These methods will be best supported through the articulation and adoption of architectures within
         which effective tools can be built and through metadata that document a full range of digital object features.

         <h3>MoA II Metadata</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Metadata can be in a header, a MARC record, a database or an SGML file, or they can be distributed among a variety of locations.
         An object or repository needs only to be able to reconstitute the metadata and present them to a user or application when
         requested (the discovery, navigation, and administrative functions).
      </p>
      
      <h4>Descriptive Metadata</h4>
      
      <p>The library community has a long history of developing standards and best practices for descriptive metadata (for example,
         MARC and the Dublin Core). Given existing standards and ongoing work to investigate descriptive metadata issues, the MoA II
         proposal did not focus on this area. Instead, the MoA II testbed used a union catalog with MARC records contributed by the
         participants. The participants also contributed finding aids encoded to the EAD community standard.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the discovery process, users will search the MoA II union catalog of MARC collection-level records that will be linked
         to their corresponding finding aids, and the finding aids will then be linked to the appropriate archival digital library
         object. Of course, it will also be possible to search the finding aids directly to discover archival library objects.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Structural Metadata</h4>
      
      <p>The terminology of the digital library is evolving rapidly. Consequently, there is considerable variation in how the library
         community uses certain terms, one of which is structural metadata. (For more information on the definition of structural metadata,
         readers are referred to Structural Metadata Notes in the Appendix.) For the purposes of this paper, the term <i>structural metadata</i> is defined as those metadata that are relevant to the presentation of a digital object to the user. Structural metadata describe
         the object in terms of navigation and use. The user navigates an object to explore the relationship of a subobject to other
         subobjects. Use refers to the format or formats of the objects available for use rather than formats stored.
      </p>
      
      <p>Current thinking divides digital library metadata into three categories (descriptive, administrative, and structural) or two
         categories (descriptive and structural, with structural metadata subsuming administrative metadata). This report separates
         administrative and structural metadata. More important than this separation, however, are the categories proposed for inclusion
         in the MoA II architecture.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although the categories defined here are presented in SGML, the data in a repository will not necessarily be stored in an
         encoded form or in a table. This document does not advocate a particular method for storing data; various approaches will
         be necessary in different institutions, and several approaches may even exist within the same institution. For example, descriptive
         metadata may be stored in USMARC, portions of structural and administrative data in relational tables, and other portions
         in SGML. These examples are intended to
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-22-</i></p>
         
         illustrate the type of data presented in interactions between repositories and intermediaries. The authors assume that these
         metadata will be extracted from metadata management systems in interactions with intermediaries such as tools. Further, default
         and inherited values will be expressed explicitly at the level of the subobject, even if implicitly associated with the subobject
         through the metadata management system.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Structural Metadata Elements and Features Tables</h4>
      
      <p>Tables 1 and 2 recommend the full set of possible structural metadata elements that an individual collection may find useful.
         Some repositories will use only the minimum set of required elements. Others will also use other elements that can be derived
         in an automated fashion. Still others will use elements that are easy to capture or derive. The tables include both minimal
         and maximal values, identify required and repeatable fields, and identify whether field values may be inherited or supplied
         manually. Some elements can fulfill both administrative and structural functions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some elements are relevant to raw data (such as page scans) which do not require extensive examination of the data structure.
         Other elements are relevant to "seared" data (such as chapter divisions and headings), which require only minimal examination
         of data structure to generate appropriate metadata. Still other elements are primarily relevant to "cooked" data (such as
         SGML marked-up text), which require serious examination of structure.<a href="#p3n7"> [7]</a></p>
      
      <p>Table 1 describes structural metadata defining the object, and table 2 describes structural metadata defining the digital
         subobjects (for example, the individual digital pages). Thus, the structural information for a digital object is divided into
         information referring to the constituent objects that cohere into a whole (such as a description of the extent of a digital
         book) and information specific to the individual parts (such as page or image references).<a href="#p3n8"> [8]</a> The distinction between object and subobject metadata is in some ways artificial. For example, a tool might assemble information
         related to the constituent parts of a photograph album by querying each of the constituent subobjects rather than by querying
         a specially designed digital object. However, certain economies, such as stating ownership only once in the object rather
         than with each subobject, prevail when storing information. This model strives to balance the specification of elements accordingly.

      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-23-</i></p>
      
      
      <h4>Administrative Metadata</h4>
      
      <p>Administrative metadata consist of the information that allows the repository to manage its digital collection. This information
         includes the following:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>data related to the creation of the digital image (such as date of scan, resolution)</li>
            
            <li>data that can identify an instantiation (version or edition) of the image and help determine what is needed to view or use
               it (storage or delivery file format, compression scheme, filename or location)
            </li>
            
            <li>ownership, rights, and reproduction information</li>
            
         </ul> Some metadata elements are both structural and administrative and may be used for similar purposes in those two areas. For
         example, <i>content type</i> is a structural metadata element used to present available file formats to a service, while <i>file format</i> is an administrative metadata element that tells systems administrators the format of a particular file.
      </p>
      
      <p>Administrative metadata are critical for long-term file management. Without well-designed administrative metadata, image file
         contents may be as unrecognizable and unreadable a decade from now as Wordstar or VisiCalc files are today. Administrative
         metadata should help future administrators determine the file type, creation date, source of original, methods or personnel
         that might have introduced artifacts into the image, and location where different parts of this digital object (or related
         objects) reside. Eventually, administrative metadata may help support the long-term management of objects; for example, the
         metadata contained within the objects will allow for automation of migration from an older file format to a newer one, for
         refreshment, and for regular backup.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the past, certain administrative metadata (such as file formats) resided in file headers, while others resided in accompanying
         databases. In the future, all administrative metadata may reside within the file header. Such a system would be ineffective,
         however, until there are community standards that specify where they would go within the header, how to express them, and
         so forth. Work is already under way to develop those standards. In April 1999, NISO, DLF, and RLG convened a meeting to discuss
         technical metadata elements for images. The results of the meeting are available on the Web (Bearman 1999). For the purposes
         of this paper, the necessary administrative metadata fields are defined without regard to a particular syntax of where they
         will actually reside.<b> </b>For the purposes of the MoA II project, administrative metadata will be delivered external to the image file header.
      </p>
      
      <p>This section primarily concerns administrative metadata for master files. In the future, however, repositories are likely
         to see master files that are themselves derivatives of previous files. To make the administrative metadata that the authors
         identify as compatible as possible with future developments, some information dealing with
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-24-</i></p>
         
         derivative files (or other instantiations of a work) is included. In this way, the project will lay the groundwork for future
         research projects to identify and trace the provenance of a particular digital work.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>Administrative Metadata Elements and Features Tables</h4>
      
      <p>Tables 3-6 recommend the full set of administrative metadata elements that an individual collection may find useful. Some
         repositories will use only the minimum set of required elements; others will also use elements that can be derived in an automated
         fashion. Still others will choose to use elements that are easy to capture or derive. The tables include both minimal and
         maximal values and specify which are allowed to repeat. Some elements can fulfill both administrative and structural functions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although the number of metadata fields seems daunting, a high proportion may be the same for all the images scanned during
         a particular session. For example, metadata about the scanning device, light source, or date are likely to be the same for
         an entire session. Some metadata about the different parts of a single object (such as the scan of each page of a book) will
         be the same for that entire object. This kind of repeating metadata will not require keyboarding each field for each digital
         image; instead, they can be handled either through inheritance or by batch-loading various metadata fields. This report attempts
         to identify best practices for metadata development. Individual repositories will follow these practices to the extent that
         they can afford.
      </p>
      
      <p>Tables 3-6 describe elements needed for the creation of a digital master image; identification of the digital image and tools
         for viewing or using it<b>;</b> linking the parts of a digital object or its instantiations; providing context; and ownership, rights, and reproduction information.
         Tables 3 and 4 show the type of data that uniquely identify a particular representation of a work. For future derivative images,
         these could be iteratively nested to represent the provenance of a work.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Encoding: Best Practices</h4>
      
      <h4>Encoding Archival Object Content and Finding Aids</h4>
      
      <p>Many MoA II materials require text encoding. This may be the case whether the documents are carefully transcribed and edited
         versions of the original documents, whether they simply organize (conceptually) a mass of automatically generated text via
         optical character recognition (OCR), or whether only the framework of a document is encoded, with pointers to images. Moreover,
         finding aids for many resources will be encoded to support fine-grained access to a collection. There has been substantial
         work and community effort in both areas, and efforts are under way to organize discussions around the use of the available
         guidelines.
      </p>
      
      <p>Project participants should use the EAD for the encoding of finding aids.<a href="#p3n9"> [9]</a> While the EAD guidelines allow considerable latitude for the application of markup to finding aids, work with the EAD must
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-25-</i></p>
         
         grow out of local assessment of the needs for finding aid support and the way that these finding aids will be used. Discussions
         are under way in the DLF about interinstitutional searching of EAD-encoded collections and the resulting scrutiny of local
         practice. Using locally defined needs to drive the application of EAD will help clarify the range of needs for interinstitutional
         applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>Text encoding efforts in MoA II will be well supported by the SGML articulated in the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines
         (TEI).<a href="#p3n10"> [10]</a> The TEI support a range of document types and methods, including the transcription of primary sources and damaged documents.
         More important, the TEI Guidelines and the associated DTDs (document-type descriptors) offer support for encoding the range
         of possible structures in MoA II documents, whether or not transcriptions are included. The TEI, like the EAD, offers considerable
         flexibility in the ways documents can be encoded.
      </p>
      
      <p>A further note on the relevance of XML to these two central encoding schemas may be useful. XML promises to bring richly encoded
         documents to the user's desktop through widely available browsers. Moreover, a growing array of XML-capable tools should be
         available through mainstream software development. XML-compliant versions of both the TEI and the EAD DTDs are likely to be
         available soon. One editor of the TEI guidelines has been centrally involved in writing the XML specifications, and the TEI
         editors have declared their intention to create XML-compliant versions of the widely used TEI DTDs.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h4>Encoding to Encapsulate Metadata and Content Inside the Archival Object</h4>
      
      <p>After this report has been circulated and discussed, the project team will have gathered enough information to define an encoding
         scheme for the archival objects that will populate the MoA II testbed. A draft of the MoA II XML DTD has been completed and
         readers are referred to view both the DTD and documentation available at <a href="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/MOA2/">http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/MOA2/</a> (see the section on MoA II Tools). This XML DTD will define the transfer syntax used for MoA II objects. Selecting an XML
         to encode the object does not mean that any repository must use that encoding for internal object storage. However, it does
         give the DLF and the larger community an opportunity to discuss and evaluate XML as transfer syntax.

            with inter-repository searcheshow one characterizes the search to the various systems and brings together results from those
            different collections. Nevertheless, the ability to perform a search across a number of distributed repositories becomes increasingly
            important as we distribute responsibility, while maintaining important elements of institu-tional autonomy. Repository search,
            and especially the means to support inter-repository search, is discussed here not because it must be explored in MoA II but
            because it is an important method to keep in mind when conceptualizing the digital library.

         <h2>APPENDIX: STRUCTURAL METADATA NOTES</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>
         <ul>
            
            <li>Structural metadata is metadata that describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials"
               (Arms, Blanchi, and Overly 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>Structural metadata [for digital objects for individual versions] includes other metadata associated with the specific version.
               It includes fields for description, owner, handle of meta-object, data size, data type (e.g., "jpg"), version number, description,
               date deposited, use (e.g., "thumbnail"), and the date of the last revision" (Arms, Blanchi, and Overly 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>Structural metadata [for the meta-object] is the metadata that applies to the original photograph and to all of its versions.
               It includes a description, the owner, the number of versions, the date deposited, the use ("meta-object"), and the date of
               last revision. If bibliographic information were to be included, it would be added to this part of the meta-object" (Arms,
               Blanchi, and Overly 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>Schema definitions are of course very basic forms of metadata. We refer to a schema definition language as structural metadata,
               and distinguish it from the representation of semantics, meaning, and purposefor which we would use the term semantic metadata.
               In general, we would like a single metadata model to encompass structure and semantics, and, preferably capable of representing
               most data models" (Morgenstern 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>Looking at the larger picture, there are three type of "metadata" which have been identified by the National Digital Library
               Project of the U.S. Library of Congress as being relevant to digital collections, namely: (1) descriptive metadata (such as
               MARC cataloguing records, finding aids, or locally developed practices for describing what the images are about); (2) structural
               metadata (the information that ties the images to each other to make up a logical unit such as a journal article or archival
               folder); (3) administrative metadata (what allows the repository to manage the digital collection, such as scan date and resolution,
               storage format and filename)" (Gartner 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>The [Metadata Working] Group worked with the broadest definition of metadata; that is, data about data. It was agreed that
               the purpose of metadata was (a) to help the user discover or locate resources; (b) to describe those resources in order to
               help users determine whether the resources would be useful; and (c) to provide physical access to the electronic resource.
               In the broadest terms, metadata can be characterized as either descriptive or structural. Descriptive metadata, such as a
               MARC record, provides intellectual access to a work while structural metadata, such as a TIFF header, can be queried and operated
               on to provide physical access and navigational structure to a document-like
               
               
               <hr width="75%">
               <p align="center"><i>-33-</i></p>
               
               object. Much of the discussion in the MWG meetings focused on descriptive metadata; however, a subgroup of the MWG and the
               Full-Text Working Group met to identify and assess the structural and descriptive metadata which underlies the various scanned
               image projects at Cornell" (World Wide Web Working Group, Cornell University Library, 1996).
            </li>
            
            <li>[Cornell University Library] should embed structural metadata within full-text resources to enable direct access to special
               document features, such as tables of contents, title pages, indices, etc., and also correlate image sequence numbers to actual
               page numbers of the document to enhance navigation within "loosely-bound" electronic documents (e.g., individual scanned image
               files for pages of a document)" (Cornell University, Distillation of the Working Group Recommendations, 1996).
            </li>
            
            <li>Structural metadata is used for creation and maintenance of the information warehouse. It fully describes information warehouse
               structure and content. The basic building block of structural metadata is a model that describes its data entities, their
               characteristics, and how they are related to one another. The way potential information warehouse users currently use, or
               intend to use, enterprise measures provides insight into how to best serve them from the information warehouse; i.e., what
               data entities to include and how to aggregate detailed data entities. A Visible Advantage information warehouse data model
               provides a means of documenting and identifying both strategic and operational uses of enterprise measures. It also provides
               the capability to document multi-dimensional summarization of detail data" (Perkins 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li>Structural metadata identifies the system of record for all information warehouse data entities. It also fully describes the
               integration and transformation logic for moving each information warehouse entity from its system of record to the information
               warehouse. In addition, structural metadata defines the refreshment schedule and archive requirements for every data entity"
               (Perkins 1997).
            </li>
            
            <li><i>Structural data</i>This is data defining the logical components of complex or compound objects and how to access those components. A simple example
               is a table of contents for a textual document. A more complex example is the definition of the different source files, subroutines,
               data definitions in a software suite" (Lagoze, Lynch, and Daniel 1996).
