	</B></DT><DD>
	User guide for OLIVIA - a software program developed at Harvard University Library which
	 catalogers can use to enter data about their collections. The data entered into OLIVIA is 
	stored in a more complex relational format than is allowed by standard flat-file MARC 
	records. This data can, in turn, be exported to the Visual Information Access (VIA) system. 
	VIA is a web-accessible union catalog of visual resources at Harvard and Radcliffe. OLIVIA is
	 a client/server application. The client program is installed on each cataloger's desktop, and 
	each client connects to a central server where the data is stored in a relational database. 
	Access to the system requires a valid account (username and password). System 
	administration services for OLIVIA are available from the Harvard University Library's 
	Office for Information Systems. Also see OLIVIA to VIA map -  Works Records (a data 
	map that specifies how fields from the OLIVIA records populate fields in the public catalog 
	- at http://hul.harvard.edu/ldi/resources/olivia-to-via_datamap.pdf) and INVIA Data

	Initiative of Harvard University Libraries. It attempts to establish some common 
	definitions and understandings of a digital repository within the Harvard LDI context, to

	</B></DT><DD>
	EAD-encoded finding aids are proving to be a significant part of the metadata strategy of 
	the emerging digital library. During 1998-99, the Digital Library Federation underwrote a 
	project proposed by the University of Michigan and Harvard University to develop an 
	automated system for distributed online searching of EAD-encoded finding aids. The 
	participating institutions were, in addition to Michigan and Harvard, Columbia University, 
	Indiana University, and Oxford University. The project, known as the Distributed Finding 
	Aid Server (DFAS), was completed in July of 1999 with the publication of a final report. 
	This article summarizes the project and discusses some of the major issues that were 
	identified by it.
