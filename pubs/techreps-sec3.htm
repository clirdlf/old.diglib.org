	Puglia, Steven and Barry Roginski.
	These guidelines have been developed to provide a method of evaluating the quality of

	files, and to assist in determining the need for upgrades to the NARA network infrastructure.

	National Archives and Records Administration.

	<DL><DT><b>Criteria for Selection for Retrospective Digitization
	</B></DT><DD>
	Selection criteria developed by the University of Chicago Library's Digital Library 
	Development Center - providing leadership in the creation, implementation, and assessment
	 of digital library initiatives, and developing and maintaining a sustainable architecture to 
	support the Library's Web-based information systems.  Criteria fall into two categories: 
	traditional collection development criteria involving the estimation of the intrinsic 
	intellectual value of the material and whether value can be increased and enhanced through 
	digitization; and criteria based on extrinsic factors of feasibility and practicality.

	<DL><DT><b>Selection Criteria for Digital Imaging Projects
	</B></DT><DD>
	While they are not prescriptive, the criteria should be applied to the process of selecting 
	materials for digital imaging before any new project is initiated. It is at this point expensive 
	to select, create, and maintain digital resources, with the cost of image-capture accounting 
	for less than half of the total expense. It is important to establish the degree of institutional
	 support and funding that is likely when priorities are being determined.
