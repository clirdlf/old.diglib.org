<B>Volume 2 Number 1 January 2001</B>

<H2>Editorial</H2>
<P>This issue of the DLF newsletter includes updates on developments at the
California Digital Library, Cornell University, Harvard University, the
Library of Congress, and the University of Michigan. It also includes a new
report from the University of Southern California.

<P>The issue also includes a report from the DLF Office of the Director.
That report documents progress with ongoing DLF initiatives (e.g. the Open
Archives Initiatives, AIC/ArtSTOR, reference linking, review of DLF best
practice recommendations). It also introduces a number of new DLF
initiatives including ones intended to:
<UL>
<LI>design and possibly prototype a cataloguing tool for visual resources,
<LI>design and possibly prototype a service to register digitized monographs
and journals;
<LI>develop standards for describing technical, structural, and
administrative characteristics of digital objects;
<LI>investigate changing patterns of library use.
</UL>

<P>The report finally announces the DLF Spring Forum 2001 (to be held in San
Francisco, May 4-6) that we hope will be well attended.
