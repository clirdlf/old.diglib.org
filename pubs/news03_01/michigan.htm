<DIR>
<P><B>Users Flock to Making of America Collection</b><BR>
With the addition of nearly 3 million pages in February 2001, the Making of America (MoA) collection - a publicly-accessible online resource focusing on 19th century American publications - has witnessed unprecedented usage, averaging nearly 1,000,000 true uses per month.  Noted historian and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin delivered the keynote address at the campus celebration of the project in March 2001.  
<BR><a href="http://moa.umdl.umich.edu/">http://moa.umdl.umich.edu/</a> 
<P><B>University of Michigan Regents Proceedings Online</b><BR>
The complete run of the <I>Regents Proceedings</I> of the University of Michigan has been digitized and made available online.  The <I>Proceedings</I> document University history and serve as a significant tool for historians focused on Michigan state history. A larger effort to capture significant institutional documents is underway to which these Proceedings will be added. 
<BR><a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/u/umregproc/">http://www.hti.umich.edu/u/umregproc/</a>
 
<P><B>Pin Yin Conversion Completed </b><BR>
 
The Wade Giles to Pin Yin conversion was completed and the files (164,984 RLIN bibliographic records and 30,585 OCLC authority records) were successfully processed and loaded into MIRLYN (the University's OPAC) overlaying existing bibliographic and authority records with the new forms.  Manual cleanup has been completed on major headings in 16,000 records; cleanup of headings in the notes fields of 14,000 records continues.
 
<P><B>Authentication Pilot Program Underway</b><BR>
 
Exploration of systems and tools to reduce risks of anonymous access at public workstations was conducted with pilot programs launched to test methods of screening anonymous email sites or requiring authentication for full Internet access.  Authentication pilot efforts are currently underway in several campus libraries.  Users who do not authenticate (i.e., those who are not affiliated with the University or those who choose not to authenticate) will not receive access to external email tools.  These efforts were in response to continued concerns on campus relative to network security. The ability for anonymous access to library licensed or identified resources is sustained in this model.
 
<P><B>Partnership Formed Between Digitization and Preservation Units </b><BR>
 
With the adoption of digital capture as the University Library's default method for reformatting, Preservation and DLS Digitization Services have formed a collaborative partnership to share expertise and resources.  Efforts are currently underway to relocate all reformatting staff, whether part of the Preservation or Digitization units, in the same facility.  This partnership will create a more seamless service for brittle books reformatting, OCR, digital photography, bitonal and continuous tone imaging, preparation of materials for outsourcing, and management of all reformatting activities.
<P><B>Access to Digital Audio and Video Resources Under Development</b><BR>
Interface support for audio and video resources is under development with an initial focus on static (vs. streaming) files.  In related efforts, DLS staff are participating in a multi-institutional grant proposal to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to build a distributed digital archive of ethnomusicology materials, including video and audio resources.
 
<P><B>Integration of Non-Traditional Records Into OPAC Explored</b><BR>
 
Library Systems staff are exploring (with cataloging staff) methods to process and integrate non-traditional records and record-sets into MIRLYN, the Library's online bibliographic system.  A combination of innovative techniques using Perl scripts and GTO were tested on more than 25,000 records, including NetLibrary, the Michigan Electronic Library (MEL), electronic resources from the University's Business School, ICPSR codebooks, and Making of America resources.
<P><B>LMS Developments</b><BR>
Several enhancements to the OCLC WebZ product, used for the web version of MIRLYN, were added or enhanced, including: call number searching; browse searching; scan results screens for no-hits; improved Saved Records feature; patron empowerment for intra-library, inter-library loan, and recalls/holds; location-based catalogs; and integrated hook-to-holdings for locally mounted index files.  Two non-WebZ enhancements are email notices and courtesy notices for patrons. The UM Library is also engaged in review of new LMS options through a formal RFP process.
<P><B>Scholarly Publishing Office Develops New Publications</b><BR>
The Scholarly Publishing Office is working with faculty and University units to develop electronic publications and online tools to manage those publications.  In addition to the <I>Philosopher's Imprint</I>, an electronic-only journal in philosophy, and the digital version of the <I>Michigan Quarterly Review</I>, new publications include: the journal <I>Cross Currents</I>; <I>Post Identity</I>; the online version of the <I>Michigan Directory of Ethnic Organizations</I>; an initial online version of the <I>Annotated Bibliography of the French Revolution</I>; <I>The Medieval Review</I>; a project to create a collaborative English language translation of Diderot's <I>Encyclopedie</I>; and, a collaboration with University of Michigan faculty to create an electronic publication forum for highlighting new public scholarship.  Other content-building efforts include: a collaborative proposal to the U-M College of Engineering to work on data transformations and system building for an archive of engineering publications and work with the U-M Special Collections Library in creating two web exhibits (<I>The Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia</I> and <I>Joseph Labadie's Gift to Michigan</I>).  
<BR><a href="http://spo.umdl.umich.edu/">http://spo.umdl.umich.edu/</a>
<P><B>MyLibrary Implemented</b><BR>
The Library-wide effort to develop user customization tools for web resources has been completed and the resulting product - MyLibrary - is now available for patron use.  MyLibrary offers patrons a customized interface for easy access to frequently-used resources and tools, and has been well-received by users.
<P><B>DLXS Middleware and XPAT Search Engine Enhanced</b><BR>
New versions of the Text and Image classes of DLXS middleware were made available, as well as initial releases of the Finding Aids and Bibliographic classes.  Work continues on the "application object" feature to enable cross-class searching.  Enhancements to the XPAT search engine include a Linux port.  DLXS middleware is available in an open source environment; XPAT is available for a one-time fee from the University of Michigan.
<BR><a href="http://www.dlxs.org/">http://www.dlxs.org/</a>
 
<P><B>Library Server Environment Overhauled</b><BR>
 
A number of modifications and improvements to the Library's server environment have been implemented.  A parallel production server environment was developed to ensure that web services can be fully tested prior to release.  A system of mirroring and redundancy was also instituted, with two identical server environments in physically-separate locations ensuring proper load balancing and 24x7 access to resources.  Nearly a dozen new servers were installed and configured during this process; a small number of Linux servers were also deployed to support basic architecture, data processing, and related development.
 
<P><B>Reliance on Social Security Numbers for Patron Records Eliminated</b><BR>
 
With the University's move to a new system for managing human resource and personnel data, the University Library successfully removed social security numbers from records and authentication requirements.  Identification is now managed through a University-generated identification number.
 
<P><B>Refinement of Workstation Environment Continues</b><BR>
 
With the creation of the new Desktop Support Services unit, a number of new initiatives related to the Library's workstation environment are underway.  ZenWorks, a tool to automatically "push" software to desktop computers and manage applications, was implemented in a trial phase in an effort to increase stability, reduce maintenance and provide for more streamlined management.  A staff member devoted to technology training has been hired to develop programs, tools, and services for Library staff as well as develop documentation and tools for those who provide technology support.

<DIR>
<P><B>Digital Library Initiatives Become Digital Library Services</b><BR>
Following a year of reorganization and a broadening of focus, Digital Library Initiatives was renamed Digital Library Services (DLS) to reflect its broader mission in serving the University Library and the information technology community.  DLS units include Library Systems, the Digital Library Production Service, the Scholarly Publishing Office, and Desktop Support Services. 
 
<P><B>DLS Nominated for 2002 Smithsonian Computerworld Honors Program</b><BR>
 
Sun Microsystems has nominated Digital Library Services for recognition through the Smithsonian Computerworld Honors Program.  Established in 1988, the Program seeks to document the information technology revolution and is "dedicated to identifying the men and women, the organizations and institutions, that are leading this revolution and to recording the impact of their achievements on society."  
<BR><a href="http://www.cwheroes.org/">http://www.cwheroes.org/</a>
 
<P><B>Collaboration with University of Illinois to Yield an "Academic Hotbot" </b><BR>
 
The University Library - in collaboration with the University of Illinois - has received funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to establish a broad, generic, information retrieval source for information about publicly available digital library objects.  The service will be build through a collaboration that relies on the University of Illinois' metadata harvester, and middleware developed through the collaboration will be made available freely to other institutions for implementation.
 
<P><B>Handbook Outlining Large-Scale Digitization Costs Completed</b><BR>
 
A major component of the Making of America (MoA) Project was the documentation of costs for large-scale conversion efforts such as MoA.  With the MoA project completed, a handbook - <I>Assessing the Costs of Conversion</I> - has been prepared for The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to assist the Foundation and the information community by providing a benchmark for similar efforts.  A summary of the findings fully documented in the handbook was included in a recent RLG <I>DigiNews</I> article (<a href="http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews5-5.html#feature2">http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews5-5.html#feature2</a>).

<P><B>DLS Assists in the Creation of a Digital Distribution Center</b><BR>
Digital Library Services will assist the University of Chicago Press in the development of a digital distribution center for university presses (funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation).  DLS will provide digitization services, drawing in its extensive experience in large-scale conversion projects such as the Making of America.
 
<P><B>ACLS History E-Book Project Moves Forward </b><BR>
Work continues on both the frontlist (current publications) and backlist (previously produced in print format) publications for the ACLS History E-Book project.  Digitization and OCR of the first installment of materials has been completed.  DLS is working with ACLS to develop delivery mechanisms for the frontlist; access to the backlist will be available through an adaptation of the Making of America interface.  Scholarly Publishing Office staff are working to develop support mechanisms such as statistics gathering, authentication, and royalty tracking to assist publishers in managing access to materials made available through the project.
 
<P><B>Work Continues on IMLS-Funded Effort </b><BR>
 
Significant progress has been made on various aspects of the IMLS-funded "Great Lakes Flora and Fauna" project.  Field notes have been scanned and cataloged, mammal maps have been digitized, and three collection databases were deployed in November.  Metadata work for the "Flora and Fauna" materials has proven challenging due to the variety of materials included and the range of audiences to be supported.
 
<P><B>DLS Staff Support International Collaboration</b><BR>
 
Two DLS staff members traveled abroad to support digital library efforts in developing regions.  John Price Wilkin traveled to Cuba with a delegation of librarians and researchers, sponsored by the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, to discuss opportunities for cooperation and resource sharing.  Brian Rosenblum traveled to Kyrgrzstan to share expertise and information on digital libraries with university administrators, librarians, and library school students.
 
<P><B>Interoperability Between Distributed Collections Explored</b><BR>
 
Development of several enhancements to allow interoperability between distributed collections is underway through the NSF-sponsored "Development of a Distributed Library of Mathematical Monographs" project, in collaboration with Cornell University and the State and University Library of Gottingen (Germany).  Implementation of the OAI verbs (to be used in conjunction with other Deinst verbs to enable interoperability) has been completed, as well as implementation of all Dienst verbs that access bibliographic records.  In related efforts, work has been completed on an OAI-compliant "broker" which will be utilized for this project as well as made available to the OAI community for accessing bibliographic records.

<P><B>Library Management System Search Continues</b><BR>
 
The University Library continued its search for a new library management system.  Following the dissemination for an RFI and RFP, proposals from a number of vendors were evaluated and finalists were selected.  Each finalist presented a two-day demonstration of their product to University Library staff, and a team from the University Library visited campuses where each product is currently in use.  Evaluation of all information gathered during the campus and site visits is underway, and a recommendation will be prepared for review by Library and campus administrators.
