<DIR> 
<P><B>Digital Repository Service (DRS) </b><BR>
DRS provides professionally managed, secure, long-term storage and preservation services for digital objects. DRS works in concert with the Name Resolution Service (NRS) and the Access Management Service (AMS) to provide persistent access to networked resources and secure access to resources that are restricted to the Harvard community. We have been investigating cost effective storage systems for massive amounts of data, and in the next several months, we will be implementing a combination of disk and tape technologies to provide a very safe, replicated infrastructure for the digital objects stored in the DRS.  Currently 243, 428 digital objects (including image files full-text for searching and associated metadata to aid in the navigation) are stored in DRS. An administrative interface for object owners is under development.

<P><B>E-reserves  </b><BR>
The E-reserves system is a web-based service that provides students with online access to course reserve reading materials. E-reserves, in full-scale production since 2000, is currently limited to shorter print materials, such as articles and book chapters. Material available through E-reserves is secured to registered students following the fourth week of each term. During the 2000-01 academic year, the E-reserves system supported a total of 85 courses.

<P><B>Harvard College Library Digital Imaging Group (HCL DIG)	</b><BR>
HCL DIG, a group within HCL's Preservation & Imaging Services, is dedicated to producing high quality reproductions of a wide range of library and archival materials. In operation since July 1999, HCL DIG provides document scanning, film scanning, digital photography, image processing, metadata creation, and DRS deposit services for digital still images. In its second year, the group produced more than 22,000 black-and-white images and more than 7,000 color images in support of LDI, HCL, and E-reserves projects.

<P><B>HOLLIS Portal			</b><BR>
The HOLLIS Portal is a comprehensive web interface-or portal-that presents a single, organized view of web-accessible resources available to the Harvard community. Over 1,009,000 individual user connections to licensed electronic resources were logged in the portal this year. More than 1,800 resources were added, including a variety of indexes and full-text resources. The HOLLIS portal also serves as an electronic "front door" to Harvard's union catalogs and to comprehensive information about Harvard's libraries.
<BR>The portal: <a href="http://lib.harvard.edu">http://lib.harvard.edu</a>

<P><B>Access Management Service (AMS) </b><BR>
AMS coordinates several steps necessary for the security of networked resources. These steps include user authentication, profiling, authorization, and access protocols specific to categories of resources. Authentication is performed by the University's central PIN service. Profiling information on authenticated users is retrieved from the University Directory Service. AMS can also serve to restrict access to specific resources when licensing or other agreements require it. Overall, the service, designed to minimize the need for repeated authentication of users, is available to all of the University's libraries. In FY 2001, AMS handled over 1,400,000 requests for access to restricted resources.
 
<P><B>Image Delivery Service (IDS) </b><BR>
IDS delivers digital images that are stored in the Digital Repository Service (DRS) to web browsers. In general, images available through this service have been converted from photographs, slides, prints, and other two-dimensional media held in special collections throughout the University. IDS can secure images to the Harvard community (i.e., those with a Harvard ID number and PIN) when appropriate. Currently, IDS is the service that delivers many of the digital images described in the VIA catalog, but it can also serve images cataloged in HOLLIS, OASIS, or any other catalog or web site that supports URL linking.
 
<P><B>Name Resolution Service (NRS) </b><BR>
NRS provides digital objects with persistent, location-independent identifiers that ensure network access regardless of an object's physical location, which may change freely over time.  Names and their associated URLs can be created and maintained through HOLLIS portal update procedures (for portal resources); DRS (for deposited objects); or through the direct interactive and batch interfaces to the administrative system. In 2001, the NRS responded to 2,757,705 requests for name resolution. The busiest day to date was Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2001, with 25,201 requests.
 
<P><B>O A S I S 					</b><BR>
OASIS (the Online Archival Search Information System) is a web-based union catalog of archival and manuscript finding aids created by archives, repositories, and academic departments throughout the University. Curators and archivists contribute to OASIS using SGML or XML to convert print finding aids into digital form. Currently, there are 402 finding aids available from eleven participating departments. OASIS delivers over 5,000 pages each month.

<P><B>O L I V I A			             </b><BR>
OLIVIA is a cataloging support system that supplies descriptive data about visual resources to the VIA catalog. It is Harvard's first centrally supported cataloging environment specifically designed for images. It currently contains over 258000
entries for slides, photographs, prints, posters, trade cards, and other visual materials. Major developments for OLIVIA this year include the creation of a staff training program and an extensive review and revision of the controlled vocabulary lists used in the system.

<P><B>Page Delivery Service (PDS) </b><BR>
PDS, launched in the summer of 2001, delivers scanned page images to web browsers and allows the user to navigate through digitized materials, such as a single-page diary entry, a 500-page article, or a set of annual reports. To enable navigation through a specific object, it is necessary to capture information about its structure. This structural information is stored in XML files (currently using the MOA2 DTD and soon migrating to METS). The Harvard and Radcliffe annual reports comprise the first data set available through PDS. These reports include 105,000 scanned page images. Access to the Harvard and Radcliffe Annual Reports is provided through the Online Historical Reference Shelf at: <BR><a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/huarc/refshelf/HROHRSHome.htm">http://hul.harvard.edu/huarc/refshelf/HROHRSHome.htm</a>
 
<P><B>Full-text Search Service (FTS) </b><BR>
FTS was launched in the summer of 2001 to provide a mechanism for efficient indexing and retrieval of textual digital objects. Search options include Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), quoted phrases, and proximity. For indexed text items that have dates associated with them, searches can be qualified by a date or date range. The FTS server is accessed as an option of PDS for searching the full text (such as OCR) of page-turned objects. The FTS server can also be accessed directly, as in the case of the Harvard-Radcliffe Online Historical Reference Shelf (see PDS above for URL).
 
<P><B>V I A </b><BR>
VIA is a web-based, union catalog describing the photographs, prints, drawings, paintings, and other visual resources held by Harvard libraries, archives, and museums. VIA contains more than 142,000 cataloging records and 27,469 "thumbnail" images. During FY 2001, its second full year of operation, VIA averaged over 400 connections and 1,300 searches per month.

<P><B>Harvard Geospatial Library (HGL) </b><BR>
Released this fall, HGL combines library services with tools that enable discovery and analyses of geospatial material and provides cartography features for creating maps. Currently in its first phase, HGL makes available ten of the most frequently requested geospatial data sets. The system currently averages over 50 sessions each day, with the highest recorded number at 210 sessions in one day. Phase two will integrate the analysis tools using new ESRI middleware, streamline the user interface to accommodate raster data, develop a new cataloging work station for geospatial metadata, and load the next group of the most frequently requested data sets.

<P><B>Library Digital Initiative (LDI) </b><BR>
At Harvard, LDI -a five-year, University-wide effort (which we will extend to six years)-is creating the common infrastructure of catalogs, delivery systems and repository services required for the burgeoning number of digital materials held in collections throughout the Harvard University Library. LDI, in its fourth year, is ensuring that Harvard can provide effective, long-term management for the digital materials that form an increasingly significant aspect of Harvard's library holdings. We have called it the Library Digital Initiative rather than the Harvard Digital Library because we do not think of it as something separate from the rest of the Harvard Library based on our massive print collections, but rather, as an integral part of the University Library.
<BR>Program Information: <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ldi">http://hul.harvard.edu/ldi </a>
 
<P><B>Internal Challenge Grant Program</b><BR>
Through the Internal Challenge Grant Program, Harvard's libraries and repositories can achieve specific goals for digital collections and LDI can enhance its digital infrastructure and test its systems and services. Libraries and library-sponsored programs throughout the University propose projects and contribute funds to their completion. Proposals selected by the LDI Grant Review Committee are implemented collaboratively by the LDI team with staff members of the proposing libraries. To date, twelve projects have been funded through the LDI Internal Challenge Grant Program and three projects have been completed:

<P><B>Advisory and Technical Services</b><BR>
LDI provides expertise and assistance to the University's libraries, archives, museums, and research projects that are involved in collecting or creating digital resources. These advisory and technical services fall into three main areas: <B>digital acquisitions</b> ~ for issues of licensing, contracting, and vendor relations; <B>metadata</b> ~ for standards and best practices related to the creation of data for describing and providing access to digital materials and for managing digital collections; and <B>reformatting</b> ~ for information about technologies, standards, vendors, and workflow design.

<P><B>Digital Preservation</b><BR>
LDI staff members are working on development of a preservation policy for digital objects stored and managed by Harvard University Library's Digital Repository Service (DRS). Offered as part of DRS services, digital preservation policies and procedures will ensure that stored objects will remain usable in perpetuity. Preservation requires active monitoring of file formats and affordable strategies to transform data to new formats to keep pace with inevitable changes in technology. Current work includes analysis of the requirements needed to document, validate, and monitor file formats in order to guard against threats of obsolescence, which will evolve as preservation guidelines for deposits to DRS.

<P><B>LOCKSS		</b><BR>
Harvard University is participating in the beta test of LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe), a project of Stanford University's Highwire Press. The goal of LOCKSS is to preserve access to scientific journals published on the web by maintaining multiple copies at various sites and by conducting periodic comparisons among them to ensure that materials remain consistent and authentic. The system aims to ensure that digital resources are protected through large-scale replication. Several generations of the beta software have been installed. Preliminary tests are validating the system architecture and underlying protocols.

<P><B>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Project</b><BR>
In January 2001, Harvard received a planning grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-one of six such grants awarded nationwide-to study the technical, organizational, and economic issues involved in archiving electronic journals. As with all digital materials, continuous effort and investment will be required to maintain the vitality of E-journals over time to prevent obsolescence caused by continuous technological change. Precisely who will have the responsibility, the resources, and the expertise to maintain and preserve E-journals for the use of future generations is not yet clear. Harvard is studying these issues jointly with three publisher-partners-Blackwell Publishers, the University of Chicago Press, and John Wiley & Sons.

<P><B>Reference Linking </b><BR>
For two years, Dale P. Flecker, associate director of the Harvard University Library for Planning and Systems, has had a leading role in a national effort that links a number of publishers, libraries, and technology providers together with the National Information Standards Organization. Their collaborative goal is to develop a robust architecture that will support a rich environment of linking between citations and electronic journal articles. This past year, a project involving a number of libraries and E-journal-related systems was conducted, demonstrating that the proposed architecture could provide links to the appropriate copies of articles distributed across several systems. At the end of the year, considerations about implementing this architecture for widespread use were well underway.

<P><B>Virtual Data Center (VDC)		</b><BR>		   
With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Digital Libraries Initiative Program and in partnership with the University of Michigan, the Harvard University Library and the Harvard-MIT Data Center (HMDC) are developing an open source "digital library in a box" for social sciences data. Beta versions are available. The production service is now in use at HMDC and will be in the near future at Radcliffe's Murray Research Center. This release provides a lightweight digital repository service, a Z39.50-enabled cataloging service, integrated online exploratory data analysis, Open Archives Initiative harvesting interfaces, and support for the creation, cataloging, and preservation of distributed virtual collections.
