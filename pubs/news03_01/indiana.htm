<P><B>Digital Library of the Commons</b><BR>
From 1999-2001, we worked with the Workshop on Political Theory and Policy Analysis to develop a web site to support the publication of working papers on common pool resources.  The workshop currently hosts the web site of the International Association for the Study of Common Property (IASCP), mounting conference papers and providing links to full-text resources <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~iascp/library.html">http://www.indiana.edu/~iascp/library.html</a>.   The web site was launched during the fall of 2001.  The Digital Library of the Commons is running on Eprints, open archive software available for download at <a href="http://eprints.org/">http://eprints.org/</a>.

<P><B>Indiana Magazine of History Online Index </b><BR>
 In the summer of 2000, the Library Electronic Text Resource Service (LETRS) was approached by the Indiana Magazine of History Associate Editor Lana Ruegamer, who was seeking assistance in making the magazine's indexes available and searchable over the Web.  Work commenced on the project in fall 2000.  During the 2000-2001 academic year, most of the work on the project consisted of marking up the index with a simple XML vocabulary.  Portions of the index were already in electronic form, but much of it had to be scanned from print sources and processed with OCR software before being marked up.  In the fall of 2001, we worked on implementing the web interface and the index was made publicly available in November 2001 and announced at the November meeting of the Indiana Historical Society.  The yearly indexes from 1980 to 2000 are currently available on the web.  The 25-year index covering 1955-1979 has been marked up and will be available on the web in the spring of 2002.  Work continues on scanning, processing, and marking up the two additional 25-year indexes covering the years 1905-1954.

<P><B>Wright American Fiction Project </b><BR>
Indiana University has taken the lead in a CIC (the Big 10 plus the University of Chicago) project to digitize a collection of American fiction based upon Lyle Wright's bibliography American Fiction, 1851-1875. We outsourced digitization of the microfilm collection, and page images for all 2,844 titles have been digitized. Approximately two-thirds of these titles have been converted to text files, with the conversion to be completed by September 2002.  Perry Willett held three training workshop for library staff wanting to learn to encode text for the project.  Approximately 155 texts have been completely proofread and encoded to date, and more will be added continuously.  We have acquired a new Linux server and installed DLXS software from the University of Michigan.  We anticipate the first release of the web site in mid January 2002, with 155 corrected and encoded texts and 1,519 uncorrected texts (page images only).  <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/wright/">http://www.indiana.edu/~letrs/wright/</a>

<P><B>Digital Music Library </b><BR>
In 2000, Indiana University received funding from the National Science Foundation/DLI2 for a project to create a digital music library, with five major research components:  pedagogy, usability, copyright, metadata, and networking.  The project will run four years, from October 1, 2000-September 30, 2004.  For progress reports on the many aspects of the project, see the project web site.  Gerry Bernbom and Jon Dunn reported on the project at the Digital Library Federation Forum in Chicago on November 19, 2000; their Powerpoint presentation is available on the DLF web site: <a href="/forums/fall00/dunn_files/frame.htm">http://www.diglib.org/forums/fall00/dunn_files/frame.htm</a>

 <P><B>Charles W. Cushman Project </b><BR>
 In 2000, we received a two-year grant from IMLS to digitize and offer on the web  approximately 15,000 Kodachrome slides (1938-1967), the work of amateur photographer Charles Cushman.  We contracted with Luna Imaging to digitize the slides.  Digitizing has nearly been completed; the final rescans were sent out in early January, to be completed by early February 2002. Mr. Cushman recorded meticulous detail about each image in small notebooks and on the slide mounts.  This information has been entered into a database that will be used to create an EAD finding aid.  Catalogers have begun adding descriptors from the <I>Thesaurus of Graphical Materials</I>.   The notebooks themselves have been digitized in the Digital Media and Image Center and will be made available on the project web site. Members of the Web Committee created several site mockups. After choosing a general "look and feel" for the site, two navigation prototypes were created and put through user testing. As a result of this testing, elements from each of the two prototypes were chosen for inclusion in the working site prototypes.

<P><B>U.S. Steel Project </b><BR>
We received funding from the Indiana State Library/LSTA to digitize the 2,200 photographs in the U.S. Steel Photograph Collection in the Calumet Regional Archive at IU Northwest in Gary.  The project was funded July 1, 2000-December 31, 2001.  In addition to the photographs, numerous articles and other full-text resources have been digitized and OCR-ed. Page images are also available in PDF and DjVu formats., to provide context for the photographs.  Three teachers (upper elementary, middle school, and high school) hired for the project wrote lesson plans and learning activities to accompany the images and texts. We developed a list of descriptors from the Library of Congress <I>Thesaurus of Graphical Materials</I> to use in cataloging the images.  A cataloger and the archivist from the Calumet Regional Archive used these descriptors to enhance the finding aid.

<P><B>Letopis' Zhurnal'nykh Statei </b><BR>
 We received a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Year 3 of the project began October 1.  We changed procedures on the project, deciding to outsource all of the proofreading to a company with a Russian operation.  All encoding will now be automated using a Java program.  We have also selected our Unicode compliant XML search-engine, and have a working test database with data for 1956-1960. We are currently doing usability testing of the search-engine and the mockup of the user interface. We are also working with the software vendor to add additional functionality to the search-engine. 
 
<P>Project Manager Andy Spencer presented a paper on the some of the technological challenges encountered and solved in the course of the project.  This paper was presented at the <I>Fifth European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries</I>, which was held in Darmstadt, Germany, September 4-9, 2001. The paper was entitled "Digitization,Coded Character Sets and Optical Character Recognition for Multi-script Information Resources." It was published as part of the conference proceedings, both in electronic and paper form, by Springer-Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.                                       
 
<P><B>TEI Consortium </b><BR>
Indiana University has joined the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium, becoming one of its Founding Members.  Perry Willett was elected to the Advisory Council of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium for 2002-2004, which will hold its first meeting in London on January 12, 2002. More on the TEI-Consortium can be found at its website at <a href="http://www.tei-c.org">http://www.tei-c.org</a>.
