<P><B>Contemporary African Artists Database</b><br>
This database is the result of a Rockefeller and Ford Foundation funded initiative designed to document and disseminate contemporary African art, as well as promote networking between African artists and art institutions.  The computerized database will also be used to generate a series of bio-bibliographic dictionaries. The database is classified by country and will include artists who have been working since the 1920's, in addition to important artists from earlier dates. Both database and printed volumes will include sections on public and private art museums, galleries, archives, collections, art schools, and other resources relevant to each country. In conjunction with Salah Hassan, Associate Professor in Africana Studies and the History of Art departments at Cornell University, and the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library, Cornell Institute for Digital Collections (CIDC) is providing infrastructure and systems support for the Contemporary African Artists Database (CAAD) project. CIDC staff developed a database that is used to organize and characterize information about the artists, such as artistic genre and media, nationality, and exhibitions. The contemporary African artists database is accessible via the web for searching.  In addition, authorized users can update and add to the database via the web site. CIDC has linked up to five representative images to the database record for each artist, thus providing a sample of the artist's work.

<P><B>Workplace Issues Today</b><br>
The Martin P. Catherwood Library at Cornell's School of Industrial & Labor Relations established Workplace Issues Today (WIT) in 1999 as a selective news center where faculty, students and interested public could go for the late breaking news on workplace issues. All news items are placed in a searchable archive in the hope that it can represent, in an abbreviated form, a chronology of workplace issues of major concern to the public. In addition, it should give some guidance to the researcher about the who, what, when, where, and how of the workplace over time. One can subscribe to the free e-mail service and get vital news about the workplace delivered to the desktop. WIT is published Monday through Friday mornings, except University holidays. Access is free to the public.

<P><B>Digital Photographic Services</b><br>
The Cornell Institute for Digital Collections offers a range of digital photographic services to Cornell University Library units, including digital photography using a PowerPhase One digital camera on a ZBE Satellite copy stand, as well as flat bed, slide, and transparency scanning.  Items that are not suitable for flatbed scanning because they are fragile, oversized, or warped are good candidates for digital photography.  Some of the work currently underway includes the AD White Architectural photograph collection (<a href=" http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/adw/adw.asp">http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/adw/adw.asp</a>), pages from Petrach manuscripts and books, maps, and small artifacts.
 
<P><B>Electronic Document Delivery (EDD) </b><br>
EDD provides digital copies of journal articles or table of contents from materials in the Cornell University Library's off-site storage facility, the Library Annex. The digital copies are made available on a Library Web server for two weeks in the Adobe PDF format. The hardware component of this service consists of a 333 MHz Pentium II PC with an Minolta IMAX 500 imaging card and a standard ethernet card, a Minolta PS 3000 publication scanner, a Minolta MS 3000 microform scanner, a medium-volume laser printer, and a Canon 9000 fax machine. The PS 3000 is an inverted planetary (overhead) scanner that allows bound volumes to lay face up while scanning, thus providing greater convenience and speed for the operator and reducing physical stress on the volume. Software includes the Epic 3000 and the Microdax 3000 programs, (designed for use with the PS 3000 and MS 3000, respectively), as well as Adobe Acrobat for converting files from the TIFF format to PDF.  Several custom scripts and shareware programs have been integrated to streamline the Annex staff's workflow. Eudora e-mail software is used to receive web form requests. A pilot project for campus wide EDD is planned for Spring 2002. Using the ILLiad system, Mann and Olin/Kroch/Uris Libraries will mount a pilot project with a campus wide implementation planned for Summer 2002. <BR><a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuaccess/annex/edd/">http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuaccess/annex/edd/</a>
 
<P><B>Electronic Reserves (E-reserve) </b><br>
The electronic reserve system is a service that uses the latest in image scanning technology to provide electronic document delivery. The system allows students to find, view and print course materials that have been placed on reserve by instructors. Materials in the electronic reserve system include journal articles, exams, course syllabi, problem sets and other materials.  Material may be retrieved by searching by instructor name, course title and number, author, or title of the material.  Using the Endeavor Image Server client, a campus wide electronic reserve system, which will allows Cornell students to access course reserve materials via the Web, was implemented in all Cornell Libraries at the beginning of the Fall 2001 semester. E-reserve materials were viewed over 81,000 times during the course of the fall semester.

<P><B>Loaner Laptops</b><br>
Over the past few years, several units have offered loaner laptops to their patrons including Mann Library, the Hotel Library and the Engineering Library.  Beginning Fall 2001, the loaner laptop services have been expanded by adding 30 wireless enabled laptops in Olin and Uris Libraries, and several more in the Physical Sciences Library and the Math Library.  The loaner laptop services throughout the library system have proved to be very popular, and are enhanced by the new RedRover wireless system now in place, as well as by the expanded Net-Print public printing offerings.  Demand in Olin and Uris Libraries for loaner laptops regularly outstrips supply even though a large number of high quality sit-down public productivity computers have been deployed, which were themselves similarly saturated with demand.
 
<P><B>Mann Library Table of Contents Service</b><br>
Members of the Cornell University community can sign up to receive by e-mail the tables of contents of one or more of the 285 journals housed in the periodical reading room in the Albert R.

<P><B>Music Listening Stations</b><br>
The Music Library's reserve music listening is available through networked, digital streaming technology.  Access is provided through state-of-the-art computers, on a fast dedicated network, in a listening lab located in the Music Library in Lincoln Hall.  Reserve music listening required for course work is made available to students through a familiar Web interface, affording a level of control and features not possible using traditional analog media.  Future developments in the enforcement of copyright concerns may enable the Library's music listening reserves to be made available to authorized listeners in their dorms, apartments and offices.
 
<P><B>MyLibrary</b><br>
MyLibrary is an initiative to provide personalized library services to Cornell University students, faculty, and staff.  Currently it consists of MyLinks and MyUpdates.  MyLinks is a tool for collecting and organizing resources for private use by a patron.  These resources may or may not be "official" Cornell University Library resources.  Our patrons best understand this service as a "traveling set of bookmarks." MyUpdates is a tool to help scholars stay informed of new resources provided by the library.  MyUpdates periodically queries the Library catalog to determine which resources are new and automatically notifies Cornell students, faculty, and staff via e-mail when books, recordings, networked resources and other library materials in the user's self-identified area of interest are cataloged and available in the library.  The next module to be added will be MyContents (see 'Projects').  Following are the URLs for MyLibrary and for a more in-depth description of the service:

<P><B>Net-Print Public Printing</b><br>
New this Fall 2001, Cornell University Library implemented the Net-Print service throughout the endowed libraries, which uses Cornell-proprietary technology managed by Cornell Information Technologies (CIT).  Using Net-Print, use of public printers is charged back automatically to Cornell community members holding valid accounts, and printout can be sent to any of the 82 printers across Cornell.  All endowed library units received high quality networked laser printers in their public areas, with a total of 13 black and white printers and one color laser printer.   This implementation strategically met the dramatic increase in printing demands as student patrons shifted from photocopying traditional reserve materials to printing on-line PDF files from a new E-reserve service (see above).  Over 170,000 pages where printed in the Fall 2001 semester off 13 black and white printers.  Some debit card-based systems (VendaCard) have been retained to meet the needs of non-Cornell community members.  The ease of use of the Net-Print system, and its quality output, is allowing for a substantial reduction in the number of free citation-only dot-matrix printers available to the public.

<P><B>A. D. White Collection of Architectural Photographs </b><br>
The Andrew Dickson White Architectural Photographs document a wide range of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture of Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, including structures, panoramas and habitats that have vanished due to wars and urban development. The images also represent the work of important photographers, such as William James Stillman, the Bisson Frères, Felix Bonfils and Edouard-Denis Baldus. The collection has received substantive curatorial attention and conservation treatment since September, 1999, when it was awarded a grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation. The 13,000 photographs that comprise the A. D. White Photographs Collection are now being catalogued and digitized and offered to the public via Luna Insight's Browser Insight(r) II software. The project is a collaboration of the Department of Preservation & Conservation, the Cornell Institute for Digital Collections and the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.

<P><B>AgMaps</b><br>
Mann Library has developed a system that converts raw statistical data with a geographic component into a database structure, and then extracts the data so it can be rendered in a variety of map formats. In the present pilot phase of the system, AgMaps covers crop data provided by Mann's USDA Economics and Statistical System (ESS).  For example, with AgMaps a user can establish search criteria that queries a data file in the ESS and returns results showing total yield of wheat in select counties of New York State.  The user can then display the results in three different ways: as a simple web page, a data format that can be used in a spreadsheet, or a thematic map of the state with a color-coded classification system for each county.
 
<P><B>Central Depository for Digital Collections</b><br>
Cornell University Library has produced the first of a two-part report on depository guidelines for digital image materials. This work has been funded in part by the Institute for Museum and Library Services. The first section outlines requirements for those wishing to transfer digital image
resources to the central depository, and covers selection criteria, legal issues, technical imaging requirements, metadata, and storage (<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/imls/">http://www.library.cornell.edu/imls/</a>).  A research team, with the assistance of an advisory committee, is now working to develop a detailed description of the role, responsibilities, and resources required to establish the Depository itself.  They plan to have this report by early spring 2002. 
 
<P><B>Claire Holt Collection</b><br>
The Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections has digitized 1,733 slides from the Claire Holt Collection.  Claire Holt, a specialist in Indonesian culture, was a feature writer and art critic for the <I>New York World</I>.  In the 1930s, she traveled to Bali, where she studied and became an expert on Balinese dance, working with Margaret Mead and other anthropologists, archaeologists, and cultural historians. She came to Cornell in 1954 as a Senior Research Associate in the Southeast Asia Program.  She continued to do field work in Indonesia, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation.  In 1967, she published <I>Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change</I>, introducing readers to the infinite varieties of Indonesian art, both past and present. The collection includes slides of Indonesia created for the Indonesian Arts Project.  Subjects include art, architecture, ceremonies, landscapes, paintings, people, sculpture, textiles, and theatre.  Many of them provide visual documentation for Holt's detailed notebooks of her trips to Indonesia, and portray artwork that may no longer be available in the original.  The scanning for this project is completed; we expect to have the images available for viewing by the end of February, 2002.
 
<P><B>Cooperative Digital Reference Service Project </b><br>

<P><B>Core Historical Literature of Home Economics (CHLHE) </b><br>
Funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (2000 National Leadership Grants for Libraries, Preservation or Digitization Awards), this two-year project will digitize the core historical literature of home economics.  CHLHE will be a core electronic collection of texts on home economics published between the mid-nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century. Full-text materials will cover applied arts and design, food and nutrition, home economics, housing, furnishings and equipment, hygiene, retail studies (consumer studies), clothing and textiles, home management, child care/human development/the family, and institutional management. Scholars are selecting titles for this collection based on their historical importance.   In the course of the project, the team will also explore integration with the Library's online catalog and interoperability with existing digital repositories at Cornell and define a set of model workflows for digital conversion and for capturing metadata for access and preservation of digital materials. The first material will be available in 2002.

<P><B>Cornell Genomics Initiative</b><br>
In support of an interdepartmental initiative to advance genomics research at Cornell, Mann Library is developing a federated thesaurus for a genomics digital library portal. The thesaurus will facilitate the discovery and retrieval of a wide range of genomics-related resources from Cornell and beyond. It brings together into a single database over 229,000 terms relevant to genomics, the life sciences, and agriculture from four leading controlled vocabularies (the National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings, the National Agriculture Library Agricultural Thesaurus, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's Agrovoc thesaurus, and the Gene Ontology Consortium databases.) The independent structural hierarchies and relationships of each source thesaurus have been retained even as individual common terms have been combined, allowing users to assess the acceptance of a term and navigate easily through any one or all four source thesauri. Mann's thesaurus focuses on the human user's need to move from non-preferred entry terms to the appropriate controlled vocabulary, follow consistent navigation pathways to broader, narrower, or related terms, and link directly to the source of a term, to online resources such as PubMed and the European Bioinformatics Institute, and to resources associated locally with the genomics digital library portal.  When the portal is implemented as a distributed model following Open Archives Initiative protocols, the federated thesaurus will serve as the source for self-coding resources that are submitted to the portal by individual and departments at Cornell and elsewhere.
 
<P><B>Cornell Institute for Digital Collections (CIDC) </b><br>
CIDC is a cross-disciplinary team established to explore the use of emerging technologies in providing greater access to cultural and scientific collections.

<P><B>Developing Digital Libraries Information Web Site</b><br>
The goal of the Developing Digital Libraries Information Web Site is to provide a valuable informational and educational resource to librarians and archivists at institutions just beginning to think about digital library development.  Supported by Endeavor Information Systems Inc. and based upon the content recommendation of Cornell's digital library experts in preservation, archival science, metadata, scanning and digitizing, intellectual property rights, and systems, a Web site is being designed and developed that will provide the information necessary for institutions to get off the ground with their own digital library projects and programs.  The site will contain both information and links to further resources on all aspects of digital libraries.
 
<P><B>Development of a Distributed Digital Library of Mathematical Monographs</b><br>
This collaborative project of the University of Michigan Library, Cornell University Library and the State and University Library Gottingen was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.  A realistic interoperable mechanism capable of unifying a single type of resource (retrodigitized books) within a single discipline (mathematics) across multiple access systems at multiple institutions will be developed over the course of the project.  After a thorough evaluation of the effects and benefits, the system, if successful, will be maintained by the three libraries to allow users to access and exploit these collections in a new and more efficient way.
 
<P><B>Digitization Service</b><br>
With increasing demand from researchers and with the recent installation of a high-resolution digital camera within the Library, a feasibility study researching the need for and methods of providing an on-demand scanning service campus-wide was conducted.

<P><B>National Science Digital Library (NSDL) Project </b><br>
The NSDL is a broad program to build a digital library for education in science, mathematics, engineering and technology.  It is funded by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Division of Undergraduate Education.  In summer 2000, Cornell received one of six one-year Core Integration demonstration projects; the task of Core Integration is to ensure that the NSDL is a single, coherent library, not simply a set of unrelated tasks.  Cornell's demonstration project is known as Site for Science.  In late 2001, the NSF consolidated the Core Integration funding into a single grant for the production release of NSDL.  This grant was made to a collaboration of the University Center for Atmospheric Research, Columbia University, and Cornell University.  The technical approach that is being followed is based heavily on the experience with Site for Science.  The NSDL Project is a collaborative project between Cornell University Library and Cornell's Department of Computer Science.

The goal of Project Harvest is to develop a model for permanent e-journal archives to ensure the availability of these important scholarly publications for the future generations.  The first phase of the project will involve setting up a pilot archives composed of agricultural journals.

<P><B>Project Prism</b><br>
Funded by a DLI2 grant, Project Prism is a four-year collaborative effort between the Cornell University Library and Cornell's Computer Science Department to investigate and develop policies and mechanisms needed for information integrity in the context of a distributed, component-based library architecture.  The key research areas include long term survivability of digital information, reliability of information resources and services, interoperability, security (the privacy rights of users of information and the intellectual property rights of content creators), and metadata that makes it possible to ensure information integrity in digital libraries.  Project Prism is working on developing a preservation risk management program for Web resources.

<P><B>Projecting America</b><br>
Projecting America is a major digital initiative supported by the Office of the Provost, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. The aim of this broad-based collaboration is to provide the Cornell community with access to 10,000 digital images representing American visual and material culture of all periods.  The primary audience for the project is comprised of faculty members in Colleges across the University who regularly incorporate images into the classroom experience. The estimated duration of the project is two years.  CIDC is providing advice on creating and cataloging the digital resources, and will provide the shared technical infrastructure for the project (utilizing resources acquired for the Museum project).

<P><B>Samuel May Anti-Slavery Collection</b><br>
The Samuel May Anti-Slavery Collection gathers together over 8,500 of the important pamphlet and leaflets relating to the anti-slavery struggle at the local, regional, and national levels. Many represent the original copies held in the personal libraries of the movement's leaders. Sermons, position papers, off-prints, local Anti-Slavery Society newsletters, poetry anthologies, Freedmen's testimonies, broadsides, and Anti-Slavery Fair keepsakes all document in an intimate manner the social and political implications of the movement.  Supported by  the federal Save America's Treasures program, Cornell has cataloged and is digitizing all items (300,000 pages) in a manner that protects the originals while ensuring full capture of the text, illustrations, annotations, markings, and embossments. The electronic surrogates will be made broadly and comprehensively available via the World Wide Web through the ENCompass development project. Full conservation treatment is restoring these items to a useable state for current and future scholars requiring access to the original artifacts.

<h2><a name="sec3"></a>III. Specific digital library challenges</h2>
<DIR>
<P><B>Establish a suite of services to support faculty development of digital resources: digitization, copyright, metadata, and technology consulting. </b><br>
As libraries increasingly become places where content (especially of the digital variety) is created and not just stored, we find that the services we need to provide are more writer-centered as opposed to reader-centered.  Services that the Cornell University Library is positioning itself to provide to its users include copyright, metadata, digitization, and technology consultation.  
 
<P><B>Establish a central depository and preservation service for digital image collections. </b><br>
Cornell University Library has produced the first of a two-part report on depository guidelines for digital image materials.  The first section outlines requirements for those wishing to transfer digital image resources to the central depository, and covers selection criteria, legal issues, technical imaging requirements, metadata, and storage (http://www.library.cornell.edu/imls/).  A research team, with the assistance of an advisory committee, is now working to develop a detailed description of the role, responsibilities, and resources required to establish the Depository itself.  The establishment of a central depository is a major preservation service goal of the Cornell University Library for 2002.
 
<P><B>Implement the ENCompass digital library management system. </b><br>
Cornell University Library will continue to participate as a development partner with Endeavor Information Systems over the course of the next year to implement significant modules in areas of access and management of licensed resources, access to archival finding aids, and system-wide metadata integration for discovery and searching.
 
<P><B>Administratively reorganize the Library and implement an overarching Master Plan. </b><br>
Cornell University Library has recently undergone an organizational restructuring and a working group has been addressing a renovation plan for its central system libraries, Olin and Uris.  In addition, the Library staff and management team have been undertaking the creation of a Master Plan that will guide its activities in the coming years.  The digital library division is seeking an integration of all of its systems staff and, with central reorganization, has recently assumed direction of the Library's Office of Distributed Learning.  This office will be aiming to establish broader digital library technology education programs for external constituencies and staff.
 
<P><B>Continue to evolve both wireless and wired networking programs. </b><br>
The Library will aim to continue a major implementation of wireless networking within the Library that was begun in the past year.  In addition, it will be evaluating new wired technologies such as the Sun Ray implementation that is currently being installed in Olin Library for possible implementation in other units/sites.  In the public printing arena, the Net-Print service serves explicit Cornell community members only and non-Cornell community members needs using more cumbersome services such as VendaCard printing.  A more efficient, effective print service for these patrons must be addressed.  Also, free citation-only printing needs to be evaluated.   In public computing,  we are witnessing a transition from offering patrons traditional, inexpensive OPACs (Online Public Access Computers) geared towards short term use which where "locked down" towards full-service "open" computers resembling the computing environment patrons may have (or wished they had!) at home.  Patrons expect to be able to have access to facilities that allow for efficient and effective collection, synthesis and creation capabilities within the digital realm while visiting within the library's walls.  Therefore, new public computers sport DVD and/or CD-RW drives, as well as fast process, lots of memory and basic office productivity applications.  Public computers are also now not just stationary, but an increased number are loaner laptops that are regularly all being used.  Service such as RedRover wireless may encourage patrons to bring their own computing device.
 
<P><B>Address the challenge of managing and distributing access to digital sound and moving images in a comparable manner to our current support for text-based materials. </b><br>
We retain this from our previous report as an on-going challenge.  The steadily increasing size of sound and video collections (e.g., the digital video collection currently being developed by the Vet Library or music listening stations developed at the Music Library) presents storage, processing, and distribution challenges.  Such collections are rapidly becoming commonplace and central to our digital library developments.  To address this challenge, a Library-wide multimedia implementation team has been assembled.
