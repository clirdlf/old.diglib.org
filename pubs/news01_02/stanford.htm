<dd><b>MouseSite and Douglas Engelbart</b> <br>
MouseSite examines the work and impact of Douglas Engelbart, whose research laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center, at the Stanford Research Institute led to the invention of the computer mouse and other innovations that shaped personal computing. The site contains a portion of the archival materials in the Douglas C. Engelbart Papers in Stanford University Library's Special Collections, drawn from the period of Engelbart's work at SRI from 1959 through the first public demonstration of the NLS (oNLine System) in 1968. In related resources, Stanford and the Silicon Valley Oral History Interviews presents an interview with Engelbart.  Also, "Englebart's Unfinished Revolution," a December 1998 symposium sponsored by Stanford University and Stanford University Libraries has been archived, including video webstreaming.<br>

<dd><b>Science and Technology in the Making</b> <br>
Although many faculty members make increasing use of the World Wide Web for teaching, it is less frequently used for primary research. Science and Technology in the Making (STIM), a project supported by a two-year grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, did exactly that by opening up new possibilities for historical research over the Internet. The participating primary investigators from Stanford, University of California at Los Angeles, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, and University of California at Berkeley are interested in finding out if, and to what degree, Web-mediated scholarship is possible. Tim Lenoir, Professor of History at Stanford, organized the original grant in collaboration with Henry Lowood, Curator of the Libraries' History of Science & Technology Collections. Lenoir understood the importance of using Web technologies and recognized that the project should reside in the Stanford University Libraries/Academic Information Resources (SUL/AIR) to ensure both its longevity and its usefulness to future researchers. SUL/AIR provides project coordination, and editorial and technical support for all five participants.<br>

<h3>B. Services</h3>

<dl>
<dd><b>Geographic Information Systems</b> <br>
Stanford University's Branner Earth Sciences Library provides access, and supporting reference, research consultation, and instruction for current faculty, students, and staff to geospatial data, digital map services, and Geographic Information Systems.   Available GIS datasets are listed  on the Web by region and category. 
<p>At Branner's GIS facility, patrons can:  <ul>
<li>Create, modify, and print custom maps by using commercial GIS packages and data supplied by vendors or the patron.
<li>Communicate research and project results by creating maps and charts for use in journal articles, term papers and theses.
<li>Analyze data graphically by conducting "what-if" scenarios.
<li>Access a rich collection of databases that provide both geospatial boundary and statistical information (e.g. census, environmental, geological, political, etc).<p></ul>

<dd><b>Humanities Digital Information Service</b> <br>
The primary purpose of Stanford's Humanities Digital Information Service is to provide electronic access to humanities texts for research and teaching.  With the reopening of Green Library's Bing Wing in late 1999, HDIS offers both virtual and in-person services.  In the Lane Reading Room of Green Library, HDIS sponsors workstations with specialized software to use for text analysis, concordancing, and other computer applications for humanists.  The Web site lists collections available for full text searching, either through Stanford's own Hugo program or through various programs offered by commercial vendors.<br>

<dd><b>Social Sciences Data Service</b>  <br>
The Social Sciences Data Service is a program supporting the acquisition and use of computerized social science numeric data at Stanford.   With the reopening of Green Library's Bing Wing in late 1999, the established virtual services of SSDS were augmented by new physical space, including Data Extraction Workstations.   In-person consulting services are available for data acquisition and use, and for questions on the use of various statistical packages such as SPSS, SAS, Stata, and others.  SSDS brings together numeric social science resources from a variety of providers, including U.S. government agencies, international organizations, membership consortia such as ICPSR and the Roper Center, and commercial publishers. <br>

<dl>
<DD><B>E-Journal Use Behavior Study</b> <br>
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded a grant to Stanford University Libraries for a two-year study of people's behavior with and attitudes toward electronic journals. The study will  focus on e-journals mounted on the Internet by HighWire Press, the Libraries' online service bureau for scholarly publishers, and it will also cover the broader issues related to scholarly communication and e-journal use.  The project research will involve a series of ethnographic interviews, online surveys, telephone or mail surveys and data analyses to investigate how e-journals serve scholarly communication now and in the near future and how changes to e-journals may improve scholarly communication. Stanford will engage the Institute for the Future in developing and conducting interview and survey vehicles. The project will also employ data-mining techniques to uncover behavioral and trend data from the transaction logs maintained by HighWire.<br>

<dd><b>Digital Delivery of Interlibrary Loan</b> <br>
Stanford University Libraries' Digital Delivery of Interlibrary Loan Service, supported by the California State Library by a grant offered under the Library Services and Technology Act, is an experimental service through which Interlibrary Loan patrons are offered digital versions of out-of-copyright monographs. Often these are materials that would ordinarily not circulate from the Stanford Libraries.  A revised Web page and user interface is coming in late 2000.  <br>

<dd><b>Data Extraction Web Interface (DEWI)</b> <br>
A new Web interface for finding and extracting variables from the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (and 1992 and 1994 follow-up surveys), Schools and Staffing Surveys, and Teacher Follow-Up Surveys  (with other datasets forthcoming) has been developed by the Social Sciences Data Service. It is currently limited to Stanford users, but more information can be requested from <a href="mailto:ronbo@leland.stanford.edu">Ron Nakao</a> of the Social Sciences Data Service. <br>

<p>

<dd><b>LOCKSS</b> <br>
LOCKSS (Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) is a system prototype to preserve access to scientific journals published on the Web. LOCKSS models how libraries provide access to paper content by allowing individual libraries to safeguard their communities' access to Web content. The system ensures that hyperlinks continue to resolve and appropriate content is delivered, even when in the Internet the links don't work and content is no longer available. Libraries running LOCKSS cooperate to detect and repair preservation failures. 
<p>The project is  funded by the National Science Foundation, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and Stanford University.  Information about project status, including alpha and beta test sites, and contact information is available at the LOCKSS site.<br>
