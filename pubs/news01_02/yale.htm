<p>

<dd><b>Archives 300</b> <br>
The Archives 300 program was created to coincide with Yale's tricentennial.  Its mission is to establish ongoing mechanisms for the selection and preservation of primary source materials about Yale's history, provide comprehensive and effective description and access to the Yale documentary record and implement and participate in programs to promote the study and appreciation of the history, accomplishments, and contributions of the University and the Yale community.  Among the digital aspects of the Archives 300 program are databases created to clarify Yale's historical organizational structure and an online component of an exhibit on Yale architecture.<br>

<p>
<dd><b>Avalon Project</b> <br>
The Avalon Project, a collaboration between the Yale Law School and Yale Law Library, makes historical and present day legal documents available online.  This international collection focuses primarily on modern documents but contains some documents from before the 18th century.  There are currently 3,500 documents available.  Documents are available in full text with supporting documentation linked where appropriate.  <br>

<p>
<dd><b>Imaging America Project</b> <br>
The Yale University Library is creating over three years a database of c. 25,000 digital images to support teaching, learning, and research in American Studies. Since the initial organizational meeting in April 1999, a number of institutions have expressed a keen interest in participating.  Exploration of candidate collections has proceeded in tandem with an active search for foundation support; ongoing discussions with the American Studies Association regarding sponsorship and collaboration; local implementation of the Luna Imaging software; and integration of materials from Yale's own library and museum collections.  The Luna software is being tested in the classroom during the 2000/2001 academic year by several American Studies faculty.<br>

<p>
<dd><b>Beinecke Photonegatives Database</b> <br>
The Beinecke Photonegatives Database contains approximately 19,000 images of photographs, manuscripts, correspondence, artwork, objects, and illustrations and selected pages from printed works in the Beinecke's collections. The images were scanned from the Photonegative File, a file containing negatives and color transparencies of images selected for reproduction or study by patrons over the last twenty years. Data describing these images in most cases is very brief but generally includes call number and subject or author.

<p>
<dd><b>American Drawings Database</b>  <br>
The Beinecke's American Drawings Database contains information about more than 2200 original sketches, drawings and watercolors by or about America. The information in the records was compiled by the staff of the Yale University Art Gallery's "American Drawings and Watercolors Project" in the mid-1980s. The database has not been added to since that time, but it represents the most complete survey such material at the Beinecke ever undertaken and includes much information not found in ORBIS.<br>

<p>
<dd><b>Western Americana Filmscript Collection Database</b> <br>
The Western Americana Filmscript Collection Database contains information about more than 430 Western movie scripts in the Yale Collection of Western Americana at the Beinecke Library. The records include information about script titles, authors, the directors, producers, production companies, actors and distributors associated with the films, with dates and settings as well as shelf locations. The script collection is described in ORBIS under the title "Western filmscript collection" (WA MSS S-1610), and a preliminary finding aid is available at the Beinecke Library, but the database provides the ability to employ boolean search operators across fields of data to isolate relevant scripts.<br>

<dd><b>Involvement with ICOLC</b> <br>
Yale is an active participant in and one of the early advocates of the need for the International Consortium of Library Consortia (ICOLC). This group of nearly 150 library consortia facilitates discussion among consortia on issues of common interest including keeping participating consortia informed about new electronic information resources, pricing practices of electronic providers and vendors, and other issues of importance to directors and governing boards of consortia including the development of license agreements that are advantageous, fair and affordable to the library and user communities.  The Yale Library keeps the record of the ICOLC meetings and maintains the public web site.<br>

<h3>B.  Services</h3>

<dl>
<dd><b>Borrow Direct Pilot Project</b> <br>
Yale is working with Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania on the Borrow Direct project, a trial book borrowing system between the three universities' libraries. The Borrow Direct system allows Yale readers to request loans from our two partners for books not owned, checked out, or otherwise unavailable at Yale.  Book pickup can be designated to be at one of several Yale libraries.  Most books can be picked up four working days after a request is made.  Participation in this project will help to develop long-term document delivery strategies at the Yale libraries.<br>
<a href="http://borrowdirect.library.yale.edu/">http://borrowdirect.library.yale.edu/</a>.
<p>

<dd><b>Online Instruction Tutorials</b> <br>
Many Yale libraries and collections have created self-guided tutorials and online subject and help guides to assist readers in research.  This effort allows librarians to explore new methods of digital outreach and instruction and to serve our readers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  In addition to the many subject-tailored or resource-specific tutorials available, a small but growing number of tutorials and guides have been developed cooperatively by Yale librarians to provide basic information about core research resources.<br>
<a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/instruction/tutorials.html">http://www.library.yale.edu/instruction/tutorials.html</a>.
<p>

<dd><b>Science Expert Help System</b>  <br>
The Yale University Science Libraries have implemented a Navigator system, designed by David Stern (Director of Science Libraries and Information Services), which helps users determine - and in many cases transparently link to - the most appropriate source for their information need(s) in the sciences. This approach begins with the type of information desired ... a definition, short description, annual review, the latest information, etc ... and then moves to subject and source determination. It assumes that users have no idea of the plethora of resources available upon entering an information maze. It attempts to identify the best and other relevant sources for a particular need.<br>

<h3>C. Systems</h3>

<dl>
<dd><b>Locally Loaded Databases</b> <br>
Several bibliographic databases and full-text resources are locally loaded at Yale.  At the Medical Library, the loading of Ovid databases and journals provides consistent access to important information.  Chadwyck-Healey full text databases are available from a server supported by the Library Systems Office.  These projects provide important data on usage patterns and allow Yale to tailor services for our users.
<p>
 
<dd><b>Luna Imaging</b>  <br>
Yale has worked closely and successfully with Luna Imaging, Inc. in the development of classroom applications and in the creation of an image database currently containing material from the Imaging America Project, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, and the Yale Visual Resources Collection (6000 records in all).  Through the Luna Users Group, Yale is now working closely with other research institutions on challenges that must be met if the Luna database architecture is to succeed in a networked research environment.  Release 3.0 of the Insight software, scheduled for November, 2000, will deliver a new database structure and several important enhancements requested and refined by the Users Group.<br>

<p>

<dd><b>Non-Roman Workstation Support</b> <br>
The project to enable display of non-Roman characters using Internet Explorer or Netscape on library public workstations resulted in the successful configuration and installation of workstations in most University Libraries.  Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew and Thai are among the languages that now can be displayed correctly on Library public access machines. Input of Chinese, Japanese and Korean is also now possible.

<p>
<dd><b>Library Management System Migration Project</b> <br>
Yale Library's current Library Management System, Orbis, was installed in 1989. The Library Management System Migration (LMS) project is a thirty month endeavor to replace Orbis with the next generation library catalog. Orbis2, the new LMS, has a projected implementation date of June 2002.<br>

<DD><B>LIBLICENSE Project</b> <br>
The LIBLICENSE Project was established to inform and educate members of the information supply chain, particularly (but not exclusively) librarians, about how effectively to contract for electronic information resources. The project supports: (1) the LIBLICENSE web site, (2) the active and ongoing liblicense-l discussion list, and (3) the LIBLICENSE software (available on the Project web site), which publishers, librarians, vendors, and other interested parties can download and use to create and customize their own electronic resources licenses. Creation of, and ongoing enhancements to, the project were made possible by CLIR (the Council on Library and Information Resources) and the Digital Library Federation.<br>

<p>

<dd><b>Personal Digital Assistants at the Medical Library</b> <br>
The Medical library conducted a project on the use of Personal Digital Assistants in the library.  The goal was to see if high-use library and Medical center resources could be efficiently accessed through Palm Pilots and similar small, inexpensive computers.  The result of this study lead to a class now taught to fourth-year medical students on "Personal Information Management" where library staff instruct students on how to use medical information tools on their handheld computers.<br>

<dd><b>BYTES</b> <br>
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has granted $42,000 to the Yale University Library to fund a one-year pilot project that is being conducted by nine of the eighteen members of NERL (the NorthEast Research Libraries consortium).  The project is called BYTES, Books You Teach Every Semester, and grows out of the NERL libraries' desire to exploit and influence effectively the rapidly developing electronic book marketplace, which began clearly to emerge in 1999.  The participating institutions include: Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, New York University, Syracuse University, University of Connecticut, University of Massachusetts, and Yale University.  The investigators will attempt to answer a series of fundamental, policy-shaping questions related to the potential digitization of books and other reading materials that support study and teaching in these areas.<p>
