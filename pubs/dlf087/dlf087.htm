      <blockquote>On May 1, 1995, 16 institutions created the Digital Library Federation (additional partners have since joined the original
         16). The DLF partners have committed themselves to "bring together -- from across the nation and beyond -- digitized materials
         that will be made accessible to students, scholars, and citizens everywhere." If they are to succeed in reaching their goals,
         all DLF participants realize that they must act quickly to build the infrastructure and the institutional capacity to sustain
         digital libraries. In support of DLF participants' efforts to these ends, DLF launched this publication series in 1999 to
         highlight and disseminate critical work.

      <blockquote>With digital information rapidly increasing in amount and availability, the information management community finds itself
         facing a wide-reaching and complex set of challenges. One of the primary challenges is how to manage access to information
         that is sensitive, proprietary, or protected by copyright. Addressing this question requires the attention of
      </blockquote>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>policy makers concerned with questions of privacy and protection of data,</li>
         
         <li>legal experts who draft contracts and licenses whose terms must be implemented through automated systems for authenticating
            users and authorizing access,
         </li>
         
         <li>technologists who design software for controlling electronic use and misuse, and</li>
         
         <li>publishers and librarians, who, as major providers of information, play a central role in striking a balance between protecting
            copyright and enabling access to the record of knowledge.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <blockquote>The workshop described in this report focused on the management of access to published information resources through research
         libraries. Topics discussed include privacy, protection of rights, authorization, and authentication. These are, in fact,
         important issues of concern to all citizens whenever access to information they seek is controlled automatically.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>Among the groups seeking to meet the challenge of access management are the Digital Library Federation (DLF), which consists
         of major research libraries and archives in the United States, the Center for Research on Information Access (CRIA) at Columbia
         University, and the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of the Computers, Information Sciences and Engineering Directorate
         of the National Science Foundation (NSF). On April 6, 1998, they brought together expert practitioners and researchers from
         several disciplines at a workshop, held at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., to explore some of the more pressing
         questions for research libraries, including:
         
         <blockquote>
            <i>How can members of a university that has subscribed to an electronic journal prove that they are authorized to access an article?
               How is a system to confirm that the staff member, professor, or student is not someone else? Are there ways to screen out
               impostors?</i>
            
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            <i>How finely can information providers discriminate among potential users when making their materials available? What criteria
               should universities and public libraries, among other organizations, use to determine who should have access to a database
               of published information, such as the online version of The New York Times? What options do public libraries have to be able
               to authorize the use of licensed materials to the general citizenry that they serve?</i>
            
         </blockquote>

         <blockquote>
            <i>How can authors and other creators of information resources be protected from digital thievery? Is Garrison Keillor correct
               in predicting that authors on the information superhighway will become "the deer in the headlights" of a vast traffic they
               cannot control?<a href="#n1"> [1]</a> What means do custodians have to ensure that the cultural record is accessible but that the proprietary rights of authors
               and creators are protected against widespread copying and redistribution?</i>
            
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
            <i>Should digital data be fitted with a digital lock that can be opened only by users with matching keys? How does such a mechanism
               accord with constitutional and legislative mandates requiring that a balance be struck between the rights of authors and creators
               and citizens' accessibility to the cultural record?</i>
            
         </blockquote> Such questions and the discussions they stimulated led participants to identify five key properties for the design and adoption
         of systems that enable access for users while respecting the rights and interests of authors and publishers.
      </blockquote>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li><i>Simplicity</i>. The less complex a system of access management, the more readily it can be adopted technologically and organizationally,
            and the more acceptable it is to all involved in its implementation.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Privacy</i>. Systems that manage access to the cultural record must protect the privacy of users from detailed tracking and disclosure
            of use. User privacy must not be compromised.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Good faith</i>. Agreements on access to scholarly information rely on trust among the parties involved. Users and providers would each prefer
            to depend, in an access management system that implements
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>-vi-</i></p>
            
            these agreements, on reasonable barriers against abuse rather than complex restrictions that inhibit use.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Trusted intermediaries</i>. Intermediaries play an essential role in providing access to the cultural record as parties trusted by both users and providers
            and as efficient aggregators of distribution and usage. System design must take the role of intermediaries into account.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Reasonable terms</i>. Access management systems and license agreements must recognize the distinction between access and use. Overly tight control
            of access to a resource may impose inappropriate constraints on its use, especially in teaching and research contexts. The
            most useful system will not limit access to specific user groups known in advance to be interested in a resource, but will
            be reasonably open to serving unlikely users whose curiosity and research interests may lead them in directions not predicted
            by those responsible for making the agreements or designing the systems.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <blockquote>Workshop participants also recommended research and project evaluation in two key areas: ,em&gt;system usability and economic
         models. First, an effort must be made to understand the ways in which users interact with systems, their needs in relation
         to new information types, and the functionality of these types in the emerging digital environment. Second, new standards
         of measure must be found to assess the usage of digital resources and thereby to develop alternative pricing schemes and payment
         mechanisms. Although the conclusions reached at this workshop relate specifically to the problems of managing access to the
         cultural record in digital form for research and teaching purposes, they apply to other realms as well, including business,
         medicine, insurance, credit card transactions, and logfiles from Web browsers, all of which involve more sensitive information.
         Enabling appropriate access to digital information depends on the efforts and talents of many stakeholders: information specialists,
         librarians, publishers, computer scientists, lawyers, scientists, and policymakers, and the general citizenry.

      <p>On April 6, 1998, the Digital Library Federation (DLF) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored a one-day workshop
         on ways to improve systems of managing access to digital information. The workshop was an outgrowth of a two-day meeting sponsored
         by NSF in September 1996 exploring the technology of the terms and conditions for access.<a href="#n2"> [2]</a> The consensus there was that input from a variety of user communities was required to develop formal mechanisms for implementing
         terms and conditions within digital libraries. This DLF-NSF workshop was convened to provide input from research libraries
         with a focus on requirements for access management systems that can be designed and deployed in today's technical, legal,
         and economic environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>Workshop conveners Judith Klavans, director of Columbia University's Center for Research on Information Access, and Donald
         Waters, director of the Digital Library Federation, invited experts from the fields of computer science, library technology,
         publishing, information technology, and to exchange ideas on managing access law (see appendix A for workshop participants).
         Prior to the workshop, they gave the participants a list of suggested readings and asked them to consider two typical scenarios
         faced by research libraries (see appendix B for readings and figure 1 for scenarios). In the first scenario, libraries provide
         digital works to other academic institutions and the public; in the second, they license digital works from publishers or
         publishers' agents. The conveners asked participants to discuss the scenarios from the perspective of both users and providers
         of information as a basis for developing requirements for access management systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>The workshop's objectives were
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>to provide input to the development of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) White Paper on interorganizational access
               management,<a href="#n3"> [3]</a></li>
            
            <li>to identify key research problems for programs such as the NSF's Digital Libraries Initiative and Knowledge and Distributed
               Intelligence program, and
            </li>
            
            <li>to provide a springboard for implementation projects.</li>

         <h2>Summary of the Day's Activities</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the opening statements, Judith Klavans explained the design and goals of the workshop, noting that its primary concern
         was <i>access</i> management rather than rights management, as originally announced. Donald Waters explained that systems for access management
         include two key technical components, <i>authentication</i> and <i>authorization</i>. He noted that the focus of this workshop was on mechanisms for authorization. He outlined issues and options identified
         through a parallel initiative at CNI, the development of a White Paper on Authentication and Access Management Issues in Cross-organizational
         Use of Networked Information Resources. Waters reminded participants that the two scenarios presented in the workshop handout
         should stimulate discussions later in the day.
      </p>
      
      <p>Two invited presentations set the stage for the discussions. Russell Vaught, director of Academic Computing at Penn State
         University, described the enterprise-wide authorization database in use at Penn State. John Erickson, Vice President for Systems
         Development at Yankee Book Peddler, Inc., described the goal of the Rights Metadata Working Group established as part of the
         joint activities of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the International DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
         Foundation. In particular, he presented the conceptual model developed by the group to represent rights transactions and a
         proposed schema for rights operations.
      </p>
      
      <p>Three groups were formed for two breakout sessions. Each group reflected a balance of expertise and was instructed to use
         the same approach, outlined in the handout, to examine the two scenarios. In the first breakout session, they were to consider
         both scenarios from the perspective of users. For the second, their task was to concentrate on the provider's perspective.
         In the event, it proved hard to draw such lines. Perhaps because the challenge is to find a balance between the perspectives,
         the natural instinct was to consider both sides of issues such as security and privacy. At the same time, it was immediately
         apparent that the perspective of the library or institutional user differs markedly from that of the individual end user.
         In view of this complexity, the report summarizes the discussions from a thematic rather than a chronological standpoint.
      </p>
      
      <p>Each breakout was followed by a plenary session at which a representative from each group summarized the discussions. Before
         the final discussion, Peter Jaszi of the Washington College of Law, American University, presented an update on legislative
         activities concerning copyright and related intellectual property rights (<a href="#appendixc">see appendix C</a>).

      <p>As a backdrop for discussion, Judith Klavans highlighted the findings of two previous workshops on topics related to access
         management. The first, a two-day workshop on Technology of Terms and
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-4-</i></p>
         
         Conditions, was held in September 1996. This workshop, which Klavans chaired with Jim Davis of Xerox PARC, was also funded
         by NSF. Roughly 30 participants explored issues from multidisciplinary perspectives. Four breakout groups focused on different
         aspects of the overall problem, covering the following topics: infrastructure requirements and the factors that encourage
         or inhibit acceptance of systems for managing terms and conditions; the technical, political, and social uncertainties that
         prevent the formulation of descriptions of terms and conditions; issues of scale; and ways to express conditions of use.
      </p>
      
      <p>Of the conclusions reached, three in particular gave stimulus to the present workshop:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>publishers vary in their approaches to licensing and the degree of control they wish to retain,</li>
            
            <li>user communities must be involved in design and testing, and</li>
            
            <li>community attitudes and acceptance are of prime importance.</li>
            
         </ul> Other important points raised in September 1996 were that technology must accommodate vagueness and ambiguity; ambiguity
         may be intentional, as a consequence of the legal needs for flexible interpretation; economic pressures push publishers and
         libraries in opposite directions, and legal and technological developments will affect the economic balance; and international
         perspectives must be considered.
      </p>
      
      <p>In December 1996, the Digital Library Federation (then the National Digital Library Federation) and researchers from the six
         projects funded through the first phase of the Digital Libraries Initiative held a joint meeting at Stanford University. A
         discussion of terms and conditions focused on points of disagreement and other issues preventing progress in building systems
         to manage access to information in digital libraries. Participants explored requirements from three perspectives: publishing,
         libraries, and technology. Publishing needs included a link to systems for digital commerce, a legal infrastructure that offered
         protection for digital contents, and technical mechanisms for controlling and describing digital content objects. Libraries
         needed mechanisms for authenticating users and roles, the association of new metadata elements with digital content objects
         to support self-management, and systems that allow for third-party rights. From a technological perspective, it was argued
         that progress would be made by ignoring some complexities, partitioning the problem, and discarding (or deferring) intractable
         parts.
      </p>
      
      <p>The present DLF-NSF workshop, Klavans continued, would undoubtedly contribute to the development of the CNI White Paper. In
         the longer term, the findings would influence ongoing collaborative projects in which participants are engaged and would guide
         the planning and evaluation of access management components of other digital library projects.

         <h3>Donald Waters, Director, Digital Library Federation</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Donald Waters opened with a brief description of the Digital Library Federation, a consortium composed of the Library of Congress,
         the National Archives, the New York Public Library, and sixteen of the nation's large research libraries. This organization
         was formed in 1995 to take the lead in identifying and lowering the barriers to federating digital libraries. One such barrier,
         said Waters, is the lack of adequate systems for access management, particularly for authorization. He emphasized that access
         management entails both authentication and authorization and presented a diagram to illustrate the elements of access management
         (see figure 2). Authentication refers to two distinct processes: verifying the identity of a user and ensuring that content
         is what it purports to be. Authorization ensures that terms and conditions in an agreement are being met by relating roles
         associated with a user to properties of an object.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/pub79fig2.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>Waters asked participants to focus on authorization within the context of access management. Participants could evaluate specific
         scenarios, he suggested, by drawing on the draft CNI White Paper edited by Clifford Lynch, which recommends that the following
         factors be considered in evaluating approaches to access management in universities: <i>granularity</i> or degree of role distinction required, privacy, strength of security, manageability with respect to accountability and ability
         to collect management data, technical feasibility, and affordability.
      </p>
      
      <p>The White Paper identifies three approaches used on campuses to support authentication and facilitate authorization by remote
         information services or resources.

         <ul>
            
            <li>IP source filtering: the institution warrants that traffic from a given set of Internet addresses is legitimate.</li>
            
            <li>Proxies: the institution provides a specific machine through which all traffic to and from a service is routed and ensures
               that only legitimate traffic is permitted.
            </li>
            
            <li>Credentials: each user presents a credential (such as a user ID and password or a digital certificate) to warrant legitimacy.</li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Waters then introduced the two scenarios and specific questions to be addressed in the breakout sessions (see handout reproduced
         as figure 1). The terms <i>authentication</i>, <i>authorization</i>, and others associated with access management are defined in appendix D, compiled from definitions used by Waters and the
         other presenters at this workshop, by the DOI Rights Metadata Working Group, and by Clifford Lynch in the draft CNI White
         Paper.

         <h3><i>Creation of an Authorization Database</i> <br>Russell S. Vaught, Director, Center for Academic Computing, Pennsylvania State University
         </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Russell Vaught described the large multiyear effort at Penn State, a DLF institution, to build central authentication and
         authorization services for a large university with many campuses. The complexities, he pointed out, reach beyond the technical
         aspects of the project to issues of university policy and cost-benefit tradeoffs that affect far more than just the computing
         service organization.
      </p>
      
      <p>Vaught sought to clarify the meaning of <i>authentication</i> and <i>authorization</i>. He pointed out that they are often confused because they are frequently employed together. Users, he noted, can be authenticated
         by something they know (such as an identity code or user ID and password), something they have (such as a SecureID card),
         or something they are (which can be verified, for example, using a retina scan). Authorization grants a user the right to
         use a system or data and usually presupposes authentication of users.
      </p>
      
      <p>In 1992 the centralized Computer and Information Systems (CIS) service installed a distributed file system known as AFS, which
         relied on Kerberos, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), for authentication. AFS was developed at
         Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and in its early stages was known as the Andrew File System (AFS). AFS and Kerberos both
         emerged in the 1980s, the byproducts of large projects dedicated to building campus networks and distributed systems. Kerberos
         provides authentication based on user ID and a password ("something you know"). In the summer of 1993, CIS decided to build
         a central authentication service based on version 4 of Kerberos to support all core computing systems (such as e-mail, dialup
         access, and the use of microcomputer labs). Kerberos is used in conjunction with SecureID cards for administrative
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-7-</i></p>
         
         applications in which the high cost of a security breach justifies the cost of the card (which generates passwords for one-time
         use). The Kerberos database includes 114,500 active principals (user identities); Penn State has 80,000 students and 30,000
         faculty and staff at 24 locations.
      </p>
      
      <p>In mid-1996, CIS decided to provide authorization services that could support more applications. The new system is based on
         the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) Security Services, which uses version 5 of Kerberos for authentication. A cross-organizational
         task group was formed to develop an initial database to control authorization. The new system saw its first application in
         the summer of 1997. It is now being used to support many applications, including a proxy system for access to the remote JSTOR
         archive of scholarly journal literature. Vaught hopes that all systems using the old authentication service will be converted
         by the summer of 1999.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although the system is complex, Vaught finds other options, such as a Public Key Infrastructure, equally complex and perhaps
         less cost effective. Performance and scalability, though still a concern, are expected to improve with the planned enhancements
         to the DCE directory component (and increased network capacity and processing power).

         <h3><i>Reflections on the NISO DOI Rights Metadata Working Group</i> <br>John S. Erickson, Vice President for Rights Technologies, Yankee Rights Management
         </h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>John Erickson began by pointing out that copyright serves both as enabler and as inhibitor, establishing a balance to facilitate
         creativity for the overall benefit of society. His presentation described the current state of thinking of the NISO DOI Rights
         Metadata Working Group, chaired by Sally Morris, of Wiley, U. K., a working group formed to establish a standard rights metadata
         schema to facilitate electronic commerce for information objects (whether in digital or nondigital form). This working group,
         which has very active participation from U.K. publishers, is one of several emerging from a series of joint workshops organized
         by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the International Digital Object Identifier (DOI) Foundation.<a href="#n4"> [4]</a></p>
      
      <p>The DOI system and related activities have developed within the publishing community and until recently, the focus has been
         on making
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-8-</i></p>
         
         money through the enforcement of rights. Erickson believes that the group is beginning to tolerate some degree of fair use
         and the related ambiguity. The joint activities with NISO signal recognition that discussion must be opened up to a broader
         community.
      </p>
      
      <p>The group's stated objective is to develop "a consensus rights transaction model through very active, highly visible public
         discussions and information sharing." The resulting conceptual model is shown in figure 3.<a href="#n5"> [5]</a></p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/pub79fig3.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>In the group's opinion, certain digital property rights languages, such as that proposed by Mark Stefik of Xerox PARC, have
         both advantages and disadvantages and hence alternative models are needed for purposes of comparison and practical evaluation.
         In particular, the group sees a need for a model to express agreements. Their current thinking borrows from approaches used
         by stock photography agencies and is based on the use of decision trees for evaluating permissions. A basic assumption here
         is that any use has a price, even if the price is zero. The model can accommodate a default agreement with standard prices
         for all users for a limited set of operations. Agreements could relate users or classes of users to certain operations on
         (uses of) classes of objects. Owners and administrators of agreements would have to be able to apply templates of operations
         and prices to groups of objects and users.
      </p>
      
      <p>In Erickson's view, it is essential that the gathering of appropriate metadata become part of the publishing workflow. Two
         other important issues have been raised. Who would be accountable for codifying a license agreement and maintaining the data
         that supports access management? And would rights metadata for content be made available to third-party services along with
         descriptive metadata?
      </p>
      
      <p>After Erickson's presentation, Clifford Lynch (CNI) provided some additional context for the activity of the NISO DOI working
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-9-</i></p>
         
         group. In a new approach to standards setting, NISO has sponsored exploratory workshops encouraging broad participation. In
         1997 and early 1998, NISO and the DOI Foundation sponsored a series of joint meetings that addressed the question of whether
         DOI activities should be brought into the regular process for national and international standards. The meetings, the related
         electronic forum, and the five or six working groups they spawned have no formal standing within the national or international
         standards process. They are not intended to be exclusionary and have served a valuable educational role.

         <h2>Discussion of Scenarios</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>The scope of workshop discussions was shaped partly by the facts in the scenarios and the questions asked, but perhaps more
         significantly by the balance of viewpoints inherent in the list of invitees and the experience of the individual participants.
         Most had considerable insight into the perspectives and legal responsibilities of both the users (or institutions acting as
         agents for users) and the providers of information resources. Many had also been involved in the parallel development of the
         CNI white paper and knew that some technical components were being explored in depth through that exercise. At this DLF-NSF
         workshop, they tended to focus on high-level requirements and policy issues, rather than on the technical details of automating
         the terms and conditions of use, which had been the major concern of an earlier NSF workshop. Instead, they concentrated on
         the problems universities and research libraries face today in their capacity as publishers of digital content created at
         their institution and as intermediaries licensing access from publishers and publishers' agents.
      </p>
      
      <p>Participants brought substantial real-world experience to the discussion of the scenarios. Many had participated in the negotiation
         of licenses between libraries and publishers and were familiar with the economic realities that underlie such negotiations
         and with the practical problems of compliance. Others had struggled to establish what rights might pertain to materials in
         archival collections being converted to digital form and fully recognize that converting and making such materials accessible
         entail high costs.
      </p>
      
      <p>The discussion focused on traditional scholarly resources and relations between academic institutions and publishers of scholarly
         materials. The market for such content is limited; little new money will be entering the system in the near term. The challenge
         is to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the electronic environment without "rocking the boat." The market for
         other classes of material, such as works aimed at the business or consumer market, might present very different issues. As
         pointed out in the earlier workshop, however, whatever the framework for managing access to digital works and balancing the
         rights and privileges of user and provider, its success depends on user acceptance. Any system that manages
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-10-</i></p>
         
         access to the growing body of scholarly journal literature that publishers are making available in digital form, for example,
         must be accepted by the higher education community represented at this workshop or be doomed to failure.
      </p>
      
      <p>The scenarios prompted discussions on a wide range of topics beyond the specific questions posed in the instructions for the
         breakout groups. Despite the limitation inherent in a one-day meeting, common themes emerged in the three breakout groups.
         These themes can guide the design and development of prototype systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>This report summarizes the workshop discussions under three thematic headings rather than following the day's agenda. Although
         the discussions did not focus on technical matters, they were certainly built on some assumptions about the technical infrastructure.
         The first section below describes some of these implicit assumptions; they derive primarily from the CNI White Paper. The
         factors that affect user acceptance are drawn together in the second section. The third section extracts points that address
         the specific questions posed for consideration during the breakout sessions. Unanticipated issues that do not fit into these
         categories are described in a fourth and final section.

         <h3>Technical Assumptions</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>A common framework for distributed access management is needed to avoid the proliferation of incompatible mechanisms developed
         to support specific arrangements. This framework must be general enough to support different mechanisms for authenticating
         users and must meet global requirements. It must permit access to be controlled at the level of individual objects (such as
         articles or books), not just at the entrance to a system or service that provides access to a large body of materials.
      </p>
      
      <p>Today the most common method of controlling access is to filter by source address as defined by the Internet Protocol (IP).
         This mechanism is not adequate for the longer term. A limitation of particular concern to participants in this workshop is
         the exclusion of authorized users when they are away from an authorized site. In addition, IP source filtering cannot be applied
         when providing services to the general public or small organizations, such as schools, which may not have permanent IP addresses.
      </p>
      
      <p>Universities need to develop campus-based authentication and authorization schemes for purposes other than access to licensed
         information resources. Authorization systems, such as that described by Russell Vaught in his presentation, are needed to
         control access to grades and other personal records, to charge for dining services or bookstore purchases, to permit entrance
         to libraries and sports facilities, and so on. In many cases, university libraries will be able to build on these capabilities
         to authenticate users and provide credentials acceptable to an access management system. In some cases, a
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-11-</i></p>
         
         library may take a leading role in developing a campus-based authorization scheme.
      </p>
      
      <p>As Donald Waters pointed out in his introduction, the CNI White Paper has identified three approaches to campus-based authentication
         and authorization that can interface with remote access management systems. The first approach is IP source filtering. The
         second is the provision of a gateway or proxy server to which each user must authenticate (typically using an ID and password)
         and through which all interactions with the remote system are transmitted. In the third approach, a campus-based authentication
         or authorization system issues credentials acceptable to the remote system. An important example of a credential is a digital
         certificate, having a data format compatible with Web-based security protocols and used for the distribution of secure information
         over the Internet according to a standard known as X.509. An acceptable access management framework must interface with all
         three mechanisms, since no one solution will be able to serve all campuses.

         <h3>Issues Affecting User Acceptance</h3>
      </center>
      
      <h4><i>Where is the balance between two utopian visions?</i></h4>
      
      <p>Workshop participants observed that two contrasting utopian visions of the future of scholarly communication motivate developments
         in electronic publishing. For many publishers, the technology provides an opportunity to make more money by charging for every
         information use. For researchers, the technology holds the promise of free access to information for all. Librarians recognize
         that the information will not be free, but they seek to provide unfettered access to their users to the extent possible within
         existing budgets.
      </p>
      
      <p>Over the last two or three years, interested parties have attempted to establish new rules of business for digital works with
         voluntary guidelines for fair use. These efforts, such as the Conference on Fair Use,<a href="#n6"> [6]</a> have foundered on the conflicting utopian visions of the parties involved. They have, nevertheless, served to educate all
         communities about the nature of the differences that divide them. Meanwhile, those engaged in private license negotiations
         and consortial arrangements have discovered the powers of the marketplace to forge workable solutions. As one participant
         observed, the longer the library and publishing communities are engaged in these activities, the more rational are the business
         models they adopt and the licenses they negotiate. The requirement for access management systems to allow for the ambiguity
         inherent in the related law also becomes clearer, as does the need for access management even when no fees are charged (for
         instance, to comply with the terms of a gift).
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-12-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Libraries are learning that they can respond to terms and conditions they see as unreasonable with the assistance of market
         forces. As they gain more experience in providing access to electronic resources, they are discovering that most users will
         accept less than the utopian ideal of free access to everything when they understand the underlying business model and find
         it reasonable. Publishers, too, are beginning to see that they are unlikely to earn more revenue from their traditional customer
         base for scholarly journals; furthermore, they recognize that libraries are making an honest attempt to comply with reasonable
         terms but cannot be expected to control or monitor their users' behavior closely. Nor can the lack of a robust means to enforce
         copyright still be blamed for holding back electronic publication of scholarly journals. If anything, their volume is increasing
         so rapidly that academic libraries are having difficulty absorbing them. Although license terms still vary from publisher
         to publisher, the agreements are growing more similar with experience.
      </p>
      
      <p>Workshop participants argued that simple, liberal license agreements of the kind used by JSTOR should be the model for the
         future.<a href="#n7"> [7]</a> Such agreements are clearly less costly to negotiate and implement than others. Licensee institutions should be free to define
         their user community in the agreement and should take responsibility for authenticating their users (and providing credentials
         that certify roles, if necessary). Participants also urged publishers of specialized journals not to limit access to specific
         categories of academic users, as laid out in scenario 2. This practice was seen as a poor business model, since use by community
         members outside the specific group for whom access was purchased was unlikely to be significant. Prototype access management
         systems should operationalize simple agreements, to avoid raising expectations that unreasonable conditions could be enforced.
         Publishers who use simpler business models and offer reasonable license agreements, argued Vicky Reich of HighWire Press and
         Stanford University, are better able to expand into new markets.
      </p>
      
      <p>At the same time, some participants strongly recommended that the academic community continue to press for free access for
         all to the scholarly literature. Such "blue-sky" talk, they said, would offset the commercial pressure for pay-per-view access
         and dampen the ability of publishers to implement access management systems based on that model. They believed other business
         models could be constructed to support the costs of managing and providing access to high-quality scholarly information.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4><i>What perspectives are needed?</i></h4>
      
      <p>Participants were instructed to consider the two scenarios from two perspectives: user and provider. All three groups, however,
         soon reached the conclusion that the discussions, particularly of scenario 2, must take into account the perspectives of three
         entities: publishers,
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-13-</i></p>
         
         libraries as intermediaries or institutional users, and individual end users. To be successful, an access management system
         must be acceptable to both the end users and the intermediary library. The difficulty is, these parties differ greatly in
         their goals, economic motivations, legal responsibilities (particularly regarding liability), and in the different values
         or utilities they attribute to particular publications or works.
      </p>
      
      <p>Licenses typically represent agreements made between libraries (or parent academic institutions or consortia) and publishers
         (or publishers' agents). Access management systems that operationalize those agreements, however, will limit what operations
         an end user can perform on a digital work. Systems must permit an end user to negotiate different terms and conditions for
         use of a work by establishing a different role through a separate or additional agreement. For example, enhanced terms might
         be based on an individual society membership or subscription, or on the acceptance of a charge. Some lawyers pointed out that
         for the end user to be able to exercise some of the privileges afforded by law or take advantage of ambiguities, he or she
         should be able to make an informed decision to ignore clauses in an agreement made between a library and a publisher. Agreements,
         suggested one participant, should incorporate formal loopholes permitting a wider range of operations from a special location
         or through an additional level of authorization.
      </p>
      
      <p>The fact that all three discussion groups found it necessary to make a distinction between the end user and the institutional
         user acting as intermediary suggests that access management systems should be designed with such a distinction in mind. One
         group report included the observation that there will sometimes be a chain of obligation through several intermediaries from
         users through libraries to publishers (possibly through third-party aggregators) and eventually to authors.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4><i>Will there be slow evolution or a revolution?</i></h4>
      
      <p>For libraries, publishers, and the communities they serve, networked access to scholarly information is not a completely new
         business, but an extension of an existing portfolio of services in an existing economic structure, with staff and customers
         familiar with old practices. Although there are hopes for long-term efficiencies in replacing paper-based information products
         with electronic equivalents, and the transformation of the process of scholarly communication has begun, libraries and publishers
         must deal with both for many years to come. The continuing availability of well-managed, high-quality bodies of scholarly
         information will depend on professionals who must be rewarded for their efforts. The economic balance among authors, publishers,
         aggregators and other service providers, libraries, and users may adjust over time, but unless the adjustment is gradual,
         existing products and services are likely to suffer.
      </p>
      
      <p>Although participants were not asked to consider the interests of authors, it was clearly assumed that access management systems
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-14-</i></p>
         
         must be acceptable to authors who wish to disseminate their work to the scholarly and scientific communities. Simple business
         models reflected in effective access management systems would go a long way towards satisfying the needs of authors as well
         as other interested parties.
      </p>
      
      <p>Academic users expect predictability and continuity. They expect the electronic environment to offer the functional equivalent
         of privileges that exist under current copyright law as applied to physical works, including but not limited to fair use.
         Conditions on the use of electronic versions of articles that create new impediments to research, to teaching practice, or
         to collaboration across disciplines or between faculty and students are cause for substantial complaint. The academic user
         expects to have access to information and be able to use it for scholarly purposes at a reasonable price, preferably, but
         not necessarily, zero. Charges for photocopying and photographic reproductions are common in academic libraries, which may
         also charge for or limit use of other services. However, users expect free access to the information traditionally found on
         the library shelves, such as journals to which the library subscribes.
      </p>
      
      <p>Publishers and learned societies must find ways to reallocate resources and adjust their business model without destroying
         their short-term financial viability. When negotiating licenses for electronic versions of print publications, they clearly
         need to maintain revenue (or increase it to cover the new costs associated with the networked dissemination). Learned societies,
         in particular, are likely to have no cash reserves to invest in the hope of future cost savings; preserving cash flow is a
         matter of survival.
      </p>
      
      <p>Libraries, too, are facing serious budget constraints. Many must make do with flat or shrinking budgets not only to maintain
         existing collections and services while struggling to keep up with prices for serials that are outstripping the rate of inflation,
         but also to meet the demand for new online services. They hesitate to accept pricing models that do not guarantee control
         over acquisition budgets.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4><i>Will economics govern acceptance?</i></h4>
      
      <p>The acceptance by libraries and end users of electronic publications and associated access management systems will be determined,
         at least in part, by economic factors. Libraries regularly look for cheaper ways to provide the same services or ways to provide
         enhanced services at costs they can justify or recover. Users will pay for services and academic administrations will increase
         budgets only if they expect to receive value for the expenditure.
      </p>
      
      <p>Transaction costs associated with managing and providing access to scholarly information must be reasonable, whether incurred
         by users, libraries, or publishers. Arrangements between libraries for free interlibrary loan are common, in part to avoid
         costly accounting or payment procedures. Recent years have seen a growth in library consortia and third-party services that
         allow institutions to share the fixed costs associated with negotiating licenses and supporting coherent
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-15-</i></p>
         
         access to a variety of online resources. It is unlikely that information providers, whether publishers (as in scenario 2)
         or libraries (as in scenario 1) benefit by limiting access to a resource to subsets of users from an academic institution.
         The transaction costs of ensuring compliance with such limits will almost certainly exceed any loss of revenue sustained in
         granting more general access.
      </p>
      
      <p>The pricing of institutional licenses for electronic resources remains a complex issue that requires further research, perhaps
         along the lines of the University of Michigan's PEAK project. Existing models are not wholly satisfactory. Pay-per-view is
         not acceptable as the standard pricing scheme for libraries acting as intermediaries. Similarly, it may make sense to base
         prices on a maximum number of simultaneous users when information is accessed via terminal sessions, but not when it is accessed
         via stateless Web interactions. For large and heterogeneous user populations (such as the entire population of a state), pricing
         by size of community makes no sense either. Alternative measures of volume are needed as a basis for subscription prices.
         But what metrics are appropriate and acceptable? Some participants suggested that fruitful analogies might be drawn from pricing
         schemes for network connections.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4><i>Simplicity pays</i></h4>
      
      <p>Perhaps the strongest message that emerged from this workshop was that whatever the system for managing access, it must be
         simple. It must be comprehensible and convenient for intermediaries and end users. The emphasis should be on finding ways
         to reasonably limit abuses and punish abusers rather than complicating life for every user. The system need not be designed
         to handle every special case but should be able to inform users of nonstandard provisions (such as the complex terms of a
         gift) without attempting to enforce them. Prototype systems should be developed to handle the majority of routine needs effectively.
         Publishers appear willing to tolerate a little leakage, if it does not turn into wholesale hemorrhage.
      </p>
      
      <p>Complexity should be hidden from users, but those who want to know the full details of a complex deed of gift or the reason
         why access to an item is restricted should be able to find that information. Participants agreed that it is incumbent upon
         intermediaries (libraries and third-party aggregators) to negotiate simple licenses, with a view to making the management
         system simple to implement and to explain to users. Several argued that simple licenses benefit providers too, since they
         are less costly to negotiate and acceptable to a wider range of customers than are more complex licenses.
      </p>
      
      <p>Systems that are straightforward to implement and easy to use will encourage compliance. Participants argued that is not absolutely
         necessary for systems designed to manage access to scholarly resources also to handle materials to which access must be limited
         for reasons of security. In the short term, the aim should be to build a system that operationalizes a few different, simple
         agreements. The design should be modular, flexible, and have the capacity for
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-16-</i></p>
         
         growth. Extensions can be made later, on the basis of practical experience.

         <h2>Convenors' Questions</h2>
      </center>
      <a name="convenorsdistinctions"></a><hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>What kinds of role distinctions are necessary?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Users of the resources in these scenarios may play many different roles, using the term <i>role</i> in a general sense. A faculty member may, for example, act as teacher, author or creator, researcher, consultant, or private
         individual. It would be impossible, participants argued, for an individual to declare that access to a particular article
         was being sought in conjunction with only one such role. Some expressed a fear that the mere technical ability to introduce
         and enforce distinctions among roles would lead to the adoption of practices that would discourage the general pursuit of
         knowledge and so would not be in the best of academic interests. One librarian recalled a case in which access to a licensed
         resource was permitted to faculty only during semesters in which they were teaching particular courses, regardless of whether
         the resource was useful to research or even to the preparation of the courses.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the context of automated authorization and access management schemes, the term <i>role</i> has a related but more specific sense. It describes recorded characteristics of an individual user, such as membership in
         a group. Rules within the access management system determine whether a user with a particular role is able to access a resource
         and what operations he or she can perform on it. A user's role or roles might be established or negotiated in different ways,
         for example, through a campus-based proxy service or authorization scheme supported by a directory database, by membership
         in a professional society, or by acceptance of a charge to a credit card. Where institutional licensing of published journals
         is being considered, roles may be divided into those for which the institution can issue credentials and those that must be
         negotiated by the individual. Participants agreed that any access management scheme should allow an individual user to negotiate
         privileges beyond those afforded by institutional credentials or offered to the general public.
      </p>
      
      <p>Much of the discussion in this area focused on the granularity (degree) of role distinctions required and perhaps transmitted
         through credentials or gateway services that an institution may provide for members of its community. Privacy, cost of implementation,
         and institutional requirements (associated with varying missions and policies) were seen as factors here. Some argued strongly
         that the granularity should be no finer than membership in a community as defined by the licensing institution, in other words,
         that all those affiliated with a university should have access to the same resources on the same terms. Finer distinctions
         by school or department within a university (such as those suggested in the second scenario) are likely
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-17-</i></p>
         
         to inhibit cross-disciplinary research. Distinctions between faculty, undergraduates, and graduate students would cause problems
         for teaching. Others suggested that some distinctions might be necessary because of institutional policies relating to services
         for alumni, say, or, in the case of state universities, services for the general public. The consensus was that fine role
         distinctions should be avoided and that certification of any distinctions should be the responsibility of the user institution.
      </p>
      
      <p>The technology, said participants, should allow libraries and publishers to make the business agreements they want, but both
         sides are more likely to benefit if the agreements do not rely on complex role distinctions. In the second scenario, licensed
         journals are only of interest to a subset of the community; in such a case, the licensor and licensee might avoid the transaction
         costs in enforcing special limitations on access by negotiating the subscription price on a different basis. One suggestion
         was to base the price on the size of the subset interested in the resource (though not limiting access to this group). Others
         stressed the value of developing a volume-based approach to pricing other than a pay-per-view model.
      </p>
      
      <p>The purpose of use, observed two breakout groups, is often more relevant than any characteristic of the user. In the first
         scenario (public domain materials digitized by libraries), libraries would probably encourage any use for teaching or research
         but wish to control commercial re-use of digital reproductions made at substantial expense, in order to recover costs or fund
         future digitization projects. The privileges afforded by the fair use doctrine and exceptions granted in copyright laws are
         also primarily based on the nature (and effects) of use and not on characteristics of the users. On further reflection, participants
         concluded that requiring users to declare in advance how they intended to use materials was unrealistic and would be seen
         as an invasion of privacy.
      </p>

      <center>
         <h3><i>What rights and duties are expected?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>One issue raised by this question related to the use of the term <i>rights</i>. Under U.S. copyright law, observed Mary Levering of the U.S. Copyright Office, publishers and authors have <i>rights</i> in intellectual works but that users exercise <i>privileges</i> and duties. Furthermore, copyright owners and their agents generally manage rights in copyrighted works, whereas libraries
         generally manage access to those works.
      </p>
      
      <p>As pointed out earlier (under the heading What perspectives are needed?), users and providers have different expectations.
         Rights, privileges, duties, and responsibilities are shaped not only by license agreements, but also by the overall legal,
         economic, and technical environment. They will be subject to change over time.
      </p>
      
      <p>Legally, privileges and duties may be established through a chain of obligation from author or creator to publisher, to library
         (possibly via a consortium or third party aggregator) to end user. Not every link in this chain is associated with a formal
         agreement. In the first scenario, where unpublished materials may be involved,
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-18-</i></p>
         
         there may be no way to follow the chain and establish unambiguously the rights associated with the original materials. Complex
         terms of gift may impose additional duties on the recipient library. After converting the material to digital form and becoming
         the provider of online access, the library may wish to assert rights in the digital reproductions in order to safeguard the
         potential for income or retain control over how the materials are used. Most users of converted archival materials would comply
         with reasonable terms, if it were easy to determine what the terms were. Automatic enforcement of all such terms is infeasible,
         since they often apply to subsequent use rather than to access or to specific operations that might be controlled by technical
         means. Both providers and users would benefit in this case from a mechanism that cautions users about special conditions and
         allows them to determine whether or how to proceed.
      </p>
      
      <p>Academic users value their personal space highly. In the words of one librarian, users want the library to "make the connection
         and get out of the way." They expect to be allowed to exercise personal responsibility or, as one breakout group reported,
         to have the "right to do reasonable things and the responsibility not to do unreasonable things." They would expect any access
         management system to allow them access to all the information that they are entitled to have access to, inform them of their
         privileges and responsibilities, and explain how they can negotiate additional privileges. They expect patterns of use permitted
         for print publications to carry over into the electronic environment. They also expect that publishers will somehow guarantee
         that the content they are accessing has not been corrupted inadvertently or maliciously.
      </p>
      
      <p>For their part, publishers hope to maintain revenue, whether to satisfy shareholders, subsidize other activities, or simply
         cover costs. To achieve this end, they expect to control distribution of works for which they hold rights. They expect that
         privileges given to users based on a reasonable business model can be implemented by technical means. To be acceptable to
         publishers, an access management scheme must be customizable to individual license agreements and flexible enough to incorporate
         new types of agreement and new technology for authentication and for delivery of content. Market forces will determine which
         technical barriers to access and usage protect revenue and which inhibit market expansion.
      </p>
      
      <p>As intermediaries, libraries have the responsibility to negotiate reasonable agreements on behalf of their user communities
         and parent institutions. They cannot be responsible for the actions of end users, but they do have a duty to take reasonable
         efforts to inform users of terms and conditions for access and use and to ensure that institutional policies, as well as systems
         or data that support access controls are effective and valid. They will expect to understand how license agreements are encoded
         and enforced within an access management scheme, in order to fulfil these responsibilities. Libraries (or their parent institution
         or agent) must make reasonable assurances that proxy or gateway services exclude unauthorized users and that credentials offered
         for users are valid. In return, they will expect
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-19-</i></p>
         
         publishers' access management schemes to honor the credentials provided and facilitate access through such proxies.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the print environment, libraries have assumed the responsibility for archiving materials for posterity. Under section 108
         of the U.S. Copyright Law, libraries and archives may reproduce materials in certain circumstances, for example, to replace
         "a copy or phonorecord that is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, if the library or archives has, after a reasonable
         effort, determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price."<a href="#n8"> [8]</a> In an electronic environment in which the publisher controls the master copy, after-the-fact preservation will be impossible.
         Archiving for preservation must be planned for in advance. Libraries, as custodial institutions, will expect license agreements,
         and access management schemes that implement them, to provide contingency provisions and fail-safe mechanisms that ensure
         the long-term accessibility of the information resource. The long-term archiving of information in digital form presents a
         formidable challenge. Information, concluded one breakout group, "will only be preserved if someone's job depends on preserving
         it." Although the archiving challenge was beyond the scope of the workshop, participants noted that a possible contribution
         to an eventual solution would be special access management provisions that allowed libraries or trusted agents to make archival
         copies.

      <center>
         <h3><i>What are the privacy issues?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Participants were unanimous in their view toward the privacy of individual users, an important issue in the discussions surrounding
         the development of the CNI White Paper: the metadata that establishes privileges, they argued, should be under the control
         of the licensing organization and closely guarded. Using the CNI's categories of identification (anonymous, pseudonymous,
         pseudonymous with demographics, and actual identities), they recommended that campus-based authentication services, gateways,
         or proxies should not relay actual identities to access management schemes run by publishers or aggregators. Anonymous access,
         they concluded, poses the least threat to privacy. Pseudonymous identifiers ensure accountability by allowing a publisher
         to identify abnormal volumes of use by one (unidentified) user and notify the licensing organization. The association of demographic
         information with pseudonymous identifiers should be limited; under no circumstances should it be detailed enough to identify
         an individual user. As librarians have found, some publishers request more details than they can usefully analyze. However,
         libraries require some tracking of demographics for acquisition decisions and resource allocation, while providers may need
         such information to adjust business models.
      </p>
      
      <p>Participants stressed that no unnecessary information should be tracked by provider or licensing institution. Users should
         not be required
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-20-</i></p>
         
         to indicate the purpose of use. In many states, library reader records are confidential, and the law prohibits libraries from
         tracking readers' behavior. The academic community, some participants argued, should lobby for more extensive legal protection
         for privacy, extending to transactions with publishers and bookstores. However, it is reasonable to allow users to reveal
         personal information voluntarily in order to secure additional privileges, if they are told how that information will be protected.
      </p>
      
      
      <a name="convenorssecurity"></a><hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>How strong must the security controls be?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The design of any access management scheme will balance the tightness of security against user inconvenience and even denial
         of access to valid users in some cases. The degree of security enforced should be commensurate with the provider's trust in
         the user community. Publishers, it was also pointed out, do recognize that libraries are basically honest and will try to
         comply with reasonable license agreements to the best of their ability. Existing arrangements suggest that they would honor
         credentials generated through campus-based authentication schemes. Where trust between libraries is concerned, as in the first
         scenario, libraries have already proved the benefits of mutual trust in many resource-sharing activities, such as interlibrary
         loan. Libraries will certainly trust each other's authorization procedures if technically compatible.
      </p>
      
      <p>In neither of the scenarios examined by the workshop does the content call for very tight security. The limited market value
         of scholarly and archival information is unlikely to invite widespread abuse. Thus, in the case of a student dropout, say,
         it would not be essential for the system to be able to revoke privileges immediately. Other classes of information, however,
         such as current recreational literature or some reference materials, might require more robust controls because of the potential
         for publishers to lose revenue.
      </p>
      
      <p>Legal experts reminded participants that no access management scheme exists in a vacuum and that the external environment
         must be taken into account. They recommended that access management systems emphasize the detection of inappropriate behavior
         rather than enforcement ahead of time, which is likely to prevent some valid use. Users, they added, need to know what their
         responsibilities are, and institutional policies need to include adequate sanctions for abusers and procedures for dealing
         with them. Abuse could be punished by revoking privileges within the system or within the external environment.
      </p>
      
      <p>In considering how to balance accountability and privacy in the campus environment, participants found one technical approach
         that had emerged in the discussions relating to the CNI White Paper as promising. Campuses could issue short-term pseudonymous
         certificates to authenticated users. Certificates valid for a semester or a year could act as credentials for access to most
         information resources. For selected resources, certificates valid for a few hours might be more appropriate.

         <h3><i>What kinds of accountability are necessary and what kinds of management data are needed?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Participants reiterated that libraries cannot, in practice, be accountable for the actions of users. Realistically, they can
         only make reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with license terms and the law. Any license agreement between a publisher
         or publisher's agent and a library will include some clauses relating to accountability of either party for complying with
         terms of the agreement. The JSTOR Library License Agreement, repeatedly cited as a model, stipulates that libraries must inform
         JSTOR if they are using a proxy server to control access, must exert reasonable efforts and cooperate with JSTOR in the implementation
         of security procedures, must work with JSTOR to inform users of the User Rules, and must notify JSTOR if the library becomes
         aware of violations. The license allows either JSTOR or the licensee organization to terminate access in the case of unauthorized
         use. To the extent that access to licensed resources is supported by technical means, some degree of accountability for the
         effectiveness of those technical controls is to be expected. As mentioned in the discussion on security controls, the group
         favored after-the-fact accountability rather than automated enforcement that might prevent valid access.
      </p>
      
      <p>In conjunction with the discussion on privacy, participants observed that libraries, even when objecting to licenses that
         limit access to subsets of users, may still wish to collect usage statistics aggregated by demographic categories in order
         to make acquisition decisions and allocate resources. As noted earlier, some publishers ask for access to more demographic
         details than they fully use. No specific suggestions emerged as to an appropriate level of detail. In this instance, it is
         possible that both publishers and libraries would like to gather more detail for management purposes than is consistent with
         protection of the user's privacy.

         <h3><i>How do we evaluate effectiveness of the system from user and provider perspectives?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>According to participants, the basic test for a general access management scheme will be whether it is adopted in the marketplace.
         Its success will depend at least in part on quantity and breadth of use and its viability on whether the various parties receive
         appropriate value in the bargains they strike. Not surprisingly, no short-term or formal measures of effectiveness were discussed,
         since there is still much uncertainty about how best to evaluate digital libraries. No better criteria have emerged than precision
         and recall, which have served heretofore to evaluate information retrieval systems of much more limited scope.

         <h3><i>Where do authors fit in?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>As pointed out in the final plenary discussion session, the instructions for the breakout discussions omitted an important
         topic: the rights and perspectives of authors. In the end, it was decided that the relationship between authors, publishers,
         and users was too complex to bring into the discussion, and that a separate session would be needed to represent the perspective
         of authors. During the discussion, several points were made. Some participants argued that authors are both the ultimate information
         providers and, at least for scholarly journals, also the ultimate users. Faculty researchers must be educated to think twice
         about assigning all rights for articles to publishers, given the costs university libraries must bear in buying back the right
         to access the content and other barriers to broad access that publishers might wish to impose.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other participants pointed out that the apparent equivalence between users and authors mentioned above is simplistic and demonstrates
         an American viewpoint rather than a global perspective. Legally, the rights of authors are very different from the privileges
         of users. In many other countries, authors retain moral rights even when they assign copyright to publishers; in some countries,
         they may not waive those rights. In Europe, authors have made their voices heard in objections to attempted agreements between
         libraries and publishers. Groups representing authors are working to use the technology to enforce their own rights, for instance
         by supporting the development of digital watermarking technology. In the United Kingdom, the Authors' Licensing and Collecting
         Society (ALCS) is adamantly opposed to the U.S. concept of fair use.

         <h3><i>What about unaffiliated individuals and small institutions?</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Scenario 1 highlights the fact that most academic libraries consider their services to unaffiliated individuals -- the general
         public -- an important component of their mission. For the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, the provision
         of unfettered access to digitized collections is essential. Likewise, many state university libraries are required by law
         to provide service to unaffiliated users.
      </p>
      
      <p>Increasingly, consortial and outreach activities undertaken by universities require academic libraries to provide services
         to smaller, less well-endowed institutions, such as K-12 schools, that do not have the technical infrastructure to provide
         authentication services. Institutions may wish to provide access to resources for which the library may not legally provide
         general access, but for which rights holders have granted permission for educational use. To facilitate access to such materials
         from schools and public libraries, the Library of Congress has considered establishing a site-license arrangement (at little
         or no charge). It lacks the technology and resources,
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-23-</i></p>
         
         however, to implement such a scheme nationwide, because these institutions lack the necessary technical infrastructure. Even
         the simple application of IP source filtering is not feasible, since many small organizations do not have permanent IP addresses,
         but obtain them dynamically from Internet Service Providers each time they establish a connection. Clearly, state or local
         government agencies, consortia, or other third-party organizations must ensure that basic, uniform authentication and authorization
         services are available for small institutions and unaffiliated users.
      </p>
      
      
      <a name="unanticipatedchange"></a><hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>Accommodating change</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>As pointed out earlier, the external legal, economic, and social framework in which access management schemes operate will
         change over time. Systems must be able to adapt to such changes if they are to succeed. The need for such flexibility may
         determine how best to represent rights or responsibilities within metadata associated with digital material and as rules implemented
         within access management systems. System designers should take nothing for granted: even status transitions that appear to
         be predictable -- as in the case of expiration dates for copyrights held by corporate bodies or by creators who have died
         -- are not certain, as current legislative recommendations to extend the period of copyright demonstrate (<a href="#appendixc">see appendix C</a>). Furthermore, they must be prepared for changes of global dimensions: when photocopiers were introduced, copyright laws
         around the world were modified. Similarly, electronic publishing and network technology will disrupt the delicate balance
         between enabling creativity and inhibiting theft of intellectual property. As this effect is better understood, more changes
         to copyright laws are inevitable.
      </p>
      
      <p>Two other notable trends in the external environment in recent years are creating further challenges for the design and deployment
         of access management systems. The growing phenomenon of distance learning in many universities leads to pressure for remote
         access to more library services in order to serve the expanded student body. Libraries are also establishing consortia to
         share the costs of licensing or of mounting electronic resources. For multicampus institutions, new centralized organizations
         may be formed to serve this role. For libraries without campus-based authentication systems, the consortia may provide authentication
         and proxy services. Access management schemes must be adaptable to a variety of third-party intermediate arrangements and
         changes in license agreements.
      </p>
      
      <p>Widespread adoption of technology will undoubtedly stimulate further change. Access management systems must adapt to rights
         regimes around the world as global access to information becomes feasible from more countries. The scope of publications considered
         during tenure review is also likely to change. One participant urged the community represented in the room to persuade university
         presidents that the tenure process is possible without paying exorbitant sums to publishers. Whether or not they are persuaded,
         the growing
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-24-</i></p>
         
         importance of the "grey" literature (such as electronic preprints) in some disciplines will undoubtedly affect the perspective
         of both users and scholarly publishers.
      </p>
      
      
      <a name="unanticipatedambiguity"></a><hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>Accommodating ambiguity</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The 1996 workshop on Technology of Terms and Conditions revealed the ambiguities and uncertainties inherent in copyright and
         related law. Systems developers were surprised to learn that laws often allow for flexible interpretations (in other words,
         are intentionally ambiguous), with the expectation that different interpretations will be tested in the courts and evaluated
         in the light of practical experience and other laws. Workshop participants devoted considerable attention to the ambiguities
         that might affect the design of access management systems, most of which have already been noted in this report but merit
         repeating.
      </p>
      
      <p>License agreements can clarify some ambiguities, but not others. The rights pertaining to the historical materials Digital
         Library Federation members may propose to digitize for the Making of America project, for instance, may be impossible to ascertain.
         The moral rights of authors (in countries that recognize such rights) are not usually reflected in license agreements between
         libraries and publishers. Economic constraints may prevent publishers from establishing unambiguously the rights associated
         with illustrations and other subcomponents in old publications that are now being made available in electronic form. Like
         the participants in the Making of America project, they must find a way to assess and manage the risk. The original creators
         may or may not be interested in asserting any rights, depending on the age and nature of the works, the purpose of the use,
         and the current commercial viability of the works.
      </p>
      
      <p>Another ambiguity relates to exceptions and limitations to intellectual property rights afforded by laws. Exceptions are usually
         based on the purpose of use and its effects on any market for the protected work. At the point at which access is controlled,
         users may not even know how they propose to use the work (beyond ascertaining whether it is of interest at all). In the view
         of workshop participants, it would be unreasonable and an invasion of privacy to require users to declare why they were accessing
         a work. A case in point might be researchers who are unwilling to explain their interest in a particular research topic when
         preparing a grant proposal or in existing patents in an area in which they have developed patentable technology. Users searching
         MEDLINE to research a serious medical condition may not wish to disclose that they or a family member have health problems.
         There is no way to enforce the fair use provisions of U.S. copyright law on the basis of characteristics of users. Each case
         is judged on its merits.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>The workshop on access management held in Washington, D. C., on April 6, 1998, yielded several conclusions worth highlighting.
         It identified the need for research and evaluation of prototype projects in two key areas: <i>system usability and economic models</i>. The design of access management systems should be based on a better understanding of how users interact with such systems,
         what new information types will meet user needs, and what function these types perform in the emerging digital environment.
         To establish a viable economic balance for publishers, libraries and other intermediaries and users in the academic community,
         new standards of measure must be found to assess the usage of digital resources and thereby to develop alternative pricing
         schemes and payment mechanisms.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition, workshop participants identified five key properties for access management systems that would make them acceptable
         to users and libraries while respecting the rights and interests of authors and publishers.<a href="#n9"> [9]</a>
         
         <ul>
            
            <li><i>Simplicity</i>. The less complex a system of access management, the more readily it can be adopted technologically and organizationally,
               and the more acceptable it is to all involved in its implementation.
            </li>
            
            <li><i>Privacy</i>. Systems that manage access to the cultural record must protect the privacy of users from detailed tracking and disclosure
               of use. User privacy must not be compromised.
            </li>
            
            <li><i>Good faith</i>. Agreements on access to scholarly information rely on trust among the parties involved. Users and providers would each prefer
               to depend, in an access management system that implements these agreements, on reasonable barriers against abuse rather than
               complex restrictions that inhibit use.
            </li>
            
            <li><i>Trusted intermediaries</i>. Intermediaries play an essential role in providing access to the cultural record as parties trusted by both users and providers
               and as efficient aggregators of distribution and usage. System design must take the role of intermediaries into account.
            </li>
            
            <li><i>Reasonable terms</i>. Access management systems and license agreements must recognize the distinction between access and use. Overly tight control
               of access to a resource may impose inappropriate constraints on its use, especially in teaching and research contexts. The
               most useful system will not limit access to specific user groups known in advance to be interested in a resource but will
               be reasonably open to serving unlikely users whose curiosity and research interests may lead them in directions not predicted
               by those responsible for making the agreements or designing the systems.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>The findings of this workshop are relevant to a wide range of interested parties:
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-26-</i></p>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>policy makers involved in making decisions on managing digital data in relation to questions of privacy;</li>
            
            <li>legal experts who draft contracts and licenses which must be implemented through technical mechanisms for authentication and
               authorization;
            </li>
            
            <li>technologists designing new software for controlling electronic use and mis-use; and</li>
            
            <li>publishers and librarians, who, as major providers of information, play a central role in striking a balance between protecting
               copyright and providing access to the cultural record of knowledge.
            </li>
            
         </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Although the workshop focused primarily on the means of managing access to published knowledge in digital form in the context
         of the research library, it also made clear the much larger dimensions of access management issues. With the enormous growth
         in digital records of every form, the issues of privacy, protection, authorization, and authentication are fast becoming a
         concern for all citizens.

         <h2>Appendix C: Update on Related Legislative Activity</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>At the April 1996 workshop on access management, Peter Jaszi (Washington College of Law, American University) gave a summary
         of current legislative activity relating to intellectual property rights, drawing attention to some potential problems for
         libraries. March 1998 had seen considerable activity in Congress, under pressure from the commercial sector, particularly
         from the motion picture and sound industries. According to Jaszi, the leading legislative proposals made no significant distinctions
         for scholarly communication or academic use. His impression was that there was an inclination to pass bills within the forty
         legislative days then left in the current session of Congress.
      </p>
      
      <p>The proposals dealt with three issues, all of which had been under legislative consideration for more than two years: copyright
         term extension [HR 2589], database protection [HR2652], andWIPO implementation [HR 2281, Coble]. All three proposals had been
         reported out of the House Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property and the House Judiciary Committee for floor action.
         HR 2589 had been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Jaszi indicated that the Senate Judiciary Committee was considering
         passing the bills on for floor action without full consideration within the committee.
      </p>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>Term extension</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>HR 2589 would add 20 years of copyright protection for works currently under copyright protection. The extension would not
         apply to works for which copyright has already expired. The new copyright term would be the life of the author plus 70 years.
         The proposal included no concessions for academic use. According to Jaszi, the exemption for libraries and archives in relation
         to making copies of out-of-print works, for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research, during the last 20 years of
         protection was weak.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>Database protection</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>HR 2652 (the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act) proposed a new right for databases that are simply compilations but
         require significant investment. Based on principles of unfair competition rather than copyright, this bill was partly in response
         to the decision in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co. Inc, [499 U.S. 340, 18 USPQ2d 1275(1991), 41 PTJC 443,
         453]. Feist denied copyright protection to compilations, unless there is value added through selection, coordination, or arrangement.
         As written, this new protection for databases would apply to any information that can be organized systematically, including
         facts, numerical data, and works of authorship. Penalties would apply to those who damaged the actual or potential market
         for a protected database by extracting data. These penalties would apply to end users as well as to commercial re-users, although
         an amendment provides partial protection for nonprofit organizations. The period of protection is 15 years.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>-33-</i></p>
      
      
      <p>In response to a question, Jaszi confirmed that there is no associated requirement for deposit (as there is, under mandatory
         deposit regulations, for most published works protected by copyright). Jaszi reported that the exemptions for scientific and
         academic use have been described as ineffective.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>WIPO implementation</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>HR 2281 would provide reasonable prohibitions and penalties relating to tampering with copyright management information. In
         addition, it included prohibitions against circumvention of copyright protection schemes, whatever the motivation. Jaszi regarded
         it as significant that the bill did not reaffirm the principle of fair use, offered no exemptions for digital preservation
         by libraries or distance education, and provided no preemption of contract terms by constitutional privileges or federal law.
         Jaszi noted that a pair of companion bills suggested an alternative approach to conformance with the World Intellectual Property
         Organization treaty that addressed many of these concerns. These are Senator John Aschroft's (R-MO) Digital Copyright Clarification
         and Technology Act (S 1146) in the Senate and the Digital Era Copyright Enhancement Act (HR 3048), introduced by Reps. Rick
         Boucher (D-VA) and Tom Campbell (R-CA) in the House.
      </p>
      
      <p>Jaszi noted that the committee actions on HR 2652 and HR 2281 were very recent. For updates, he recommended consulting the
         Web site of the Digital Future Coalition, which represents many library organizations, at <a href="http://www.dfc.org/">http://www.dfc.org/</a>.

      <p>The following definitions have been compiled from those used by Waters and the other presenters at this workshop, by the DOI
         Rights Metadata Working Group, and by Clifford Lynch in the draft CNI White Paper.

      <p>Terms with an asterisk are used in figure 4, which was drawn up following the workshop as a result of discussions among Donald
         Waters, John Erickson, William Arms, and Caroline Arms. Figure 4 combines elements of diagrams presented by Waters and Erickson
         at this workshop (figures 2 and 3) and in William Arms's February 1998 article in <i>D-Lib Magazine</i>, "Implementing Policies for Access Management." The grey boxes represent components of an automated authorization system,
         whereas the white boxes represent the interactions between users and providers in the external environment or between either
         party and the access management system.

         <h3><i>Access Management</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Access management is a process mediated by information managers by which users gain authorized access to the intellectual
         property of creators/owners/providers. Access management systems make use of authentication and authorization services to
         enable or control access to and use of a networked resource.

      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>*Agreements</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In figure 4, the term <i>agreements</i> refers to licenses and other legal agreements, entered into by or on behalf of users with information providers. Agreements
         may be made in different ways, for example, through formal contract or acceptance of terms at time of access.
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>-35-</i></p>
         
         Within an automated access management system, the agreement and applicable laws will be implemented through a set of policy
         rules.
      </p>
      
      <p>The DOI Rights Metadata Working Group uses the term both for a legal agreement between the parties and the corresponding representation
         of rules that control access within a system. For that group, "an Agreement is a statement of permitted operations, and applicable
         terms, for a given object or set of objects, and a given user or set of users. The default Agreement is that for 'all users',
         probably permitting a limited set of operations at standard fees. A site license that is already in place would be a specific
         Agreement."

      <center>
         <h3><i>*Authentication of users</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Authentication is the process whereby a network user establishes a right to an identity or name (such as a user ID, or credit
         card number). A user can establish this right through
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>something he or she knows (user ID and password),</li>
            
            <li>something he or she has (ID card), or</li>
            
            <li>something he or she is (handprint or retina scan).</li>

         <h3><i>*Authenticity of content</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The authenticity of digital content requires mechanisms to assure users that content has not been corrupted. Since digital
         content is easily manipulated in ways that cannot be easily detected, users will expect publishers and third party custodians
         of information to provide assurances of authenticity.

         <h3><i>*Authorization</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Authorization is the process of determining whether an identity (given a set of role attributes associated with that identity)
         is permitted to perform some action, such as accessing a resource. The identity may represent a particular individual or be
         anonymous or pseudonymous. In the context of access management, authorization will rely on access policy rules, role attributes
         of the user, and terms and conditions attributes of a digital object to determine whether the desired action is permitted
         and how to disseminate the material.

         <h3><i>Credential</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the context of access management, a credential is something that a user can present to an authorization system operated
         by an information provider as evidence of legitimacy. One form of credential is a user ID together with password. Another
         is a digital certificate following the X.509 standard. Support for transmitting such certificates and using them to control
         access is being incorporated into the latest versions of Web browsers and Web servers. See the CNI White Paper for more discussion.

         <h3><i>*Object attributes</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>If access to certain digital material is to be managed, metadata attributes must be associated with each digital content object
         to indicate what terms and conditions apply to that object. An attribute would typically indicate a class of material to which
         an object belongs, with a common set of terms and conditions applying to all material in that class.

         <h3><i>Operation</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the context of access management, an operation is any act that can be done with an object, internal or external, to a given
         computer system. Examples: view, print, save; modify, redistribute. (This definition is from the DOI Rights Metadata Working
         Group.) The word action is sometimes used in roughly the same way.

         <h3><i>*Policy rules</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Within in an access management system, policy rules are encoded to determine whether a user is entitled to access the digital
         object being requested and whether the requested operation is permitted. Policy rules operationalize agreements, such as licenses,
         and applicable law.

         <h3><i>Proxy</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the context of access management, a proxy is a special computer that acts as a gateway to one or more resources. The licensee
         organization (or its agent) typically deploys a proxy. The proxy relies on authentication services to establish the legitimacy
         of a user and then routes all traffic between that user and the licensed resource. See the CNI White Paper for more discussion.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3><i>*Role</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the context of access management, role is specified by attributes associated with a user's identity. Examples of role attributes
         are: membership in a university community, fulltime student, or individual subscriber to a scholarly journal. Authorization
         mechanisms use role attributes to determine whether a user is permitted to perform certain actions or operations on a resource
         or content object.

         <h3><i>*Use</i></h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Use of a digital resource may extend beyond the operations performed online by a user when accessing a digital object. A faculty
         member who has printed a copy of an article may, for example, use it for personal reference or to make fifty copies for distribution
         to a class. Access management systems can limit access and have the potential to limit online operations; systems cannot fully
         control subsequent use.
