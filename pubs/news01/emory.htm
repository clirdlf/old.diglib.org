<h3>A. Collections </h3>
<dl>
<dd>Many units within Emory's libraries are engaged in designing and developing digital collections. Most collections are developed to support campus teaching and research initiatives or as larger preservation and access efforts for the scholarly community at large. 
<p>
<dd>The main units involved in development of digital initiatives within the Emory libraries are:
<ul>
<li>The Beck Center for Electronic Collections and Services - focusing primarily on texts in the humanities
<li>The Electronic Data Service - focusing primarily on the manipulation and analysis of numeric data sets in the social sciences
<li>Hugh MacMillan Law Library - serving as the official digitizing and service point Federal Court Finder, the electronic full text archive of decisions handed down by Federal Circuit Court s of Appeals
<li>Health Sciences Center Library - focuses on MedWeb, a widely acclaimed gateway to biomedical Internet sites
<li>Pitts Theology Library - serving as the digital archive for the SELA Full text journal project (now serving as the foundation for the expanded ATLAS full text e-journal collection being developed by the American Theological Library Association)
<li>Preservation and Conservation - focusing on both print and non-print materials, including audio and video, held in the Emory libraries
<li>Special Collections and Archives - focusing on print and non-print materials in its collections, notably in Irish and American literature</ul>
<p>
<dd>Among the digital collections currently in development are:
<p>
<dd><b>Electronic Data Sets</b><br>
The General Libraries Electronic Data Service is in the process of mounting popular data sets in a variety of subject areas.

<p>
<dd><b>Electronic Document Delivery </b><br>
Beginning in Fall 2000, EDD will provide digital copies of journal articles or tables of contents from materials in the Emory libraries off-site storage facility, the Materiel Center. Digital copies will be made available to users on a library web server in the Adobe PDF format. The hardware component consists of a Xerox Document Center utilizing Adobe Acrobat for converting files from various image formats to PDF. (See also under <b>Systems, ILLiad</b>.)
<p>
<dd><b>Electronic Reserves</b><br>
The General Libraries' Electronic Reserves Project seeks to expand the scope of the traditional reserve reading list to include both print and electronic formats, and provide a single, comprehensive list for all materials needed for a particular course. Electronic reserve materials can include class Web sites, Web-based conferences, electronic journal articles, or scanned images of course-related documents. These electronic materials can be accessed directly through WebCat, the web based version of the library catalog, EUCLID. Students search for their reserve list in the library catalog, and when an electronic version of the material is available, can click on a hyperlink within the reserve record to access that material. Electronic access to reserve
material offers greater convenience in that students can access this material at any hour using the Internet, regardless of Access Services/Reserve Desk hours or the availability of print materials held at the Reserve desk.<br>

<h3>C. Systems</h3>
<dl>
<dd><b>ILLiad </b><br>
The Emory libraries will be installing the OCLC/Atlas Systems' ILLiad interlibrary loan system this Fall. This new system will store and search all data concerning interlibrary loan requests and processing, allowing users to check on the status of their orders via the Web at any time. Copyright clearance also will be automatically generated. ILLiad encompasses virtually every action in the ILL process, producing a highly efficient and effective work environment enhancing customer service while significantly reducing costs and staff workloads. Future enhancements will include a document delivery module
<p>
<dd><b>LIBNET</b><br>
LIBNET represents a way of remotely accessing a set of core library electronic resources from anywhere on the Internet. It is a software application with minimal requirements for hardware and network/modem speed, which means that the software can run on many older, less powerful workstations.

<h2><a name="#sec3_emory">II. Specific Digital Library Challenges</a></h2>
<dl>

<dd><b>General Libraries Reorganization</b><br>
During the academic year 2000-2001 the General Libraries will implement a major reorganization of its services and operating structure. One important facet of this reorganization is an effort to mainstream digital initiatives, to move them from project-based (and typically externally funded) efforts to program-based services. Among the many changes being proposed is the integration of the Electronic Data Center into the User Services wing of the libraries, the integration of the Beck Center for Electronic Collections and Services into the Information Services wing of the libraries, and the closing of the Virtual Library Project initiative. 
<p>
<dd><b>Server Security</b><br>
In 2000-2001 the General Libraries will implement a server security system which will ensure not only routine backups of all servers (including those storing electronic text and data files), but also provide a first line of defense against unauthorized intrusions from outside the library network. In 1999-2000 the General Libraries servers were inadvertently hacked into on several occasions, negatively affecting many of our digital collections. We anticipate our new server security measures will greatly reduce this threat in the future.
<p>
<dd><b>Develop integrated access to our digital collections</b><br>
Programming currently is underway to support cross-database, cross-platform searching of various digital collections (see <b>Emory Research Archives </b>and <b>Poetry Portal</b>) If this initiative proves as successful as we hope, we expect to apply such interoperability across many subject areas, including both locally-developed and commercially-produced text databases.
<p>
<dd><B>Long term preservation of digital information</b><br>
Through various library initiatives, including the SAGE Project and the Emory libraries new responsibility for University Records Management, we will be exploring ways to ensure long term preservation of digital files created locally, including email, text, and data files.
