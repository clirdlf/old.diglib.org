<dd><b>Cooperative Digital Reference Service Project</b> <br>
The Cornell University Library (CUL) is participating in The Cooperative Digital Reference Service Project, an international effort led by the Library of Congress, which is intended to create a system of linked reference services.  CUL participated in the initial test, which involved participants exchanging scripted questions and answers.  The second test is about to begin, which will test the software that will be used to route questions among participating libraries. The public Web site for the project is <br>
<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/digiref/">http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/digiref/</a>.
<p>

<dd><b>Creation Station Project</b> <br>
The Creation Station project is a collaborative effort between the Cornell University Library and the Cornell Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Group.  In the first semester of the project, eleven high-end computers were available in four locations on campus, three libraries including Engineering Library, Mann Library and Uris Library, and the HCI Lab.  In addition to the workstations themselves, each facility also had digital cameras, digital video cameras, scanners, quickcams and software for creating multimedia presentations.  Students from three different classes used the facilities to create multimedia presentations for their classes. There were also a significant number of students from outside these classes who used the facilities.  For more information about the Creation Station project please visit <br>
<a href="http://create.hci.cornell.edu/">http://create.hci.cornell.edu/</a>.
<p>

<dd><b>Electronic Document Delivery (EDD)</b>  <br>
EDD provides digital copies of journal articles or table of contents from materials in the Cornell University Library's off-site storage facility, the Library Annex.  The digital copies are made available on a Library Web server for two weeks in the Adobe PDF format.  The hardware component of this service consists of a 333 MHz Pentium II PC with an Minolta IMAX 500 imaging card and a standard ethernet card, a Minolta PS 3000 publication scanner, a Minolta MS 3000 microform scanner, a medium-volume laser printer, and a Canon 9000 fax machine.  The PS 3000 is an inverted planetary (overhead) scanner that allows bound volumes to lay face up while scanning, thus providing greater convenience and speed for the operator and reducing physical stress on the volume.  Software includes the Epic 3000 and the Microdax 3000 programs, (designed for use with the PS 3000 and MS 3000, respectively), as well as Adobe Acrobat for converting files from the TIFF format to PDF.  Several custom scripts and shareware programs have been integrated to streamline the Annex staff's workflow.  Eudora e-mail software is used to receive web form requests. <br>

<p>

<dd><b>Electronic Reserves</b> <br>
The electronic reserve system, available in Cornell University Library's Uris Library, is a service that uses the latest in image scanning technology to provide electronic document delivery. The system allows students to find, view and print course materials that have been placed on reserve by instructors. Materials in the electronic reserve system include journal articles, exams, course syllabi, problem sets and other materials.  Material may be retrieved by searching by instructor name, course title and number, author, or title of the material.  For more information see <br>
<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuaccess/er/er.html">http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuaccess/er/er.html</a>.  
<dl><dd>With the implementation of the Voyager system at Cornell, plans are underway for a campus wide electronic reserve system, which will allow Cornell students to access course reserve materials via the Web. This expanded electronic reserve system is planned for a January 2001 release. </dl>
<p>

<dd><b>Journal Table of Contents</b> <br>
Members of the Cornell University community can sign up to receive by e-mail the tables of contents of one or more of the 285 journals housed in the periodical reading room in the Albert R. Mann Library, Cornell University.  The TOC's are sent as the new issues arrive. <br>

<dd><b>Music Listening Stations</b> <br>
The Music Library's reserve music listening will be available through networked, digital streaming technology beginning this August.  Initially, access will be provided through state-of-the-art computers, on a fast network, in a new listening lab located in the recently reconstructed Music Library in Lincoln Hall.  Reserve music listening required for course work will be made available to students through a familiar web interface, affording a level of control and features not possible using traditional analog media.  Future developments in the enforcement of copyright concerns may enable the Library's music listening reserves to be made available to authorized listeners in their dorms, apartments and offices.
<p>

<dd><b>MyLibrary</b> <br>
In January, the Cornell University Library introduced MyLibrary, an initiative to provide personalized library services to Cornell University students, faculty, and staff.  Currently it consists of MyLinks, a tool for collecting and organizing resources for private use by a patron.  These resources may or may not be "official" Cornell University Library resources.  Our patrons best understand this service as a "traveling set of bookmarks." The next module will be MyUpdates, a tool to help scholars stay informed of new resources provided by the library.  MyUpdates will periodically query the Library catalog to determine which resources are new.  If the new resources match the pre-identified needs of a patron, MyUpdates e-mails the results to the patron automatically.  <br>

<p>

<dd><b>Project Euclid</b> <br>
Project Euclid is Cornell's principle electronic publishing initiative whose mission is to advance scholarly communication in the field of theoretical and applied mathematics and statistics. The end result should be the creation of a vibrant online information community that is based on a healthy balance of commercial enterprises, scholarly societies, and small, independent publishers.  Project Euclid has two foci. The first focus is to lead a collaborative effort of scholarly societies to foster the creation and adoption of multi-function metadata standards for the discipline and to produce guidelines for the creation of authoring tools to make it easier for authors and editors to use the metadata standards. This initiative will lay the groundwork for an infrastructure that will best serve users by allowing federated searching of disparate sites and reference linking between articles and journals, and by advancing the cause of electronic archiving. The second focus of Project Euclid is to help independent publishers in making the transition to the online environment in a way that will help them stay competitive with the large commercial journals.  Euclid will comply with the Dienst-based Open Archive Initiative standard for electronic publishing.  This cooperative venture between the Cornell University Library and Duke University Press was recently funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; the international scope of this activity will be expanded through a cooperative effort with the University of Michigan and the University of Goettingen (Germany), with joint support from the National Science Foundation and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (pending).   <br>

<dd><b>Risk Assessment Project</b> <br>
The Council on Library and Information Resources sponsored a risk assessment study conducted by Cornell University Library in 1999 that focused on the file format risks inherent in migration as a preservation strategy for digital materials.  The full report of this study will be available from CLIR in late June 2000.  For further information see "Risk Management of Digital Information: A File Format Investigation" in the RLG DigiNews, v.4, no.3, June 15, 2000. <br>

<dd><b>The Essential Electronic Agricultural Library (TEEAL)</b> <br>
The result of an historic cooperation between the Rockefeller Foundation, Cornell University's Albert R. Mann Library, and leading scientific publishers. This electronic library contains the full text -- complete with all graphics and illustrations -- of 130 agricultural journals, stored on compact disk.  Designed to support agricultural research in regions where there is an urgent need for increased food production, TEEAL is being made available to 108 of the lowest income food deficit countries (as listed in the World Bank's 1996 World Development Report)

<h2><a name="#sec3_cornell">III. Specific Digital Library Challenges</a></h2>
<dl>
<dd><b>Address the challenge of managing and distributing access to digital sound and moving images in a comparable manner to our current support for text-based materials.</b><br>
Sound and moving image processing and network dissemination is the next major challenge for Cornell´s digital library.  A pilot implementation for music distribution and support for classroom instruction has just been installed.  The size of sound and video collections presents storage, processing, and distribution challenges.  The next step in the challenge will be to accompany digital audio with digital scores and performances, further enhancing the ability to create music digitally by Cornell faculty and students.
<p>

<dd><b>Develop functional interoperability for integrated access to our various digital collections.</b><br>
Currently the Cornell University Library is applying an SGML encoded solution using Open Text software and middleware developed at the University of Michigan.  The Library is, however, a co-development partner with Endeavor Information Systems, Inc. in the creation of a digital library architecture (ENCompass) to provide interoperability across collections as well as to integrate ¨gateway¨ functionality for licensed resources.
<p>

<dd><b>Develop our new partnership with Sun Microsystems.</b><br>
Cornell University Library was recently named Sun Center of Excellence for Digital Libraries (see under Grants above).  This partnership will allow the Library to explore the use of Sun Ray technologies, as well as newer technologies as they emerge.  In turn, CUL will provide Sun with information relevant to the development of these new technologies.  This synergistic relationship will provide new challenges, but will also enable great growth in the development of digital libraries.  
<p>

<dd><b>Developing an infrastructure for the electronic publishing of journals.</b><br>
This challenge is the central focus of the Project Euclid initiative.
<p>

<dd><b>Establishing common preservation metadata standards.</b><br>
This challenge is being addressed by the Preserving Cornell's Digital Image Collections project.
<p>

<dd><b>Expand electronic publishing at Cornell.</b><br>
A plan for a joint project between the Cornell University Library and Cornell University Press is being developed to broaden the use of electronic publishing for press publications and to potentially apply this same approach to other scholarly communication generated at Cornell.
<p>

<DD><b>Long term preservation and access of digital information.</b><br>
This challenge is being embraced in Project PRISM.

<dd><b>Moving Theory into Practice: Digital Imaging for Libraries and Archives</b><br>
With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Cornell University Library's Department of Preservation and Conservation developed a new digital imaging workshop.  "Moving Theory into Practice: Digital Imaging for Libraries and Archives" is intended for librarians, archivists, curators, administrators, technologists, and others who are contemplating or implementing digital imaging programs. The goal is to provide participants with the means to move beyond theoretical constructs to implementation strategies grounded in solutions that represent current/emerging standards, best practices, and sound decision-making.
