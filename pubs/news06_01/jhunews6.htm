<div class="collections">
<h2>A. Collections</h2>

<h3>Maryland Art and Artists</h3>
<p>Based at the Sheridan Libraries, Maryland ArtSource is a
scholarly Web resource on Maryland artists, cultural heritage
institutions, art collections online, art libraries and the
regional art community. It is the collaborative effort of eight
cultural and arts organizations in Baltimore dedicated to
promoting art information resources that illuminate Maryland art
and artists.<br />
<a href="http://www.marylandartsource.org/">http://www.marylandartsource.org</a></p>

<h3>American Sheet Music</h3>
<p>The Lester S. Levy Collection of Sheet Music contains 30,000
pieces of music and focuses on popular American music spanning
the period 1780 to 1960. Both the sheet music covers and the
scores have been digitized and the collection is searchable. It
is currently being migrated to an institutional repository
(DSpace). Research activities associated with the collection
include the development of a digital workflow management system,
and research on optical music recognition.<br />
<a href="http://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu/">http://levysheetmusic.mse.jhu.edu</a></p>

<h3>Digital Maryland Maps</h3>
<p>The Sheridan Libraries' entire collection of Maryland atlases
prior to 1914 has been digitized, creating a resource of over
1,000 plates that can be used with other digital cartographic
data and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software. The
collection includes historical maps of Baltimore City as well as
aerial photographs originally produced for the U. S. Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service to monitor the use of
agricultural land.</p>

<h3>Laurence Hall Fowler "Lost Baltimore"</h3>
<p>Original photographs and drawings of lost and hidden Baltimore
from the Sheridan Libraries' Special Collections comprise the
"Lost Baltimore" collection. The Web-based collection includes
approximately 300 images drawn primarily from photographs taken
between the two world wars by Baltimore architect Laurence Hall
Fowler. This photographic record documents a wave of demolition
that took place in Baltimore's historic Mt. Vernon area during
the inter-war period. The images are linked to metadata in a METS
template and will ultimately be linked to a larger Web site
devoted to Baltimore architecture.<br /></p>
</div>

<div class="services">
<h2>B. Services</h2>
<h3>Instructional Technology</h3>

<p>The Center for Educational Resources (CER) partners with faculty
to extend their instructional impact through the integration of
digital technologies and innovative teaching strategies. Located
in the library, the Center's mission aligns with the evolving
role of university libraries as they advance from print-based
repositories to electronic collaboratories that enable
application of digital collections and networked services to new
approaches in instructional and scholarly communication. The
CER's popular Technology Fellows Program awards mini-grants to
faculty and students projects that enhance teaching, facilitate
access to course materials, encourage active learning and promote
student/teacher collaboration.<br />
<a href="http://www.cer.jhu.edu/">http://www.cer.jhu.edu</a></p>

<h3>Usability Evaluation and Research</h3>
<p>Usability testing is increasingly common in the library
community. Digital libraries present issues and opportunities
that merit the investigation of usability testing methods with
the aim of identifying the most appropriate approaches. The
Sheridan Libraries are engaged in research on meaningful
quantitative measures, the location and diversity of digital
library users, partial interface control, realistic vs.
controlled test settings, and the balance of user feedback and
librarian expertise.<br />

<h3>Virtual Library Services for Alumni</h3>
<p>Hopkins KnowledgeNET is a Web-based service devoted
exclusively to Hopkins alumni. Launched in 2004, this joint
venture of the Sheridan Libraries and the Johns Hopkins Alumni
Association offers free access to hundreds of journals,
newspapers and e-books, and fee-based access to an expanded set
of resources, such as the Harvard Business Review, The Economist,
and many other resources. The service also provides toll-free
phone, e-mail and fax access to a dedicated KnowledgeNET
librarian.<br />

<div class="systems">
<h2>C. Systems</h2>

<h3>Electronic Resource Management Development Partnership</h3>
<p>The Sheridan Libraries and the University of Chicago teamed
with SirsiDynix on their development of a full-featured
Electronic Resource Management (ERM) module. Staff in both
academic libraries worked with SirsiDynix to identify functional
requirements for the module, which is designed to be a
comprehensive ERM solution. Plans call for the Horizon
Information Management System to provide an industry-standard
platform for e-resource management, and open applications
environment with exposed Web Services APIs to Horizon
functionality.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Access to Print Materials</h3>
<p>CAPM focuses on the evaluation and development of a robotic
system that will provide real-time access, through a Web
interface, to materials shelved in off-site locations. Also
collaborating on the project are faculty from the Departments of
Mechanical Engineering and Geography and Environmental
Engineering at Johns Hopkins and faculty from the Economics
Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder.</p>
<p>The first phase of the CAPM Project produced a prototype
retrieval robot and an economic analysis of the potential costs
and benefits. The economic analysis framework is applicable for
assessing general library services.<br />
<a href="http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/projects/capm">http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/projects/capm</a>
</p>

<h3>Structured Document Analysis Applications</h3>
<p>Gamera is a framework for the creation of structured document
analysis applications by domain experts. It combines a
programming library with GUI tools for the training and
interactive development of recognition systems. Gamera is a
Python-based framework, with many extensions in C++ for low-level
image processing. It runs on Linux, Microsoft Windows and
Macintosh OS X.<br />
<a href="http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/projects/gamera/">http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/projects/gamera/</a></p>

<h3>Services for Customizable Authority Linking</h3>
<p>With Tufts University digital library researchers, the
Sheridan Libraries will provide National Science Digital Library
users with automatic linking services that bind key words and
phrases to supplementary information and infrastructure to
support automatic linking of names and terms in thesauri,
glossaries, encyclopedias, subject hierarchies, and object
catalogs. The SCALE project is funded by the National Science
Foundation.<br />

<h2>A. Projects</h2>

<h3>New Project Announcements</h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Baltimore Architecture Project</h4>
<p>A collaborative effort led by the Sheridan Libraries, with the
Athenaeum of Philadelphia and Towson University, the project will
incorporate digital images, biographical information about
Baltimore's most prominent architects, and primary source
materials pertaining to Baltimore's rich architectural heritage.
The Sheridan Libraries will survey local institutions to identify
relevant historical resources. The Athenaeum of Philadelphia,
which developed a similar resource to document Philadelphia's
architectural resources, will assist in the design of the project
Web site and underlying database. Towson University will
spearhead the efforts to research local architects and
architectural firms, and will write the biographical sketches. A
$40,000 grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation is
funding the pilot phase of the project.</p>

<h4>Electronic Finding Aid for the Papers of Jacob Blaustein</h4>
<p>In 2004, the Sheridan Libraries received an extraordinary
collection of papers related to the personal and professional
life of Jacob Blaustein, who together with his father Louis,
founded the American Oil Company in 1910. The Libraries have
created a template for the EAD compliant finding aid that is
being developed to provide access to the rich research resources
in the collection. This project is supported by funding from the
Louis and Jacob Blaustein family foundations.<br /></p>

<h4>Unified Medical Language System-Based Archive System for Digital Resources</h4>
<p>The enormous amount of health-related material generated in
digital format-lab images, statistical data, databases, clinical
correspondence, internal reports, and pre-published papers-are of
great value to research and teaching, yet are challenging for
health science librarians to manage, archive, and preserve. A
variety of institutional repositories have recently emerged that
allow faculty to access, share, search, and retrieve their
digital material, but none of them offer built-in metadata
subject categorization, metadata indexing, and a comprehensive
search/retrieval interface geared towards time-crunched health
sciences professionals, and most of them require considerable
human involvement and have complicated or time-consuming
submission processes.</p>
<p>With funding from the National Library of Medicine, the
university's Welch Medical Library and the School of Medicine's
Microscope Facility will develop a Unified Medical Language
System-based Archive System (UAS) that will enable health science
professionals to create digital archives to manage their work and
help medical librarians to acquire, organize, and preserve their
institution's digital materials. The system will be based on
open-source code and technology and open standards and will be
integrated with an XML-based UMLS Web service as its metadata
source.</p>

<h4>Electronic Theses and Dissertations Pilot</h4>
<p>The Sheridan Libraries have launched a pilot project this year
to evaluate various electronic publishing systems including
DSpace, eprints, DPubS, and DiVA for electronic theses and
dissertations at Johns Hopkins. The pilot is a component of the
larger initiative led by the Libraries to create an institutional
repository.<br />
<a href="http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/activities/etdpilot">http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/activities/etdpilot</a></p>

<h4>Sakai</h4>
<p>The Sheridan Libraries, in collaboration with IT@JH, are
participants in the Sakai Educational Partners Program (SEPP), a
community of higher education institutions that are developing an
open-source, open-standards collaboration and learning
environment (CLE). Sakai will offer features and tools to support
electronic and distance learning, and collaboration for work
groups or teams. Given its flexible design and open nature, Sakai
provides the capability to integrate new services and features
within a course management environment, and preserve the digital
content that supports learning<br />
<a href="http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/activities">http://ldp.library.jhu.edu/activities</a></p>

<h4>A Technology Analysis of Repositories and Services</h4>
<p>The Sheridan Libraries, in collaboration with the University of
Virginia, MIT, and an extensive network of collaborators, are
conducting an architecture and technology evaluation of
repository software and services such as e-learning,
e-publishing, and digital preservation. The result will be a set
of best practices and recommendations that will inform the
development of repositories, services, and appropriate
interfaces. This project is funded by an award of $111,000 from
the Mellon Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Update on Existing Projects</h3>
<blockquote>

<h4>Digital Medieval Manuscripts- <i>Roman de la Rose</i></h4>
<p>An award of $717,000 this year from the Mellon Foundation is
funding the next phase of the Rose project to enhance medieval
studies through digital technology. The Mellon funding will
enable the project team to develop an integrated approach to
preservation and access through the design of a repository, which
will house the digital content and support its easy integration
into learning environments. In addition, the award will support
the creation of an advisory board, a technical conference, and
the digitization of additional versions of <i>Roman de la
Rose</i>, the story of a dreamer pursuing Love while encountering
obstacles, adventures and life lessons along the way.</p>
<p>Begun in 1998, this collaboration between the Johns Hopkins
University's Sheridan Libraries' Digital Knowledge Center and the
Department of Romance Languages enables new approaches to
medieval studies through the creation of digital surrogates,
transcriptions, and text and image searching. Rather than travel
thousands of miles to make comparisons of these texts, scholars
can easily compare and study them online.<br />
To date, Rose manuscripts from the Walters Art Museum in
Baltimore, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Los Angeles, and the Bodleian Library at Oxford
University have been digitized.</p>

<h4>Digital Audio Archive Project</h4>
<p>This project focuses on the design and creation of an
effective and economical workflow management system for
digitizing analog audio tapes, and building a Web-based digital
audio library. The primary goal is to reduce the costs associated
with building a digital audio library. Emphasis is placed on
using best practices, open standards and open-source software.
The Sheridan Libraries are working with Indiana University, which
is providing the tested through a subset of their audio tape
collection in the music archives. This project is funded by a
$230,000 grant from IMLS.<br /></p>
