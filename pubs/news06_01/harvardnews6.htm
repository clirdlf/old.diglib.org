    <h3>Investigating the Renaissance </h3>
    <p>An interactive demonstration by conservators and scientists in the Straus 
      Center for Conservation, located in the Fogg Art Museum showing the ways 
      in which computer technology can be harnessed to add to our knowledge about 
      Renaissance paintings and how they were made. Computer-assisted imaging 
      can reveal aspects of the process of making art not visible to the unaided 
      eye. It also reveals the alterations of intervening centuries, alterations 
      that were intended to repair the ravages of time and use, and to adjust 
      images to reflect changing aesthetic preferences. <br>

    <h3>Maya Archaeological Photographs from the Carnegie Institute of Washington 
      Collection</h3>
    <p>40,304 digital images of Maya archaeological photographs selected from 
      the Carnegie Institute of Washington Collection in the Photographic Archives 
      of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Many of the buildings, 
      monuments, and artifacts that are recorded in the photographs no longer 
      exist, are badly damaged or are so difficult to access that they are unavailable 
      to researchers. Discovery and delivery of the digital images has improved 
      access to the photographs for government researchers working on accurate 
      restoration and reconstruction of the sites, linguists needing undamaged 
      scripts, archaeologists, historians, publishers, and producers. View the

    <h3>Piet Mondrian: The Transatlantic Paintings</h3>
    <p>The term "transatlantic paintings" refers to a group of 17 works that Mondrian 
      started (and in some cases finished) in Europe between 1935 and 1940, and 
      finished (or refinished) in New York after his arrival there in the fall 
      of 1940. Many of Mondrian's works crossed the ocean during his lifetime, 
      but the seventeen transatlantic paintings are the only ones he worked on 
      in both Europe and America. <br>

    <p><b>Reserves List Tool </b></p>
    <p>As one of the first collaborative efforts between them, the Harvard University 
      Library, the Provost's Office and the Instructional Computing group for 
      the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have jointly developed a reserves list 
      tool for use by instructors, library staff and students. The Reserves List 
      Tool allows faculty members to submit reserves requests to the library via 
      a new module in the course "toolbox" available for the creation and maintenance 
      of course web sites. The information is transmitted to the library, where 
      reserves library staff fulfill the requests and update the citation descriptions. 
      Students can then view the list with availability information, including 
      direct digital links to e-resources such as journal articles, on their course 
      web site. </p>

    <P><b>E-Research @ Harvard Libraries</b><br>
      On June 30, 2005, the Harvard Libraries implemented MetaLib software from 
      Ex Libris to launch a set of new tools for access to e-resources and e-journals 
      and introduce federated searching and personalization features. <br>
      <a href="http://e-research.lib.harvard.edu">http://e-research.lib.harvard.edu</a></P>
    <P><b>OASIS Reimplementation</b></P>
    <p> In January 2005, OIS launched version 2.0 of OASIS (Online Archival Search 
      Information System), the online union catalog of finding aids for archival 
      collections at Harvard University. Searching more than 2,400 finding aids 
      from 18 Harvard archives and libraries with a single query, OASIS facilitates 
      the discovery of a wide range of primary research materials, including letters, 
      literary manuscripts, business records, musical scores, diaries, photographs, 
      drawings, printed material, and realia. Version 2 is the first major redesign 
      of the OASIS system since its debut in July 1998. Highlights of the new 
      release include a completely new user interface consistent with the look 
      and feel of other OIS applications (such as VIA and the Page Delivery Service); 
      an underlying XML database that supports indexed and wild card searching; 
      documents represented in the EAD ("Encoded Archival Description") standard 
      format; the ability to browse alphabetically and by repository; the ability 
      to download or print finding aids; the ability to refine searches by searching 
      within a results set, or combine searches to broaden the results; a "Search 
      History" that lets users see what search strategies they have tried throughout 
      a session and re-display the results; and the ability of curators to redact 
      portions of a finding aid to protect confidential information. OASIS finding 
      aids are also exposed to the wider community for searching by external search 
      engines such as Google and RLG.<br>

    <p><i>Delivery and Search Systems</i></p>
    <P><b>Reimplementation of Page Delivery Service (PDS) </b> <br>
      Page Delivery Service (PDS) was reimplemented during FY2005. The PDS provides 
      a navigational environment for digital surrogates of monographs, serials, 
      manuscripts, musical scores, and other page-oriented materials. The FTS 
      provides services for indexing and searching textual content in the PDS 
      as well as content delivered through other systems. As part of the PDS reimplementation, 
      the internal structure of page-turned digital objects was changed to use 
      METS (Metadata Encoding & Transmission Standard), an XML schema widely adopted 
      as a standard within the digital library community. Over 8,000 page-turned 
      objects pre-existing in the DRS were automatically converted to METS form. 
      The new PDS also features a newly designed user interface that provides 
      simplified page navigation, a graphic representation of the logical structure 
      of the entire page-turned object, and maximizes the screen area available 
      for the page images.<br>
      <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/pds/"> http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/pds/ 
      </a> </P>
    <P><b>Reimplementation of Full-text Search Service (FTS)</b></P>
    <P>Full-text Search Service (FTS) was reimplemented during FY2005. The reimplemented 
      system is based on Lucene, an open-source text search engine that provides 
      significantly-improved system response time compared to the previous version 
      of the FTS, an important consideration as the FTS now indexes over 615,000 
      pages of text. Lucene is also Unicode-aware, which will provide support 
      for non-English text in the future.<br>

    <P><b>JHOVE (JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment)</b> </P>
    <P>JHOVE, the JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment (pronounced 'jove') 
      is a software tool that was locally designed and developed for format-specific 
      identification, validation, and characterization of digital objects. The 
      ability to identify, validate, and characterize digital objects properly 
      is a fundamental requirement for effective long-term preservation. By fully 
      automating what had previously been a primarily manual process, JHOVE significantly 
      enhances the timeliness and sophistication with which preservation institutions 
      are able to deal the ever increasing amounts of digital data requiring preservation 
      handling. JHOVE provides support for the most prevalent digital formats 
      routinely used for representing audio (AIFF, WAVE), image (GIF, JPEG, JPEG 
      2000, TIFF), text (ASCII, UTF-8), and document (PDF, XML) content, but is 
      designed as an extensible framework to facilitate the integration of additional 
      formats over time. OIS is integrating JHOVE into the Digital Repository 
      Service (DRS) workflows for deposit, archival storage, and preservation 
      planning. Beyond Harvard, JHOVE has gained widespread international acceptance 
      and use by most major library and archival institutions with significant 
      digital library and preservation programs.<br>

    <H3>New Project Announcements</H3>
    <BLOCKQUOTE> 
      <p><b>Google Project </b><br>
        In December, 2004 the University announced that it had entered into a 
        pilot agreement with Google to investigate the possibility of digitizing 
        much or all of the bound-volume collection of Harvard's libraries. The 
        digitized data would be used by Google to provide searching across the 
        full content of books (thus providing a new way for readers to search 
        for materials in the Harvard collection). In addition, a copy of the data 
        would be returned to Harvard for future use. The pilot project involves 
        digitizing a sample of library books to allow both the University and 
        Google to explore such issues as workflow, possible damage to books caused 
        by the digitization project, the quality of the data created through Google's 
        unique digitization process, the integration of Google's systems and services 
        with those of the Harvard libraries, and costs. In addition, Harvard wanted 
        to have time to gather reactions from the many communities (Harvard students 
        and faculty, alumni, other libraries and universities, publishers and 
        authors) that were expected to be interested in the project.<br>

      <p><b>Archive Ingest and Handling Test (AIHT)</b><br>
        Harvard University participated in the Archive Ingest and Handling Test 
        (AIHT) organized by the Library of Congress as part of its National Digital 
        Information Infrastructure Preservation Program (NDIIPP) initiative. The 
        intent of the test was to assess the feasibility of large-scale transfer 
        of digital resources between institutions utilizing quite different technical 
        infrastructures. The test corpus was a collection of over 57,000 files 
        (13 TB) in more than 100 data formats, provided with no accompanying technical 
        metadata. The technical metadata required for deposit into the Digital 
        Repository Service (DRS) was automatically extracted from the files themselves. 
        The test successfully proved that the four project participants could 
        import and export the data amongst themselves, despite the heterogeneity 
        of their repository systems, variously using RDBMS, XML, grid storage, 
        and MPEG-21 technologies. This project phase did uncover a few deficiencies 
        in the DRS in dealing with arbitrary, web-harvested content, rather than 
        with the highly-curated materials typically deposited. These issues will 
        be addressed in future DRS system enhancements. A further stage of the 
        AIHT project involved the systematic migration of objects in the collection. 
        The investigation included the automated transformation of GIF, JPEG, 
        and TIFF images (over 15,000 files) to the JPEG 2000 format. The systems 
        and workflows devised for this transformative process will be incorporated 
        in the DRS in the future, providing collection managers with the option 
        to request retrospective conversion of existing visual resources. </p>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Harvard University Library (HUL) has received a grant from the Andrew 
        W. Mellon Foundation for the development of a registry of authoritative 
        representation information about digital formats. Detailed representation 
        information, which defines the syntactic and semantic rules by which content 
        is encoded in digital form, is fundamental to the preservation of digital 
        resources. The two-year project will result in a new Global Digital Format 
        Registry (GDFR), which will become a key international infrastructure 
        component for the digital preservation programs of libraries, archives 
        and other institutions with the responsibility for keeping digital resources 
        viable over time. </P>
      <P>The wide diversity and rapid pace of adoption and abandonment of digital 
        formats present an ongoing problem for long-term preservation efforts. 
        Preservation programs must document the format of the objects they are 
        preserving. Without precise knowledge of format, a digital object is merely 
        a collection of undifferentiated bits. Creating a shared registry will 
        save an enormous amount of duplicative effort in acquiring and recording 
        such documentation. It also allows the community to share expertise in 
        formats, so that each institution does not require deep local expertise 
        in every format of data it is preserving.</P>
      <P> GDFR will be established as a distributed service in which participating 
        research libraries, archives, and other organizations with preservation 
        responsibilities can contribute, as well as use, format-typing information<br>

    <h3>The Library Digital Initiative (LDI)</h3>
    <p>Harvard University launched the LDI in July 1998 to develop the University's 
      capacity to manage digital information by creating a robust technical infrastructure 
      for the acquisition, organization, delivery, and archiving of digital library 
      materials; by providing a team of specialists to advise librarians and others 
      in the University community on key issues in the digital environment; by 
      providing librarians and staff with experience in digital library projects; 
      and by enriching the Harvard University Library system with a significant 
      set of digital resources. Now in its eighth year, LDI is making it easier 
      for Harvard's libraries to maintain their collections and services in the 
      digital era, without each library having to individually acquire the expertise 
      and systems needed to support digital resources. The development of the 
      collections, systems and services documented in this report were funded 
      by LDI.<br>
      <a href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ldi">http://hul.harvard.edu/ldi</a> </p>
    <H3>The Digital Acquisitions Program</H3>
    <P>Initiated as part of LDI, the Digital Acquisitions Program supports the 
      shared purchase and licensing of commercially available digital resources 
      for Harvard's libraries. Program services include the organization of prospective 
      and ongoing product evaluation, license negotiation, access implementation 
      and administration, and vendor relationship management. Consulting assistance 
      is also offered to libraries that negotiate license agreements for their 
      local collections. Program staff are also involved in assisting libraries 
      with collection decisions involving print resources, such as canceling unneeded 
      duplicate print journal subscriptions in order to control acquisitions. 
      During FY 2005, approximately 709 new resources - including 645 e-journals 
      and 64 databases - were licensed and made available to the Harvard community 
      through the Harvard Libraries web site. User sessions on commercial resources 
      increased 22% this year from 4,269,955 to 5,193,132.<br>

    <h3>LDI Internal Challenge Grant Program</h3>
    <P> Managers and staff throughout Harvard’s libraries, archives, museums and 
      special collections have participated in LDI through the Internal Challenge 
      Grant Program. They have assisted LDI by prioritizing, testing and demonstrating 
      new systems and services while contributing valuable online content for 
      research and education. Projects have had a range of goals including basic 
      digital conversion of a single collection; the creation of a virtual collection 
      by digitizing related material from multiple repositories; and the development 
      of new delivery systems for natively digital material. Many projects have 
      focused on providing access to previously inaccessible collections and making 
      them available online for use by students and scholars at Harvard and around 
      the world. To date, the LDI grant program has funded 42 projects through 
      which more than 200 Harvard staff members have gained experience in working 
      with digital projects. seven projects were completedIn FY 2005, . Four projects 
      employed LDI's Management Assistance and Planning programs (LDI MAP), a 
      cost-recovery service that has provided customized, hands-on assistance 
      to managers of LDI grant-funded projects. New grants in FY06 will focus 
      on archiving web sites. <br>

    <P><b>Open Collections Program (OCP)</b></P>
    <p>Through Harvard's Open Collections Program, resources from Harvard's libraries 
      are made available online to benefit students and teachers around the world. 
      With the generous support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and 
      the Lisbet Rausing Charitable Fund, the Open Collections Program (OCP) is 
      developing efficient, replicable methods for the creation of comprehensive, 
      subject-based digital resources drawn from the holdings of Harvard library 
      system. The goal is to create a new model for digital collections that will 
      benefit the Harvard community and the general public alike. In FY2005, OCP 
      completed their pilot collection, Women Working, 1800-1930 and began work 
      on their second collection, Emigration and Immigration, 1789-1930 which 
      will focus on immigration to the United States.<br>
