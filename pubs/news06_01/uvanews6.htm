      <h3>Albemarle County Aerial Photographs Index: 1957, 1966 and 1974</h3>

<p>This collection provides access to comprehensive collections of historical aerial photographs of Albemarle County, Virginia and the City of Charlottesville. Over 900 photographs, originally produced by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were scanned at 1200 dpi by the UVa Library's Digital Library Production Services. A GIS-based finding aid was developed to allow users to make accurate selections by overlaying street and water data on centerpoints of the photographs. Plans are underway to include photographs from the 1980s in coming months. Downloads include JPEG images and xml metadata files.

<h3> The Carmichael Letters: "Patient's Voices in Early 19th Century Virginia"</h3>
<p> In 1998 the University of Virginia Libraries purchased a 700-piece collection of the correspondence and daybook of Dr. James Carmichael and his son, Dr. Edward Carmichael, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. The daybook, a record of credits and debits to their medical practice between 1816 and 1817, is the only document composed by the Carmichaels. The unique feature of the collection is that the letters, dated 1819 through 1830, are written primarily by patients or their family members. 
The letters provide interesting details describing nineteenth-century
medical treatments and drugs and patients&rsquo; reactions to them. The correspondence also explores the health and medical care of slaves.

<h3> In Search of Native Azaleas: Henry Skinner's 1951 Southern Collecting Trip </h3>
<p>Between March and August, 1951, Henry T. Skinner drove 
25,000 miles through the southeastern and eastern United States 
searching for native azaleas. From this field survey, 
approximately 8,000 herbarium specimens and 500 living plants 
were sent to the Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia.  During his travels, Dr. Skinner kept notes and 
lists of the azaleas he found in a two-volume Southern 
Collecting Trip Record Book that is now part of the Henry Thomas Skinner Papers in the Special Collections Department of the University of Virginia. Dr. Skinner also prepared daily Notes of Southern Collecting Trip Routes, and a year after his trip in August, 1952, he made a list of the 500 plants he had sent back to the Morris Arboretum; this list is entitled "Native Azaleas." This project includes images of the handwritten Record Book and Notes of Routes, with transcriptions, and images of the list of the Native Azaleas.

<h3><em>Vanity Fair</em> Caricatures</h3>
<p>Over a span of nearly fifty years (1868-1914), the society magazine <em>Vanity Fair </em> established its reputation as one of the most popular and respected periodicals in English journalism. In its second year of publication, founder Thomas Gibson Bowles (1842-1922) decided to include in each issue a caricature of a prominent figure of the time. These color lithographs became the most recognizable feature of the magazine and are considered valuable collector's items today. 
This selection of <em>Vanity Fair </em> prints is part of a larger collection compiled by the late Cecil Y. Lang, Professor of English at the University of Virginia from 1967 to 1991. Noted for editing the letters of Victorian poet Matthew Arnold, Lang used the prints as a resource in identifying some of the individuals mentioned in Arnold 's correspondence. Lang donated his collection to the University Library in 2002. The gift comprised 900 of these remarkable portraits, each showcasing a noteworthy personality of the Victorian era.

<h3>Production Services </h3>
     <blockquote>
	 <h4>Digital Library Production Services</h4>
      <p>DLPS is charged with building a sustainable core digital 
        collection befitting a world-class institution of higher learning. DLPS 
        strives to create and maintain a cost-effective, efficient production 
       line for producing consistent and preservable data.&nbsp;Among its recent projects, DLPS worked with stakeholders to review the high-level and 
micro workflows needed to properly move an image from digitizing through cataloging and ingestion into the Digital Library Repository. This workflow, when implemented in Fall 2005, 
will ensure a smoother and quicker processing and delivery of images. 
DLPS also developed a comprehensive web-based tracking system for text digitization.

</p>
      
<h4>Prototype for Resource Sharing</h4>
  <p>The Rare Materials Digital Services unit is working to implement
  a prototype project that will allow other units within the university to digitize
  their materials under their auspices. The goals for this prototype service include giving units that do not have access to resources required to digitize 
such materials the ability to do so in a standardized manner and provide them with the training and expertise they need; the unification of digital production 
and metadata creation standards for rare materials that will eventually be ingested into 
the Digital Library Repository; to provide units to share expenses with other units in a mutually beneficial manner; to allow other units to "test" hardware to determine whether or not they want 
to purchase their own; to identify a need within the 
library system for such services and include in resource planning; and to revisit the library's digital services support model for specialized services.

    <h3>Fedora&#8482;</h3>
    <p>The University of Virginia Library' s Digital Library Research and Development 
      Group is continuing to collaborate with Cornell to develop Fedora. Phase 
      2 focuses on the development of tools, utilities, and new interfaces 
      for creating objects and submitting content; tools to support migration 
      of existing digital collections into Fedora; enhancements to better enable 
      the creation, management, and delivery of distributed, virtual collections; 
      better integration with 3rd party search engines; support for alternative 
      search interfaces to the native Fedora indexes that conform to emerging 
      international standards such as SRW; development of a set of integrity and 
      management features; and enabling the creation of peer-to-peer networks 
      of Fedora repositories. Version 2.1 beta was released on October 24, 2005.

    <h3>Digital Library Repository</h3>
    <p>In March 2002, UVA Library and Cornell University began work on Fedora&#8482;, 
      and, alongside it, UVA began work on its first phase prototype of a Digital Library Repository. The first version production 
      Repository and its end-user interface was released to the UVA community 
      for its initial experimental year in October, 2004. Following a year of testing and assessment, approximately 15,000 images, almost 400 electronic texts, and over 3,000 UVA 
      Special Collections finding aids have been loaded into the Repository. Users 
      may search by metadata across all collection formats, or search full-text 
      in each individual collection. All images and page image retrieved are accompanied 
      by menus that allow the user to view the image in an ImageViewer (zooming, 
      panning, brightness and contrast, rotating), or collect the image into personal 
      portfolios using the Digital Object Collector Tool. Access to content is 
      currently limited to the University of Virginia.<br />
    <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/collections/">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/collections/</a></p>

    <h3>Digital Object Collector Tool</h3>
    <p>UVA Library's Object Collector Tool is a Java-based desktop tool that allows 
      a user to &quot;collect&quot; references to images (including page images) 
      retrieved via searches of the Central Digital Repository. Menus that accompany 
      all images initiate the collection process. An Object Collection window 
      allows a user to organize images into one or more collection portfolios. 
      The references to these images can be saved to the user's local drive or 
      to a mapped network location as an XML file. The Collector Tool also includes 
      the same ImageViewer (zooming, panning, rotating) as is available to online 
      users of the Repository. The Collector Tool can be used to create slides 
      shows for use in the classroom, or HTML web pages for use as image reserves. 
      The functionality of the Collector Tool will be expanded to include the 
      ability to collect electronic texts and additional formats over time.<br />

     <h3>General Descriptive Modeling Scheme (GDMS) </h3>
    <p>Development has continued on GDMS, a DTD developed to create XML files 
      that are structured, annotated descriptions of digital collections. An infinitely 
      recursive set of structural units: each may contain a narrative, a descriptive 
      metadata record and references to, and metadata about, any number of digital 
      resources. GDMS is being tested in several faculty digital projects to describe 
      buildings, archeological sites and artworks, creating structural metadata 
      for digital objects that provide access to related sets of digital images. 
      GDMS has now been incorporated into its first production system, serving 
      as the XML standard used for Art &amp; Architecture objects in the UVA Library 
      Central Digital repository.<br />

    <h3>Metadata Specifications: UVA DescMeta and UVA AdminMeta</h3>
    <p>Development has continued on the UVA DescMeta and AdminMeta by our Cataloging 
      department and Digital Library Research and Development. The goal is to 
      produce a local set of descriptive elements for specifying the intellectual 
      content of digital resources and administrative elements describing the 
      provenance, source, rights, and technical specifications of each datastream 
      in a digital object. Initially derived from the Dublin Core specification, 
      they have been adapted and extended for local use. The UVA Library has developed 
      DTDs, crosswalks to other standards, and use guidelines. <br />

<h3>User Collection Tool</h3>

<p>The User Collection Tool is a web-based application developed using MySQL and PHP by the Robertson Media Center for the management, organization, and annotation of personal media collections (images, video, audio, etc.) from any web browser in any location. 
The Tool can be used to organize media into different categories, enter and maintain metadata about the media files, publish galleries on the Web, and export XML files in the UVa GDMS format.

<h2>A. Projects</h2>

<h3>New Project Announcements</h3>

    <blockquote> 
      <h3>Digital Herbarium</h3>
      <p>For more than 80 years, biology researchers have traveled to the Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia's Appalachian Mountains to explore the area's pristine and diverse flora and fauna. Library staff are now working with UVa faculty to digitize thousands of plant specimens to both preserve the fragile originals and make the collections more generally available. </p>
      <div>

        <h3>Georeferenced Charlottesville Sanborn Maps, 1907 and 1920</h3>
        <p>In this enhancement project, two sets of Sanborn maps owned by the University were georeferenced and new finding aids and access tools developed. Previously digitized by an outside service, the maps were re-scanned by UVA's Rare Materials Digital Services to remove spatial distortion created by crowning and other artifacts of the print materials. The maps were then georeferenced to historical aerial photos, and new street name and browsable map indices are being developed. Due to go online in November 2005. </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Framework for Digitization</h3>
      <p>Staff from Content Management Services and the Collections Group developed  a Framework for Digitization that outlines priorities for all Library materials and formats for digitization and inclusion in the Digital Library Repository. <br />
        <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/reports/framework_digitization.html">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/reports/framework_digitization.html      </a></p>

      <h3>Project Access </h3>
      <p>The goal of Project Access is to implement a suite of products intended to improve access to content and services for users and staff.&nbsp;The scope of the project includes implementation of Director&rsquo;s Station (Reporting), iLink (OPAC), Relais (Inter library Loan), Resolver (OpenURL resolver), and SingleSearch (Metasearch). In a companion project, the Library's web site will also be redesigned to better integrate the updated and new services. As of fall 2005, Resolver is in production as Find@UVA, iLink and SingleSearch are undergoing usability testing, and Relais and Director's Station are nearing the completion of their configuration. </p>
      <h3>UVa Community Digitization Guidelines</h3>
      <p>The Library has developed a document that provides guidance and minimum recommendations for the digitization of images, texts, and data that are in line with the Library's current practice for members of the UVa community who are planning digitization projects.<br />
        <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/reports/uva_digitization_guidelines.html">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/reports/uva_digitization_guidelines.html</a></p>

      <h3>UVa Image Collections</h3>
      <p>Staff from the Fiske Kimball Fine Arts Library collaborated with their counterparts in the McIntire Department of Art, as well as with staff from Cataloging and the Digital Library Production Service, to create a virtual union of their two separate collections. Combined workflows are under development for production, and approximately 10,000 images have been cataloged, digitized, and loaded into the Digital Library Repository for use by a small group of faculty who will use the images and tools in instruction. </p>
      <h3>UVa TEI Guidelines</h3>
      <p>Staff from DLPS developed extensive TEI markup practices guidelines for use by keyboarding vendors and in local practice. <a

<h3>Update on Existing Projects</h3>

    <blockquote> 
      <h3>Japanese Text Initiative</h3>
        <p>The Japanese Text Initiative (JTI) now delivers its recently processed texts dynamically through XML, replacing its static HTML delivery of previous editions. These new titles display Japanese etexts in both horizontal and the traditional vertical formats, and with and without "furigana" (aka "rubi"), small characters that appear about or beside the text as a phonetic comment and reading aid.<br />

      <h3><b>The Renaissance in Print: Sixteenth-Century French Books in the Douglas Gordon Collection</b></h3>
      <p>Rare Materials Digital Services and the University of Virginia French Department received additional funding from the Florence Gould Foundation to digitize additional rare books from the French Renaissance era and make them accessible to the public on the Web.  The online collection includes over 100 digital facsimiles of sixteenth-century printed books in the <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/speccol//collections/gordon.html">Douglas H. Gordon Collection</a> and an on-line network of resources designed to situate the books within the rich context of the French Renaissance.<br />

</p>

        <h3>The Virginia Elections and State Elected Officials Database Project, 1776-2005</h3>
        <p>Election data for Virginia candidates running for U.S. Congress back to the 1960s, election and service data for candidates in 2004 elections, and campaign finance data for candidates running for state office in 2005 were included this year. Congressional data were added by students in a Politics class, who then used the query functions of the site to analyze the data they had entered. This process required Library development of online entry forms and data verification processes, which will be used to help develop systems to sustain regular updates of the site.<br />

<h2>B. Programs</h2>

<h3>Collaborative Community Projects</h3>
<p>The UVa Library is participating in a number of collaborative collection building and best practices projects, including the American West project at the California Digital Library, DLF Aquifer, DLF's Distributed Library: 
  OAI for Digital Library Aggregation project, and the Open Content Alliance.
</p>

<h3>Scholarly Communication Institute</h3>
<p>With sponsorship by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) and funding from the Andrew Mellon Foundation, 
the UVA Library hosted the third in a series of Scholarly Communication Institutes. The SCI 
Scholarly Communication Institute (SCI) was funded to "provide
an opportunity for leaders in the field [of scholarly communication] to study,
plan, and organize institutional and discipline-based strategies for advancing
the state of scholarly communication. Participants will be challenged to
imagine the ideal scholarly communication system, and what the changing nature
of scholarly inquiry might look like in such a system."<br />

<h3>Sustaining Digital Scholarship </h3>
<p>The Supporting Digital Scholarship initiative is working to determine how the Library can select, collect, and preserve scholarly 
digital projects.&nbsp; The working group includes faculty, Library selectors, and staff from Production and Technology Services.&nbsp; Pilot  implementation projects are in the planning state for three born digital works of scholarship.</p>

<h1><a name="sec3" id="sec3">III. Specific Digital Library Challenges</a></h1>

<div class="challenges">
<h2>Sustaining Digital Scholarship</h2>
      
    <p>The UVA Library sees it as vital that we collect and preserve digital scholarship. 
      To that end, the Library is developing assessment standards and workflows 
      through which subject librarians will review and select digital faculty 
      research projects for processing and formal addition into the Library's 
      collections. This requires the development of standards and processes for 
      technical assessment of works alongside the more traditional assessment 
      of their content, as well as the development of deposit agreements between 
      the Library and faculty to collect and deliver their digital research. A 
      companion issue is the development of holistic production and metadata standards 
      that apply to the Library production and to production of digital projects 
      by the greater UVA community.</p>

      <h2>Encoding and Enforcement of Access Restrictions</h2>
      <p>UVA would like to be able to apply community standards to the encoding 
        of rights, and to establish a policy for the use of a digital object that 
        could be matched with the characteristics of the user making the request.&nbsp; 
        Under consideration is the use of a digital certificate to authenticate 
        the user coupled with a set of policies for either the objects and/or 
        their components.</p>

      <h2>Scalability of Production</h2>
      <p>UVA is looking at the development of more efficient and effective workflows 
        for digital content production, encompassing new local production, processing 
        of licensed content for local mounting, and migration of legacy content 
        to new standards and delivery systems.</p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p>As digital resources become more numerous and more complex, attempts to meaningfully assess access, use, and costs relating to their development become more difficult at the same time that they become more crucial. The UVa Library's Balanced Scorecard Committee is working to develop new measures and strategies for assessment of digital resources and services.</p>
