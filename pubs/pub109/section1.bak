<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/hr.gif" width="500" height="24" border="0"

Digital libraries are new, and investment in them is fraught with
unknowns. Consequently, librarians and library directors are
hungry for information about different institutional experiences,
including what digital library investments are considered good,
meaningful, and cost-effective, and what influences have helped
shape successful digital library programs. To respond to these
needs, the Digital Library Federation (DLF) undertook a study of
its members' digital library programs.<sup><a
href="#n1">1</a></sup> The survey was intended to document how DLF
member libraries are focusing their digital library programs: how
and under what circumstances their programs were initiated; the
influences that shaped their development; the programs' current
organization and funding; and the challenges they anticipate. The
primary aim of the study was to help inform libraries in their
strategic planning and help them assess their own programs in
light of what others have set out to achieve. The study had a
number of secondary aims as well; for example, to identify what
new roles are emerging for academic libraries; to assess the
opportunities and pitfalls that may be associated with these new
roles; and to help libraries promote themselves to their
faculties and to the university administrators to whom they
report. 

<p>The study began with a survey questionnaire circulated to the
academic libraries that were members of the DLF in January 2001.
Twenty-one institutions responded.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>
The data they supplied were illuminating on several points,
including the different approaches that libraries have taken to
build their digital library programs and the extent to which the
complexion of any program is tied to campus personalities,
circumstances, and needs (Greenstein, Thorin, and McKinney 2001).
The data compelled a closer look at the softer influences not so
readily identified by a survey. Accordingly, extensive interviews
were conducted with key staff members at six DLF member
libraries: the California Digital Library (CDL), Harvard
University, Indiana University, New York University (NYU), the
University of Michigan, and the University of Virginia.</p>

<p>These six programs were selected because they represented
distinct variations in attributes that the survey identified as
being potentially key determinants of a program's
distinctiveness. Among those attributes is age. Virginia and
Michigan are two of the oldest digital library programs in the
United States. NYU was included because it is a relatively new
program, begun in earnest only in the last two years. Harvard and
Indiana represent the middle-age members of the sample.</p>

<p>Another distinguishing characteristic is a program's
orientation&mdash;that is, the main focus of its work. Not all
digital libraries focus primarily on digitally reformatting
analog items in their collections and distributing them online.
Harvard and NYU, while possessing digitization capacity, focus
principally on providing systems environments and infrastructure
capable of managing digital assets as may be acquired or used
within their host institution. The CDL is similarly focused but
is actively assessing funding and business models that may
support more investment in digitization. Michigan has focused
both on digitization and on the development of access systems.
Indiana stresses digitization in the context of teaching and
learning. Virginia, on the other hand, emphasizes innovative use
of information technology (IT) in support of research and
teaching. Its main focus is consequently user services, with
collections and system development playing a supporting role. The
range in orientation of DLF digital libraries is illustrated by
data from the DLF survey. In the year 2000, digital conversion
costs for member libraries ranged between $38,000 and $1,145,000;
the average spending on all aspects of digital library programs
was $4,341,798 ($2,641,798 if the costs of acquiring access to
commercial electronic content are excluded). Fewer than half of
the DLF libraries surveyed invest primarily in digital
reformatting programs. Most have oriented themselves toward the
development of technical infrastructure and of various reference
and other end-user services.</p>

<p>A third characteristic used to select programs for case study
interviews was organization. Information about how digital
library programs are organized is available for 18 of the DLF's
members. Two&mdash;Harvard and the CDL&mdash;are confederal
organizations to which a number of libraries contribute at some
level. Harvard's program supports the more than 90 libraries that
make up the Harvard library system. The California Digital
Library is a library in its own right, but it provides services
to faculty, students, and libraries at the 10 University of
California (UC) campuses. As confederated organizations, Harvard
and CDL are unique within the DLF as well as among academic
libraries generally. An additional six DLF member digital library
programs are managed as separate departments or units within the
library. Michigan and Indiana are representative of this
approach. The University of Virginia represents another
organizational form&mdash;one in which digital library effort is
found in several library departments but coordinated through a
committee. This distributed but coordinated approach is common to
4 of the 18 DLF members for whom organizational details are
known. Two further approaches were evident in the survey data but
are not represented in the case studies because they are
indicative of very small and immature programs. Two DLF member
libraries reported in the survey that their programs were too
small to have some determinate organizational form, while a
further four claimed that their programs comprised a range of
uncoordinated activities taking place in different library
departments.</p>

<p>A final attribute that distinguishes a digital library program
is the library's relationship with surrounding academic
departments and information services, such as academic computing
and IT. Although not easily quantifiable, closeness may be
measured by such factors as the facility and experience of
collaboration between the library and these surrounding
departments, and the extent to which strategic planning in one
department includes representatives from and takes substantive
account of planning in other departments. Size may have something
to do with closeness. Among the surveyed institutions, Virginia
and NYU are the smallest and also have the closest relationship
with other departments. They are joined by Indiana, however,
which, at more than 33,500 students on the Bloomington campus
alone, can hardly be characterized in terms that describe a
liberal arts college "feel." Harvard and CDL, because of their
confederal character, are perhaps furthest from faculty and IT
units. This study, although based on the results of the survey
and interviews, has also been informed by other investigations
that the DLF has sponsored in its attempt to understand various
aspects of the digital library and by the numerous formal and
informal discussions that have supported or resulted from those
investigations.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup></p>

<h2>Aspiration and the "Skunk Works": The Young Digital
Library</h2>

<a id="origins" name="origins"></a> 

<h3>Origins</h3>

The circumstances surrounding the launch of a digital library
program vary considerably, but it is possible to point to several
important common influences. Among them are a guiding mission, an
institution-wide mandate, the support of library and university
leaders, a protected experimental environment, and sufficient
funding. Each of these influences is developed in greater detail
in this chapter, which will then characterize the aims and
orientation of early digital library programs. <a id="mission"
name="mission"></a>
<h4>Mission</h4>

Digital library programs are initiated for different reasons, any
one or more of which may be at work at a single institution. Most
programs derive from innovative thinking about the future role of
libraries (for example at Virginia) or the future role of the
library in an extensively networked teaching and learning
environment (Michigan), but there are other motivations. The role
of blue-sky planning may be particularly significant at
institutions that entered the digital library business early and
had few models to draw on. Institutions that entered later could
be imitative as well as creative. In this regard, it is worth
noting that academic institutions compete at nearly every level:
they compete for grant and philanthropic funding, good students,
and respected faculty. Their libraries are not immune from
competitive impulses, which also have a hand in initiating
digital library investments. Thus, the progress of digital
library programs that are located at a library's peer
institutions cannot be discounted as a powerful driver. 

<p>In sum, we encountered digital library programs that were
developed</p>

<ul>
<li>as part of a campus-wide initiative to develop as a leader in
the use of information technology;</li>

<li>as a means of modernizing overall university services to
attract better students;</li>

<li>to keep up with the digital library programs being developed
at peer institutions; and</li>

<li>as a commitment to the delivery of high-quality library
services.</li>
</ul>

Most of the programs we surveyed are at some level deploying
innovative technologies to deliver very traditional library
services. For example, Harvard's Libraries Digital Initiative is
preparing to collect and preserve scholarly and cultural outputs
that happen to be in digital form, and to encourage their use in
research and teaching. NYU's digital library program is
supporting an institution that has a strong cross-disciplinary
interest in theoretical and applied aspects of the performing
arts. Michigan is supporting the development and conservation of
out-of-copyright monograph and serial holdings and efforts to
provide highly functional access to digital content. Indiana is
using streaming audio to deliver listening assignments to
students in its School of Music. <a id="lead" name="lead"></a> 

<h4>Leadership and Ownership</h4>

Leadership is required at three levels: the political, the
creative, and the executive. Political leadership may stem from
the university librarian, as it has at Harvard, Virginia,
Indiana, and NYU. NYU is an interesting case. It is a latecomer
to the digital library arena in part because there was no IT or
library leadership until a new president was appointed, who, in
turn, selected a new chief information officer (CIO) and a dean
of libraries. 

<p>Whether a library director's support is sufficient to launch a
successful digital library program remains an open question. The
hands of university presidents and provosts are clearly at work
in our case studies. Since 1995, UC President Atkinson has been a
great champion of the CDL. University of Michigan President
Duderstadt (1988&ndash;1996) identified issues surrounding an
information and IT agenda as being among his priorities. He
invested in the transformation that created a School of
Information and in the aggressive development of the technology
infrastructure. Both ultimately benefited Michigan's digital
library interests.</p>

<p>Creative leadership, another important ingredient, comes from
a number of sources. At Michigan, it emerged from close
collaboration among three people: one in the School of
Information and Library Studies (now the School of Information),
one in the university's Information Technology Division, and one
in the library. Such collaboration is apparent at Harvard, in a
triumvirate whose members are drawn from within the university's
library system; at NYU, in a combination that is orchestrated and
shared by the dean of libraries and the CIO; and at Indiana, in a
group modeled closely on Michigan's and comprising members of the
library, the IT service, the library school, and the School of
Informatics. Creative leadership can also stem from an
individual. At Virginia, the digital library program owes a great
deal to a single librarian who, in the 1980s, was already
thinking deeply about what a twenty-first-century academic
library should be.</p>

<p>The need for executive leadership is self-evident. No digital
library program, however well supported and envisioned, can
develop without people who possess the appropriate technical,
tactical, and even diplomatic skills. Programs that otherwise had
key elements in place, such as funding and mission orientation,
were delayed to some extent until such leadership could be found.
This was the case at Indiana and NYU.</p>

<p>Just as digital library leadership is required at several
levels, ownership of the digital library program needs to be felt
widely across its host institution. This may be less important
for the startup phase of a digital library program than for its
long-term operation. All six programs represented in the case
studies traced their origins to inclusive strategic planning
exercises&mdash;exercises that involved academic faculty, senior
university managers, some library staff, and, in some cases,
representatives of other information services. Representatives of
Michigan's triumvirate traced their program's origins to a
planning process that included a yearlong, campus-wide faculty
symposium on electronic information and a report prepared for
campus administration on this process. The work included
intensive analysis of distributed computing operations and the
economics of campus information provision. NYU's mandate stems
from library and IT planning vetted by faculty advisory groups
and university administration. Harvard's stems from a planning
committee that included deans, librarians, and faculty. CDL's
grew from a planning process that was initiated by librarians but
was ultimately ceded to a committee comprising representatives of
all constituencies: faculty senate, campus administration,
system-wide administration, information technologists, and
libraries. The committee itself was instituted by the chancellors
(campus chief executives) and the university provost. Of the 21
digital libraries surveyed, 76.2 percent (16) are guided by
digital library development policies created as part of a broader
university IT strategy. These data suggest that digital library
development is at some level conceived as part of a
university-wide planning process. <a id="organized"
name="organized"></a></p>

<h4>Organizational Location</h4>

Foundling digital library initiatives seem to favor safe-haven
environments where those involved can experiment without the
operational demands made of other library units. Michigan created
a "skunk works"&mdash;a research laboratory where digital library
staff could, through a series of highly focused projects, "road
test" new technologies and gain competencies in key areas. The
reliance on digital library laboratories is apparent in both
early- and late-starting programs. At Michigan, the early program
involved a number of projects loosely coordinated by a program
director and fulfilling the evolving vision of the founding
triumvirate. Early work with the JSTOR project and with the
Making of America provided a range of experiences associated with
large-scale digital reformatting, while cooperation with Elsevier
Science (in projects TULIP and PEAK) provided data management
experience as well as a context for a large-scale field
experiment in pricing electronic journals. Crucially, the digital
library program was outside the library's normal management line:
its director was responsible to the triumvirate. She was also
physically independent from the library's key operational
services. 

<p>The model of a digital library program that is relatively
autonomous in its early days is evident elsewhere with
significant variation. Virginia cut its digital library teeth in
experimental units that were outside the normal line of
management&mdash;in the library's Electronic Text Center and, in
the academic unit, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
Humanities (IATH), which is located in the main library. Through
a series of digital library projects, staff (and through the
staff, the library) gained competence in creating, managing, and
distributing electronic information. The Electronic Text Center
was located in the library but was initially independent of other
library departments and services. Even IATH reported directly to
the associate provost for research and was thus removed to some
extent from the "academic line." Virginia continued for some time
to foster experimental efforts in relatively autonomous
organizational units. Thus, as it sought to develop experience
and capacity with new digital materials (e.g., images,
statistical data), it opened new media centers that focused on
the technical and other challenges that these materials
introduced without being clouded by traditional library practices
or even by practices that were growing up around the Electronic
Text Center and IATH.</p>

<p>Indiana's program introduces a variation on the same theme.
Here one can point to a number of experimental initiatives, each
mounted with a considerable degree of autonomy from mainstream
operational departments and from one another. VARIATIONS,
originally an audio e-reserve, was a flagship project run out of
the Music Library as a personal project of that library's
director. The Library Electronic Text Resource Service (LETRS) is
an e-text center much like the one at Virginia. It is located in
the library but is relatively autonomous of the traditional
library departments. Digital Images Delivered Online (DIDO) was
an early experiment that served faculty in the School of Fine
Arts.</p>

<p>In 1996, Indiana established the Digital Library Program
(DLP), which brought together these three projects. Through
amalgamation, Indiana achieved economies and cross-fertilization
at virtually every level, enabling a more coherent approach to
research and development, selection and deployment of digital
library technologies, and staff appointments. Amalgamation was
not intended to bring the DLP into a more traditional library
unit and thus out of its skunk-works environment.
Organizationally, the DLP reports directly to the dean of
libraries rather than up the normal operational chain. Moreover,
the DLP is funded discretely, rather than from operational
budgets that support traditional library services.
Programmatically, initiatives are still mounted at least in part
to build on digital library competencies as they accrue, to add
staff to complement skills already in place, and to acquire
technology as may be needed across the program.</p>

<p>Trajectories at Harvard and the University of California
differ from those at Indiana, reflecting the programs' confederal
nature and system-wide orientation. At Harvard, the digital
library program grew out of technical services developed on a
system-wide basis, notably around shared cataloging needs. The
CDL was instituted in parallel with a system-wide technical
service (the Department of Library Automation), which it then
subsumed. Although evolving from these more established services,
digital library initiatives at CDL and Harvard also took on at
least some of the attributes of the skunk works. Thus, while CDL
made a point of launching at least one new operational service
every six months, it fashioned numerous experimental initiatives
and even established a small unit under a director for education
and strategic innovation. At Harvard, where the Library Digital
Initiative was organizationally housed in the same unit that
supplied system-wide technical services, the program's emphasis
on digital library infrastructure assumed a five-year development
path during which time few infrastructural components became
operational. The program was seen as a highly practical applied
research program that would lead ultimately, but not immediately,
to the development of operational systems.</p>

<p>The digital library's initial locus in experimental units a
step or more outside the traditional management line was
important. It created a space where experimentation could happen
in a way that could not disappoint the service expectations of
faculty and students, or even of other librarians. In some cases,
digital library staff members were spared the normal bureaucratic
decision making, hiring, staff development, and procurement
procedures that applied to other more traditional library
services.<sup><a href="4">4</a></sup> As such, they could more
quickly populate, launch, redirect, or even end experimental
initiatives, and could respond to funding, staffing, and other
opportunities as they arose. This nimbleness was secured at a
cost, however. With few exceptions, institutionally based digital
library programs (as opposed to programs such as those at Harvard
and CDL, which operated at least in part on a system-wide basis)
were challenged later to integrate their staff, work, and
thinking about library collections and services into the
mainstream of the library. <a id="funding"
name="funding"></a></p>

<h3>Funding</h3>

Funding&mdash;especially external grant funding&mdash;is
critically important to the startup digital library. Because it
reduces the risk inherent in highly uncertain and technologically
dependent activities, external grant funding is a mechanism that
is particularly appropriate for the experimental orientation of
embryonic digital library programs. Grant funding also gives
fledgling programs national stature and local legitimacy and
helps secure subsequent funding from external and internal
sources. Securing external funding depends to some extent,
however, on the ability to write convincing grant proposals and
on the use of marketing and promotional techniques that many
libraries have not yet developed and are not yet associated with
their digital library programs. 

<p>The need to promote digital library programs was felt acutely
by the programs that were launched in the early 1990s. At that
time, few of the agencies to which libraries had a natural or
historic entr&eacute;e were making any substantial investment in
activities that we would today associate with the digital
library. The National Science Foundation's (NSF's) DLI1
initiative changed the profile of digital library activities and
the amount of federal dollars that might be available to support
them. Libraries, however, did not appear on lists of the first
successful NSF digital library grants. The inexperience on both
sides of the funding fence only emphasized the importance of
marketing, as digital libraries were forced to consider how best
to present their research interests and needs to members of a
scientific community with which they had hitherto had only
limited contact.</p>

<p>The role of foundations (particularly The Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation but also the J. Paul Getty Foundation and the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation) was also important in kick-starting digital
library initiatives. Here too, however, libraries were obliged to
get themselves on the agencies' informal bidding lists and to
make their case for being there. It would be interesting to know
how many failed funding applications a digital library program
made on average before achieving its first success.<sup><a
href="#n5">5</a></sup> Certainly, such failures were earning
experiences that helped digital libraries focus their aims and
build their technology expertise. These experiences also helped
libraries learn to present their funding cases convincingly, in a
language that was comprehensible to those outside the library
community and in a way that demonstrated the broader significance
of their institution's own efforts.</p>

<p>No amount of external grant funding, however, can replace the
need for a substantial institutional commitment. So-called core
funding&mdash;whether obtained from gifts, from additions to the
library's permanent budget, or from a reallocation of existing
funds&mdash;was claimed as essential by all 15 of the survey
respondents who answered questions about how their digital
library programs are funded. Such commitment takes different
forms. At Michigan, Indiana, and NYU, it is in the form of
contributions from university departments that are co-investing
in the digital library's development. At Harvard and UC, local
funding flows directly to the digital library from the office of
the university president. At Virginia and Indiana, most startup
funding came from money the university librarian had reallocated
from other library purposes. Interestingly, as digital library
programs mature, reallocated library funding becomes more
important, at once reflecting and contributing to the challenges
of mainstreaming the digital library. <a id="char"
name="char"></a></p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

Because startup digital libraries are fundamentally experimental,
it is difficult to summarize what they do. They tend to set upon
experimental tasks that reflect purely local circumstances and
opportunities. Still, looking across a range of early
initiatives, it is possible to get a feel for the startup digital
library's practical orientation and for its rather severe
limitations. <a id="inno" name="inno"></a> 

<h4>Innovation</h4>

Very early programs&mdash;those from the early to
mid-1990s&mdash;are defined by the library's effort to harness
the Internet to fulfill historic roles. Although innovative in
many respects, these programs may be best characterized as "old
wine in new bottles." At least initially, the digital library
exploits the Internet as an additional means of delivering
traditional services, notably access to the library catalog and
to some reference materials and scholarly journals. 

<p>Greater innovation is apparent from the mid-1990s&mdash;for
example, in experimentation with digital reformatting. Surrounded
with lofty rhetoric about universal access to all human
knowledge, innovative scholarship and teaching, and national and
international digital libraries, some startup programs focused on
providing online access to selected holdings. It is too soon to
judge the results of these early initiatives. The risks involved
for early adopters may have been so great that they were forced
to exaggerate the claims for their work. Consequently, few of the
earliest digitally reformatted collections stood a chance of
meeting the expectations that grew up around them. Judged in
light of initial expectations, the earliest online collections
are, with notable exceptions</p>

<ul>
<li>too small to support more than very casual kinds of
browsing</li>

<li>too idiosyncratic to be integrated meaningfully into larger
virtual collections</li>

<li>too passive to maintain a user's interest for very long</li>
</ul>

Judged against more modest or realistic claims, however, early
digital collections were remarkably successful, particularly
since so many were developed as technical experiments rather than
as means of redefining scholarship. <a id="apps" name="apps"></a>


<h4>Quest for "Killer Apps"</h4>

The young digital library is also known for its quest for "killer
applications." Like the Holy Grail, these killer apps were
elusive and appeared to different seekers in very different
places&mdash;in data and metadata formats, in network protocols,
even in systems and system architectures. The logic of their
appeal is simple enough. Digital libraries are complicated to
build and hard to maintain. Complexity is compounded by the fact
that few libraries have more than a handful of appropriately
skilled research and development staff. The killer app was the
silver-bullet solution that promised to propel the library into a
networked age without undergoing the fundamental restructuring,
staff retraining, and soul-searching mission reorientation that
information technologies seem to have forced on virtually every
other organization known to late twentieth-century society. <a
id="compet" name="compet"></a> 

<h4>Competition</h4>

The young digital library is competitively disposed toward its
peers. Competition is hardly new; research libraries have always
vied for endowments, collections, and position. Where they are
embedded within academic institutions, as so many are, they are
part of a broader and possibly even more aggressive competitive
dynamic. The competitive disposition is notable only among young
digital libraries, because it runs contrary to the deep
information and service sharing that network technologies permit.
Perhaps competition at this stage can be explained by the risk
that early adopters embrace and by the need they feel to justify
that risk in terms of demonstrable innovation. Whatever the
cause, young digital libraries struggle to find distinctive
furrows to plow. Some attach themselves to systems or standards
that they hope will be codified in the ascendant. Others wed
themselves to collections that will redefine or inform whole
fields of inquiry. The competitive culture of online
experimentation may help explain the slow progress of standards
work into the mid- or late 1990s. Although few would question the
need for standards, young digital libraries have difficulty
agreeing on which standards&mdash;a question that is conceptually
equivalent to "whose standards," and that, consequently, cannot
easily be addressed on the true merits of any particular case
(Greenstein 2001). 

<p>The competitive dynamic is still apparent in startup digital
libraries, and it may be intensified as unsettled space on the
digital library frontier becomes more difficult to locate.
Interestingly, fewer startup programs appear to be staking their
claims on a particular technology or practice. Instead, they are
emphasizing service orientation (as at Carnegie Mellon, for
example, which emphasizes user support services) and local
collections and scholarship (as at NYU, whose digital library
program reflects a local orientation toward art and performance
across disciplines).</p>

<p>The competitive disposition of young digital libraries may
also help explain the relatively slow, sometimes fractious
progress of associations of digital libraries and of
collaborative digital initiatives. There are, to be sure,
interesting examples of fruitful information interchange and
shared investigation, particularly in the development of metadata
standards, e.g., the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Dublin Core,
and Encoded Archival Description (EAD).</p>

<p>One can also point to early and successful information
exchanges, notably the task forces, which still exist, sponsored
by the Coalition for Networked Information. Still, the ubiquitous
penetration of networked technologies creates opportunities for
deeper forms of association and resource sharing (with collection
development, for example) that have been left almost entirely
unexplored. Constrained organizationally from pushing
technologies to their logical extent, young digital libraries
fell back on safer modes of cooperation in talking shops that
explored new ideas and in shared cataloging activities. The
former resulted in statements of principle. The latter extended
the purview of shared cataloging to some nonbibliographic records
(e.g., archival finding aids and descriptions of some digitally
reformatted materials) and explored mechanisms for constructing
virtual, as opposed to union catalog, databases.</p>

<p>The young digital library is, in summary, an immature,
experimental organizational form. It explores new opportunities
and gathers new competencies. It does this within the safe harbor
of soft-money projects and other activities that are
organizationally, financially, and even culturally removed from
traditional library services. <a id="mdl" name="mdl"></a></p>

<h2>Rolling Projects into Programs: The Maturing Digital
Library</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/hr.gif" width="500" height="24" border="0"
align="top" alt="rule" /></p>

The developmental trajectories of digital library programs are as
diverse as are their origins. However, common trends begin to
emerge out of the experimental phases and into the mainstream of
library collections and services. The digital library program's
drift into the library mainstream occurs at practical, technical,
and organizational levels and requires new ways of thinking about
how programs are funded and promoted. These changes are explored
in this chapter, following a brief survey of how the digital
library's practical work and its orientation are also changed as
a consequence of its maturation. <a id="character"
name="character"></a> 

<h3>Characteristics</h3>

Practically speaking, the maturing digital library is transformed
as the fruits of experimental efforts become apparent in
operational online collections and services. Having acquired core
competencies and technical understanding, the maturing digital
library abandons the "build it and they will come" philosophy
that characterized earlier approaches to collection development.
It focuses instead on integrating digital materials into the
library's collections and on developing (and supporting with core
funding) the policies, technical capacities, and professional
skills needed to sustain it. Work by Timothy Jewell, Louis
Pitschmann, and Abby Smith demonstrates this trend across a range
of digital information. 

<p>Jewell (2001) shows the extent to which leading research
libraries have routinized the complex processes of identifying,
evaluating, negotiating access to, and supporting use of
electronic information that is commercially supplied by third
parties. Pitschmann (2001) demonstrates an evolving and highly
sophisticated understanding of the pitfalls, opportunities, and
real costs for libraries that choose to organize access to "free"
external Internet resources through various subject gateways,
portals, and other linking services. Smith (2001) demonstrates
that the digital libraries that were reformatting materials from
their collections in the late 1990s (and not all digital
libraries were), did so strategically rather than experimentally.
Reformatting was being done, for example, to profile selected
rare and special collections, to support specific teaching and
research needs, or to manage and conserve selected general
holdings. <a id="interest" name="interest"></a></p>

<h4>Interest in Modular Systems Architecture</h4>

Maturing digital libraries are far less interested in killer apps
than are young digital libraries. The maturing libraries view the
digital library as a complex online service environment that is
supported by local and global systems, each of which supplies
specific functions and interrelates with others in a way that can
be represented in a modular architectural schematic (Powell and
Lyon 2001). The model is not only sophisticated but also
practical and economical. It permits greater freedom in the
selection of service components and enables the library to manage
and respond to technical change with greater facility. Relying on
a modular systems architecture, the digital library can select a
new authentication service, for example, or integrate a new
authentication technology without re-engineering its entire
service environment. It can concern itself primarily with the
authentication system and the mechanism (the application
programming interface [API]) through which that system
communicates with others. This modular approach is fundamentally
liberating, because it permits libraries to think creatively
about how to build on services supplied by others. The extent to
which libraries are able to realize any part of the grander
vision, however, depends almost entirely on their ability to
transcend their historic organizational independence and
insularity. <a id="common" name="common"></a> 

<h4>Desire for Common Standards</h4>

The maturing digital library's approach to standards setting is
shaped by nascent aspirations for a more deeply networked future.
In brief, it becomes fashionable for digital libraries to lead
from the rear with respect to the standards and practices they
adopt, whether for their objects or their modular system
components. That is, maturing digital libraries prefer to claim
adherence to practices that are already vetted and endorsed by at
least one peer institution, rather than to make bold claims for
local innovations. This approach has become increasingly
apparent. DLF members have recently reached a consensus on a
diverse array of essential digital library tools. These tools
include the following: 

<ul>
<li>a model for negotiating access to commercial journals and
databases</li>

<li>minimum requirements for digitally reformatted book and
serial publications</li>

<li>minimum requirements of a digital archival repository for
electronic journals, and a data-encoding and transmission scheme
that will serve as a means for conveying information about the
structural, administrative, and technical characteristics of
digital objects<sup><a href="#n6">6</a></sup></li>
</ul>

The trend is readily apparent elsewhere, for example, in a
framework for evaluating digital collection development practices
advanced by a digital library forum convened by the Institute of
Museum and Library Services (IMLS 2001). 

<p>The sea change in attitude and approach is partly economic. As
part of the maturation process, digital libraries transform
interesting skunk-works projects into essential library
infrastructure. At this stage, failures can no longer be written
off as learning experiences gained at limited cost and subsidized
with external or soft money. Attitudinal shifts also reflect
changing understandings of digital collections and digital
library architectures. Where online collections are concerned,
maturing digital libraries recognize that they are unable, by
themselves, to supply end-users with what they really
want&mdash;enough online information to meet their specific and
evolving information needs. Consequently, they set a high premium
on interoperability and on definition and adoption of the
standards required to achieve it. The drift toward modular
systems architecture is also responsible for new attitudes that
favor adoption of more established standards, since systems
modules (locally and globally arrayed) must interoperate at a
fundamental level. Libraries at this stage demonstrate a desire
to pool their collective uncertainties and to define, and then
frame, a broad suite of practices as benchmarks in which they can
all invest and upon which they can more safely and predictably
build. Attempts to develop and codify digital library standards
and best practices are tapping into this very fruitful seam. <a
id="focus" name="focus"></a></p>

<h4>Focus on the User</h4>

The maturing digital library also seems to rediscover users.
Users do not figure much in the antecedent experimental phase.
Why should they? The library at that stage is experimenting with
new technologies&mdash;a purely internal affair&mdash;or looking
for additional means of giving users access to holdings catalogs,
reference materials, and some journals&mdash;areas where users'
needs are deemed to be well-known. As the integration of new
technologies begins to transform the library and the
possibilities for constructing innovative networked services,
libraries see a pressing need to engage users and to reassess
their interests and needs. By the late 1990s, there was already
evidence to suggest that the proliferation of Internet-based
information was fundamentally altering the expectations,
behaviors, and preferences of library users.<sup><a
href="#n7">7</a></sup> Accordingly, the maturing digital library
needs to know what users want from the networked library and what
role users perceive for the library in a constellation of
networked information and service providers. 

<p>Some of the library associations that take the lead in
quantifying traditional aspects of library use have been
relatively slow to respond to this new and pressing need. The
reasons for this are complicated. To begin with, the metrics are
complex and difficult to agree upon. How, for example, should we
define what constitutes a "use" of a networked information
object? Second, the library associations that are so well suited
to developing statistics for traditional library use are
typically membership organizations that are driven by consensus,
which, in this case, is difficult to engineer. Further, the
measures themselves can potentially disrupt the organization by
fundamentally altering the criteria by which it admits and
excludes new members. Debate about e-metrics is quickly
transformed into debate about what institutions should be
recognized as leading research libraries and is accordingly
difficult to resolve.</p>

<p>Some of the best analyses of user behavior and need take place
at the grassroots level in what can only be described as a series
of largely uncoordinated guerilla attacks that are mounted at the
institutional level and by ad hoc and informal associations.
Denise Troll Covey uncovered a wealth of these in a survey of
use-assessment methods at numerous digital libraries (Troll Covey
2002). Among the revelations emerging from these fragmented
efforts is the extent to which users want to work in highly
personalized and malleable online environments, that is,
environments that present them with the information and services
they actually need at any one time. The operational lessons for
the library are twofold: (1) users want seamless presentation of
collections and services, irrespective of where, by whom, or in
what format they are managed; and (2) libraries should consider
deploying user-profiling technologies that enable users to
configure a networked information environment that meets their
specific needs. Both lessons, if taken seriously and reflected in
new operational services, have revolutionary implications for the
library. The first would integrate the library into a globally
arrayed network of information services in a way that challenges
its historic organizational insularity. The second potentially
obscures from the user's view the library's importance as a
portal to that global network, because chunks of the library's
collections and services are removed from the library environment
and placed into new contexts.</p>

<p>The maturing digital library takes very seriously its users'
needs and interests through its support for a suite of activities
that have become known as "e-scholarship." Although the phrase
has a frustrating tendency to take on new meaning every time it
is used, its definition usually includes initiatives that enable
scholars to produce and disseminate "publications" with minimal
intervention from third-party commercial publishers. Overall
library interest in supporting innovative forms of scholarly
communication (or e-scholarship) at this point perhaps has less
to do with transforming scholarship than it does with a strategy
to increase pressure on publishers, who have increased prices
dramatically in the past 10 years, particularly in the
sciences.<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup> <a id="techint"
name="techint"></a></p>

<h3>Technical and Organizational Integration</h3>

The changing practices associated with the maturing digital
library have profound implications for how that library is
sustained technically and organizationally and for the manner in
which it is promoted. The quest for high-level modular
architectures has already been mentioned. It is arguably the most
common tendency that is evident among maturing digital library
programs. Interestingly, not all digital library programs turn
toward general technical solutions for the same reasons. At
Indiana and Michigan, general technical solutions are sought for
the economies they promise. Indiana, for example, is thinking
hard about how to afford the technical development work it
requires to integrate the diverse systems environments and data
content in use across its various projects. The problem had
little to do with local expertise, which is amply available in
seven full-time-equivalent staff members who contribute to the
DLP through the library and its partners. Rather, it has to do
with how&mdash;without completely disrupting the parallel
projects where their services are required&mdash;skilled staff
can be released to the tasks of specifying general technical
requirements and investigating potential solutions. Michigan, an
older program, reached the same roadblock before Indiana did and
for the same reasons. After several years of project work,
Michigan found itself re-engineering its online distribution
services each time it launched a new digital collection. By late
1999, Michigan's Digital Library Production Service had launched
a key project&mdash;to build an access system capable of
providing user access to the numerous and heterogeneous digital
objects that were being supplied through various digital
reformatting and other content development initiatives. The
fruits of that effort are available in its Digital Library
Extension Service (DLXS) system. By mid-2002, Michigan was
supplying support and software for that system to 27 digital
library efforts around the world. 

<p>Virginia's quest for general technical solutions is more a
response to users' needs than to economic forces. The media
centers at Virginia have adopted their own range of approaches to
the production, management, and distribution of the electronic
information for which they were responsible, and each has an
independent and highly distinctive online presence. The problem
is that, from a user's perspective, the fragmentation of digital
collections makes little sense. As Virginia thinks about
capitalizing on the mass of digital information it has created or
acquired through its media centers, it is beginning to envision
an online environment that allows patrons to search seamlessly
across collections, regardless of whether they were available in
print or digital form, and, if in digital form, regardless of
whether they were managed as texts, digital images, geospatial
information systems, or other types of data. Virginia's notion of
an online environment through which scholars can obtain
high-quality information&mdash;irrespective of how, where, by
whom, or in what format it is managed&mdash;required it to think
hard about building a technical infrastructure that could be
generalized and would be capable of supporting its heterogeneous
collections.<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The apparent importance to the maturing digital library of a
general core infrastructure is only amplified by investigation
into newer digital library programs. NYU's initial investments in
its digital library have been made with explicit reference to the
experiences of older programs whose project work stumbled
temporarily on a proliferation of diverse data objects and
delivery systems. Not wanting to repeat a development path that
was becoming well worn, NYU focused its earliest investment (as
did Harvard, Columbia, and one or two others) on the development
of core infrastructure, assuming that content and services could
eventually be built on top of that infrastructure.</p>

<p>The maturing digital library's quest for core technologies
seems to bolster rather than to undermine its emphasis on applied
research. Michigan, Virginia, Harvard, and CDL, for example, have
obtained or are seeking permanent, base-budget funding for the
research and development efforts that are focusing on the
identification of core technology. They recognize that such
research and development funding is essential to their programs'
successes, and that the programs cannot be sustained exclusively,
or even largely, on external funding and soft money. At Michigan,
investment flows into the development of DLXS.<sup><a
href="#n10">10</a></sup> At Virginia, it is reflected in the
Digital Library Research and Development Unit, established in
1999. At CDL, it is evident in the establishment of a small unit
under a director for education and strategic innovation. Harvard
is arguably the most interesting example. As a service to a
confederation of largely independent library organizations, the
Libraries Digital Initiative (LDI) did not launch as a series of
independent projects. It began instead by building a common
digital library infrastructure that would support Harvard
libraries in their development and exploitation of digital
collections. As it reaches the end of its first four years (and
the end of the $12-million, one-time funding that launched the
program in 1998), the LDI has developed first-generation
infrastructure. In its second phase, it will seek a means of
ensuring that the infrastructure will be developed and maintained
out of whatever base-budget funding is available to the
program.</p>

<p>The digital library's organizational integration into
mainstream library services is another aspect of its maturation.
In its startup phase, the program may be relatively unknown to
library staff. Interviewees at more than one institution noted
how the programs in their earliest phases were better known
nationally than on campus or even within their host libraries. As
digital library collections and services develop, their impacts
are increasingly felt on local library staff. Reference staff
find themselves fielding queries about digital library
collections; catalogers consider descriptions for digital objects
where once they focused exclusively on bibliographic materials;
conservation officers find their work flow and priorities shaped
to some extent by the progress of local digital reformatting
activities.</p>

<p>The impacts do not flow in one direction only. Library staff
members who are responsible for the development of print
collections assert their perspective in setting priorities for
digital collection development decisions. Bibliographic
cataloging practices are considered as the library develops
systems that allow users to search across collections,
irrespective of their format and location. The hardware, network
protocol, and systems choices that technical services make have
implications for platform choices in the digital library. If the
maturing digital library program emerges out of the skunk works
and into the mainstream of library services, it does so in part
because the program's work at some stage can neither be safely
ignored by nor conducted in isolation from other library
services. Rationalization is encouraged by the library's
relatively inelastic personnel budget. Simply put, digital
library programs are able to develop collections and services
beyond their experimental phase only by organizing themselves so
they may achieve an appropriate functional division of labor. At
the very point when a digital library program is ready to hire
its second (possibly even its first) metadata librarian, for
example, it may also be ready to think seriously about
establishing a stronger liaison with the cataloging
department.</p>

<p>Rationalization is most evident at institutions such as
Michigan and Virginia, which have older digital library programs.
At Michigan, the program that reported directly to its three
founding partners from the library, the School of Information,
and the campus computing service was incorporated into the
library, and the program's executive director was appointed as an
associate director with responsibilities for IT services and
electronic collections. This initial reorganization may have had
more to do with changes in the personnel and priorities of the
university's senior management than it did with any intrinsic
need to rationalize digital library programs.</p>

<p>Still, once implemented, this structure created opportunities
for&mdash;and even required&mdash;further organizational
adjustments. Once the program was embedded within the library
line, senior library management took pains to smooth its
operation with existing library services. New money allocated to
the library by a friendly university administration helped
considerably in firming up infrastructure support and providing
continuing funds for new program development. The library also
introduced a committee structure that maximized opportunities for
cross-fertilization among library managers in traditional and
nontraditional units. By placing the Digital Library Services
Division under the associate director, the digital library
obtained representation on the library's senior management
group&mdash;its executive council. From that perch it
participated in thinking strategically and operationally about a
broad array of library functions that interrelate with digital
content, systems, and infrastructure. At the same time, managers
responsible for those traditional functions helped think about
and shape the digital library's future. As the program evolved,
additional departments (the Scholarly Publishing Office, for
example) were added as peer units to the existing operational
one&mdash;the Digital Library Production Service.</p>

<p>Virginia's experience of reorganization is not altogether
different, though it was not quite as fundamental. Virginia's
program, unlike that of Michigan, was always represented in the
library's senior management group through the deputy university
librarian. One consequence is that the library's senior
management had early opportunities to encourage the
cross-fertilization of library staff in new and existing units.
From an early date, the Electronic Text Center provided basic
HTML instruction to library staff&mdash;offerings that were as
popular as they were effective in giving those staff members
insight into the opportunities, as well as the pitfalls, inherent
in the online environment. Virginia's staff-share program was
also effective in developing mutual understanding across library
units and in supporting two-way transfers of professional skills.
Structural reorganization, which came later, focused primarily on
aligning effort at Virginia's media centers and on developing
common services, such as digitization facilities and research and
development units that they can share.</p>

<p>The DLF survey showed some evidence that consolidation of
digital library activities is beginning to take place generally,
at least with respect to the development of digital collections.
For example, digital library staff members have a limited role in
acquiring access to commercial electronic information. At 95
percent of the libraries responding to the DLF survey, that
responsibility was vested in the subject bibliographers and other
professional staff who were responsible for acquiring print
materials. With respect to selecting materials from library
holdings for digital reformatting, three-quarters of the survey
respondents said that such responsibility was located largely, if
not exclusively, in digital library departments and initiatives.
Surprisingly, however, in half of those institutions,
responsibility was shared with subject bibliographers&mdash;that
is, with staff in traditional library services.</p>

<p>Reorganization of the maturing digital library has a number of
practical implications. As staff members from outside the
original skunk works become more involved in developing or
supporting the use of digital library collections, the program is
at pains to document its practices in various process
recommendations, including, for example, guidelines for standards
implementation, flow control, and rights clearance. Indeed, the
extent of this gray literature provides some measure of a
program's maturity. In the skunk works, processes and practices
are in flux, and few are responsible for developing and
implementing them. As the digital library matures, its
collections and services rely much more on professional staff who
are distributed across the library and who will require access to
such reference materials. Again, the influences flow in two
directions. While the maturing digital library typically takes
responsibility for practical and process guidelines, the
library's senior management, assisted by staff from across the
library, supplies the policy framework in which the program's
practices are applied. Early in the adolescent stage, for
example, collection policies are revised so they can govern the
selection of commercial electronic resources as well as
bibliographic materials. Later developments include preservation
policies that take account of digital as well as bibliographic
materials and policies that articulate the library's orientation
toward intellectual property and the exercise of the fair-use
exclusion with both digital and print materials. Regardless of
whether the documentation guides or reflects evolving practices,
it is significant. Its very existence recognizes initial thinking
about how digital library activities fit into and help fulfill
the library's overall collection and service goals. For this
reason, it is an important milestone of the maturing digital
library.<sup><a href="#n11">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Institutions are differently positioned to effect the
reorganization that is required to integrate digital initiatives
into the fabric of the library. Staff development is a
significant issue. However well suited professional librarians
are to developing and maintaining high-quality digital libraries,
they apply their skills differently in digital and traditional
environments. Mastering different techniques requires training
opportunities that all institutions are not equally positioned to
supply. In addition, reorganization may require libraries to
think anew about how, by whom, and in what combinations certain
tasks are done. Here, too, there are numerous and substantial
differences between institutions. Some lack the nimbleness and
facility that is needed to effect such changes, which, at a
fundamental level, will determine whether and at what pace a
digital library program will mature. <a id="market"
name="market"></a></p>

<h3>Marketing and Promotion</h3>

As a digital library grows, there are subtle shifts in the way it
is promoted and presented to the world. Marketing is not unknown
to startup programs. Although the target audience is confined to
key decision makers on campus (both inside and outside the
library) and potential external funders, the marketing challenges
in the early phase are important. At the University of
California, it took years of committee work and a few well-placed
champions to sell the CDL to key decision makers on the nine UC
campuses and to the Office of the President. The case for
Harvard's LDI was similarly made through committee work, although
over a much shorter period of time. Michigan relied on a yearlong
symposium. 

<p>As digital library programs mature, they gain visibility
through their online presence, their success in acquiring
external funding, or their ability to attract regional, national,
or even international acclaim. They rely as much as ever on
effective promotions to senior managers and to external funders.
They also find themselves having to appeal to new audiences: to
their faculty and other patrons and to other library staff whose
own work, as we have seen, is influenced by and contributes to
the digital library. Faculty members have a substantial stake
because the campus library supports their research and teaching.
They also have very different needs with respect to library
collections and services&mdash;needs that turn on discipline,
age, and personal preference. Without exception, the programs
where interviews were conducted took pains to promote themselves
to the faculty. This was true even of Harvard's LDI, which serves
the faculties through the libraries.</p>

<p>At the institutions where interviews were conducted,
promotional activities had three things in common. First, the
programs took pains to demonstrate that digital libraries could
be supported in a way that did not threaten funding for
traditional library services, in particular for the development
of print collections. It is unclear whether this is a realistic
assessment of future funding models or merely an anticipation of
future battles for the digital library.</p>

<p>Second, the programs capitalized wherever possible on
successful services&mdash;that is, services that were well
received by patrons, and by faculty patrons in particular. Senior
managers at CDL, Harvard's LDI, Indiana, and Virginia were well
aware of how much support for their programs is built on early
successes, even those successes that owed little or nothing to
the digital library program. CDL claims Melvyl (UC's union
catalog) as a birthright, even though it was developed by the
Department of Library Automation some years before the CDL's
founding. CDL's continued maintenance and enhancement of Melvyl
(e.g., with electronic "request" services) helps garner the
public support it needs to run more experimental initiatives such
as those associated with its e-scholarship program.</p>

<p>The credibility that Harvard's LDI requires to develop
operational services that do not see the light of day for several
years grows out of its host unit's successful and timely delivery
of core services such as Hollis (the university libraries' shared
catalog). Indiana's DLP builds on the visible successes of LETRS,
the audio e-reserves VARIATIONS, and IUCAT, its union catalog.
Virginia wrapped its first digital library forays in the cloak of
earlier successes, notably with VIRGO, the library's online
catalog, and with course tools, the instructional technologies
that the library supports in tandem with the university's
computing service. In addition, the programs take pains to
promote new successes as they become available. In its first
several years, CDL as a matter of policy launched a new service
or a service upgrade every six months with appropriate
system-wide publicity. Virginia's Electronic Text Center
vigorously promotes the success it has had delivering its online
texts as e-books. Michigan promotes an array of digital
initiatives for users, such as geographic information systems
(GIS), numeric data, humanities texts, and visual resources that
have grown out of research projects.</p>

<p>Early digital library experience at NYU provides an
interesting counter-example of the importance of service
successes in garnering support for programs that might otherwise
be perceived as experimental, or even peripheral, to core library
activities. At NYU, in an early digital library initiative
supported by foundation funding, the library attempted to place
records for full-text electronic resources into the OPAC catalog
environment. The initiative encountered several insurmountable
obstacles. The host library was inappropriately organized to
support an initiative that had both research and operational
service components. It also lacked the needed technical
expertise. Perhaps the largest hurdle had to do with the poor
understanding of metadata that existed at that time. The project
concluded, but it was never deemed to be successful by library
staff and others who were involved in building and supporting use
of the campus's scholarly information environment. This negative
experience hampered the digital library program when it was begun
again in earnest, and on a far more ambitious and comprehensive
footing, years later. Professional staff had to be convinced that
not all digital library initiatives were so speculative and so
unfruitful.</p>

<p>A third common thread exists in the way that digital library
programs promote themselves on campus. Interestingly, they
portray themselves as fostering innovation while helping the
library fulfill traditional roles. At Harvard, for example, the
LDI presents itself both as a means of enhancing the university
libraries' abilities to acquire, manage, and encourage scholarly
exploitation of the digital scholarly and cultural record and as
a mechanism for integrating digital and nondigital holdings. The
innovative aspect of the LDI grows directly out of its
traditional function, i.e., through the development of new
collection management techniques, some of which allow faculty to
search for the first time across Harvard libraries' disparate
collections. Michigan's digital library program is also promoted
as a means of developing and extending traditional collections,
notably through digitization and robust access mechanisms that
complement traditional bibliographic systems. Where Harvard finds
innovation in integrated searches that the LDI permits, Michigan
finds it in the enhanced functionality that scholars and students
find in monograph and serial collections that can be explored as
databases. Michigan's digital library program, especially its
digital reformatting of monographs and serials, is a vital
component of its traditional preservation program. It has
recently moved its preservation-reformatting program from paper
to digital as the default strategy for preserving brittle
materials. NYU's embryonic digital library program, meanwhile, is
oriented around the university's strong interdisciplinary
interest in aspects of the performing arts and its location in
New York City, capital of the performing arts. Virginia promotes
its program's support for the library's historic service
orientation toward students and faculty. Through the media
centers, Virginia's digital library program helps faculty members
in their research and teaching. It also supports faculty
innovation in the classroom and in scholarly publishing. <a

<h2>From Integration to Interdependency: The Adult Digital
Library</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/hr.gif" width="500" height="24" border="0"
align="top" alt="rule" /></p>

The digital library is an organizational form that is in flux. It
is much too soon to describe the adult program with anything more
certain than references to common trends and the challenges they
reflect. It is not yet possible to identify any single program
that could comfortably describe itself at as fully grown or
mature. <a id="infra" name="infra"></a> 

<h3>Digital Libraries as Infrastructure</h3>

It is becoming apparent that the adult digital library program
will no longer be organizationally or functionally distinct from
the library as whole. When digital libraries mature, we will talk
about libraries in a manner that assumes electronic information,
computer technologies, and networked collections and services are
as much a part of the infrastructure as book stacks and catalogs
were for the traditional library. It is interesting to speculate
whether digital library programs will preserve their distinctive
organizational status in anywhere other than in confederal
initiatives such as those at UC and Harvard. <a id="move"
name="move"></a>
<h3>Move Toward Permanent Funding</h3>

Many believe that as the digital library becomes library
infrastructure, the financial resources needed to maintain it
will come from numerous budget lines rather than from one line
that is earmarked for digitization. In the adult digital library,
electronic resources will be acquired from general collection
budgets, and digital preservation activities will be supported
with general preservation funds. This integration makes sense at
a number of levels. If a research library is concerned with
collecting, maintaining, and ensuring access to cultural and
scholarly information, then it will set priorities for
collection, preservation, and access that take into consideration
all the differently formatted information that comes under its
purview. These integrating tendencies are becoming apparent. The
survey responses demonstrated how important core funding is to
the digital library. Seventy-one percent of the surveyed
institutions noted that their digital library programs depended
on some measure of core funding that is reallocated from other
budget lines. The same number said that external funding was
important, while about 51 percent noted the importance of new
money. Everything learned through the interviews suggests this
trend is likely to continue. Thus, it is possible that an adult
digital library will be characterized in part by its overwhelming
reliance on core funding. In addition, there is evidence of
digital library activities being supported with funds not
earmarked for the digital library per se. UC libraries, for
example, are funding a digital archival repository with the same
funds used to support preservation microfilming, and, as already
indicated, Michigan has made digital reformatting a fundamental
part of its book preservation program. Other institutions are
changing their collection-development practices in a way that
suggests that digital and nondigital materials will soon be
funded with general collection development money. <a id="contin"

<h3>Continued Experimentation</h3>

Perpetual experimentation may also be a characteristic of the
adult digital library. Interestingly, maturing digital libraries
place more emphasis on research and development than do the most
experimental startup facilities. We have already noted this
emphasis at Harvard, Virginia, and CDL. It is also apparent in
data gathered from the survey questionnaire. Those data
demonstrate that, on average, DLF member libraries have access to
2.3 full-time employees who are devoted to research and
development work. In 2000, DLF member libraries on average spent
10 percent of their digital library budgets (more than $425,000)
on research and development. This figure increases to 16 percent
if the subscription and acquisition costs for commercial content
(which average about $1,700,000 per institution) are not included
as part of the digital library budget. The persistent research
orientation was emphasized repeatedly in the interviews. David
Seaman stressed how the University of Virginia's digital library
program was constantly reinventing itself in a "virtuous" cycle
that plowed evolving skills and capacities into the development
of new collections or services and the growth around them of new
library applications and user communities. Elsewhere, it became
evident that digital libraries that had focused their efforts in
one area&mdash;access systems and digitization at Michigan, the
development of core infrastructure at Harvard&mdash;require
permanent research and development effort to help them play
catch-up in others as they develop elsewhere (e-scholarship at
Michigan, digitization at Harvard). <a id="deep" name="deep"></a>


<h3>Deep Interdependency</h3>

Deep interdependency with off- and on-campus information
organizations also characterizes mature digital libraries in an
academic setting. <a id="off" name="off"></a>
<h4>Off-Campus</h4>

The assumption that libraries will become more interdependent
with information organizations off-campus is predicated on the
logic of the network's development. Historically, the academic
library brought together the information, people, and services
necessary to organize, preserve, manage access to, and support
the pedagogical and research use of scholarly and cultural
information.<sup><a href="#n12">12</a></sup> The rapid penetration
of network technology undermined the academic library's
underpinnings&mdash;the foundation of its physical, cultural,
organizational, financial, and professional form. In a networked
world, where access to information no longer requires proximity
to the physical medium on which it is carried (e.g., printed
paper, film), it no longer makes sense for academic libraries to
develop research and teaching collections. This is not a question
of whether libraries should preserve newspapers and other
non-unique cultural artifacts&mdash;of course, they should. It is
about whether it is economical, or even sensible, for every
library to own, manage, and preserve those artifacts. Indeed, if
one were to jettison our cultural and professional baggage and
start to conceptualize how to manage and secure access to
society's information outputs in all formats, we might imagine a
close network of information services sustained in part by
free-market principles of supply and demand and in part by the
philanthropic subsidies supplied by universities, libraries, and
organizations that maintain access to our heritage. As an
example, take the large legacy of non-unique print materials. In
an extensively networked environment, one can access the
information (on screen, on paper, and in other ways) that is
carried by these materials without accessing the materials
themselves.<sup><a href="#n13">13</a></sup> Does it therefore not
make sense to minimize the redundant management of the physical
materials and to rely more heavily on electronic access? In a
rational economic system, one might at a minimum envision the
following: 

<ul>
<li>service points (academic libraries) managing access (online,
print-on-demand, and other means)</li>

<li>digital repositories (managing electronic corpora and
ensuring they are available for different service points)</li>

<li>print repositories that preserve the physical artifacts and
make them available to scholars whose research requires that they
handle the objects</li>
</ul>

One may also imagine a range of services essential to the
operation of repositories and service points&mdash;services that
include registries (or union catalogs) that record information
about repository holdings (print and digital) and name-resolution
services (assisting in the persistent identification of
peripatetic digital files and physical artifacts). In this
scenario, many academic libraries are able to relinquish
functions having to do with the management of physical and
digital materials without impinging on the collections and
services they offer to their patrons. In fact, the collections
and services they offer are greatly improved and extended as the
library takes its place as part of a networked constellation of
interdependent information collections and services. 

<p>The model is not so fantastic. Indeed, it is already beginning
to emerge. JSTOR acts as a distribution agent responsible for
ensuring online access to many scholarly journals. It is also an
archival repository that ensures that these journals persist in
their digital form. As libraries develop trust in JSTOR as both a
distribution point and a digital archival repository, and as
library patrons get used to accessing scholarly journal content
in electronic form, libraries are beginning to remove from their
shelves copies of the print journals upon which the JSTOR
collection is based. "Deaccessioning" print volumes makes
economic sense and allows the library to redirect scarce
resources once tied up in the management of JSTOR
journals&mdash;resources that paid for shelving space, print
preservation, circulation, and reshelving work, for example
(Lawrence, Connaway, and Brighman 2001). The scenario evolving
around JSTOR is missing only one ingredient&mdash;a small number
of print repositories that ensure persistence of the printed
journals that make up the JSTOR collection. Still, one hopes and
suspects that it is only a matter of time before at least a few
such repositories emerge on national and regional bases.<sup><a
href="#n14">14</a></sup></p>

<p>The model that relies upon distributed provision of
interlocking service functions works as well&mdash;or better,
given the volume of information&mdash;for materials that are born
digital (i.e., those that exist from the outset in a digital
form, whether as databases, geospatial information, images,
sound, video files, or mixed media applications). The model is
being tried in the delivery of library reference services, but it
is too soon to assess the result (McClure and Lankes 2001). There
is evidence that the model's development need not be impeded by
legal and business considerations such as those that may surround
the distribution of copyrighted material. The experience of JSTOR
and other services, such as the Art Museum Image Consortium
(AMICO) and HighWire Press, suggests that there are models that
satisfy those who hold intellectual property rights or copyright
to information as well as those who have an interest in using
that information for research and teaching.</p>

<p>One might argue that the library itself is the single greatest
obstacle to a more distributed and economically rational
provision of information services. It is difficult to cede to
third parties responsibility for collections and services that
have historically been provided in-house and upon which library
patrons rely so heavily. It is especially difficult when those
who are forced to consider such fundamental reorganization are
encumbered with professional, cultural, and organizational
baggage that defines a high-quality library as one that supports
in a single place a very wide range of collections and
services&mdash;a range so wide that it may now be beyond the
reach of any single library. <a id="on" name="on"></a></p>

<h4>On-Campus</h4>

Assumptions about adult digital libraries becoming more
interdependent with information organizations on campus are also
predicated upon the dynamic logic of the network's development
and use. As the academic library develops into a service
organization that supports access to scholarly information in all
formats, to users both on- and off-campus, it requires a highly
sophisticated technical infrastructure. Although circumstances
vary across campuses, the library nowhere manages the sum total
of that infrastructure, and it will never do so. Libraries rely
on local campus networks that they do not build or manage. In
many institutions, they provide access to electronic research and
teaching resources but rely on campus units outside the library
(e.g., academic computing services, instructional technology
divisions, audiovisual departments) to support faculty and
students in their use of these materials. 

<p>The fragmented organizational approach to information
provision that exists on most large campuses harkens back to a
prenetworked world when discrete information service functions
were built on and delivered through distinctive technical
platforms. In the early 1970s, campus telecommunications,
mainframe computing, audiovisual departments, and libraries
delivered discrete information services using very different
technologies. In 2002, these discrete functions have migrated
into a networked space where they are vastly more difficult to
distinguish from one another, in part because they rely upon the
same infrastructure. Convergence is evident to some extent in the
DLF survey data: 55 percent of the libraries responding noted
some formal relation with their IT or academic computing service.
Ninety percent claimed either a formal or an informal
relationship. Only two respondents (11 percent) indicated they
had no relationship, formal or informal, with any other
information organization on campus. Convergence has also fostered
competition as information organizations assert their claims
against that portion of the university's resources that can be
devoted to information management generally. <a id="within"
name="within"></a></p>

<h3>Competition Within the University</h3>

<a id="arch" name="arch"></a> 

<h4>Archiving University Information</h4>

Interdepartmental competition can impede provision of a new
service where no single organization is able to assert a
legitimate claim to that service. The best example may be the
lack of coordination in the provision of digital archival
repositories on campuses. Like corporate entities, universities
produce an increasing amount of digital information, much of
which has significant long-term value. That value, however, can
be realized only if records are maintained. Databases of student
records are a foundation upon which future fund-raising efforts
may be built. Their value can be measured in financial terms. The
value of other records is measured differently. Electronic
financial and administrative records, most of which have no print
equivalent, need to be kept for accountability. Data produced as
a by-product of research are a crucial part of the scientific
record.<sup><a href="#n15">15</a></sup> Online course materials
and a rapidly growing gray literature of pre-prints, working
papers, and research data to which faculty and student Web sites
contribute are an important part of the pedagogical and scholarly
record. Together, these information resources constitute
invaluable university assets that are at risk of loss because it
remains difficult to locate responsibility and capacity for their
long-term maintenance in any one department or in a departmental
collaboration. 

<p>The DLF survey documents not only the problem's complexity but
also some interesting opportunities for addressing it. Excluding
administrative and financial data from its purview, the survey
sought to determine where libraries perceived the loci of
responsibility for the production, distribution, and maintenance
of electronic information produced on campus resulting from or
supporting research and teaching. Responses demonstrated that the
production and distribution of online research and teaching
materials was taking place outside the library&mdash;in academic
departments and the units responsible for providing academic
staff with technical support.<sup><a href="#n16">16</a></sup></p>

<p>At the same time, libraries perceived themselves as one of the
few units on campus with an interest in preserving these
materials. Therefore, the library may be positioned to stake a
credible claim to some custodial role with respect the campus's
digital information assets. The library may fulfill this role in
cooperation with other units that have better capacity for
providing some of the technological functions associated with
large-scale data management and preservation. Some progress is
clearly being made. The survey demonstrates that 4.8 percent of
the DLF member libraries have developed or contributed to digital
preservation policies that include electronic information created
on campus but outside the library. At the same time, of four DLF
member libraries that are developing digital repositories, only
one is doing so in collaboration with other campus-based
information organizations. <a id="insttech"
name="insttech"></a></p>

<h4>Instructional Technologies</h4>

Competition among campus information organizations has other
effects that may impede the library in fulfilling important
roles. Such effects are overwhelmingly apparent where the
development and use of instructional technologies are concerned.
In virtually every DLF member institution, responsibility for
instructional technologies is located outside the library.
Organizational location need not be a problem; in this case,
however, it has resulted in the near-universal deployment of
instructional technologies that do not integrate with the digital
library. In many cases, instructional technologies or course
management systems and digital libraries are being developed
independently of one another. Because of the distributed
structure of IT on most campuses, this practice appears to be as
true on campuses with well-developed digital library programs as
it is on those where such programs are just getting under way. 

<p>The waste is excessive, even in good economic times.
Bibliographic references that may be included with online course
materials are not automatically hot-linked to the library's
online catalog; in some instances, they cannot be linked. The
digitally reformatted materials produced by the library, and the
many more such materials produced at other libraries, museums,
and archives, and to which most libraries now link through
various means, are placed outside the pedagogical purview as it
is defined online by instructional technologies. The digital
library as a learning resource is therefore put at risk.
Meanwhile, faculty and students work in isolation from a wealth
of well-organized, high-quality information that is directly
relevant to their learning and for which they have already paid,
for example, through university and library spending. <a

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/hr.gif" width="500" height="24" border="0"
align="top" alt="rule" /></p>

At research universities, the birth and early growth of digital
libraries took place in the 1990s, the time when information
technology units and faculties on large campuses were
investigating the potential of networked technology for research
and administrative support. Each of these libraries has migrated
its bibliographic catalogs online and most are turning
aggressively to the construction of online finding aids that
support discovery and use of archival materials, recorded sound,
prints and photographs, and other special and non-bibliographic
collections.<sup><a href="#n17">17</a></sup> Research libraries
are also aggressively building online journal and reference
literature as it becomes digital.<sup><a href="#n18">18</a></sup>
Most digital libraries have evolved from nimble and often
externally funded projects that are located somewhere just
outside the regular "line" into maturing programs that are
becoming fundamental and integral parts of the library. Digital
library programs seem to take on different complexions that
reflect their host organizations' mission, leadership, available
funding, and specific collection and service strengths. Although
no program is monolithic in its orientation, certain emphases are
readily identifiable in maturing programs. 

<p>Some emphasize the digital library as a collection development
arm. CDL, Cornell, Harvard, NYU, and Stanford, for example, are
exploring means of archiving selectively those scholarly
materials that are uniquely available in electronic form.
Michigan, Cornell, and Yale are using or have used digital
library techniques to develop and manage fragile printed
materials. There, digital surrogates are created for fragile
books and used to develop print and online access copies to save
wear and tear on the originals.</p>

<p>Some libraries are beginning to realize how digital
technologies might help reduce the costly and redundant
management of print materials held by numbers of research
libraries. Where libraries can reliably deliver access to online
editions of scholarly journals (editions that evidence suggests
faculty and students prefer anyway [Dagar, Greenstein, and Watson
Healy 2001]), they are beginning to be able to reduce redundant
print copies while ensuring that at least some print editions are
made persistently available.<sup><a href="#n19">19</a></sup> Nine
campuses of the UC are canceling redundant print editions of
selected journal titles while ensuring that sufficient print
copies remain in selected campus libraries or shared storage
facilities. The 11 Midwest university libraries in the Committee
on Institutional Cooperation are beginning to use the Center for
Research Libraries in Chicago as an archive for the print
journals included in JSTOR. Similar approaches are being explored
for other materials.</p>

<p>Some digital library programs emphasize services over
collection. But almost half of the DLF members digitize selected
rare, special, and other collections as a means of encouraging
access to and use of those collections by scholars, students, and
a broader public. Library digitization programs were driven
initially by curatorial interests. They targeted unique special
collections that research libraries owned. Today, an expanding
dialog between libraries and scholars is allowing libraries to
consider what online resources humanities scholars need. In the
humanities, scholars investigate meaningful bodies of information
and build ideas and conclusions from a context. Therefore, which
collections are digitized will make a difference in how quickly
online scholarship will grow. Research using digital resources is
beginning to have an impact in the humanities, although it has
not replaced the traditional critical mass of books and archives
that scholars investigate. Research projects such as the Valley
of the Shadow and Perseus are moving disciplines into uncharted
and exciting online research territory, and some online journals
now link to digital repositories.</p>

<p>Conversion of analog materials to digital is often confused as
representing the sum total of what digital libraries do. Clearly,
it is not. Experimentation in new forms of scholarly publishing,
notably at Virginia, but now increasingly elsewhere, is another
kind of service orientation. So is the provision to students of
online class resources, such as sound recordings and art history
images at Indiana. Other variations can be seen at Carnegie
Mellon University, North Carolina State University, and the
University of Illinois, where digital library programs explore in
depth how users behave in online environments with a view to
improving those environments.</p>

<p>The digital library pioneers who led their organizations at an
exciting and exploratory time created diverse programs, but with
synergies that hold promise through the application of network
technologies. It is obvious that network technologies permit
users to access information regardless of where information is
located, but there are still significant obstacles to deep
resource sharing, including the effect that competition among
universities has on library cooperation. In addition, the
question of whether and to what extent the networked activities
of research libraries will affect or inform public libraries, or
even those academic libraries that are more oriented toward
teaching, remains unanswered.</p>

<p>Historically, libraries fulfilled diverse functions by
acquiring and assembling collections, services, and professional
staff in a single place. Access to the library and its
professionals required proximity to them. The rapid development
of network technologies has not eradicated the significance of
the library as place and as owner of collections, but it has
diminished and will continue to diminish it. Network technologies
are forcing a fundamental transformation of the library and the
university itself. Against this background, the record of
accomplishment recorded in these pages is extraordinary.</p>

<p>In the research library, achievements occurred precisely
because these libraries were located in large and complicated
environments. First, they existed within the framework of
research and development that occurs on large campuses and were,
in some instances, able to harness that expertise to their
advantage through collaboration. Second, with significant budget,
staff, and space, they were able to move discreetly some
resources from traditional library activities into digital
research and development. To do this, they needed to have a
strong vision of the future that enabled them to push a largely
process-driven environment into a research and development
arena&mdash; something that was mostly unknown in the research
library in the late twentieth century. This is why so many young
programs relied on skunk works or laboratories where library
staff worked away from daily operations.</p>

<p>In the traditional environment, the size of the academic
library's collection was the single biggest determinant of its
national and international status. How the collection was used
and how often it was used were matters of smaller concern. In a
networked environment, the reverse is true. Print collection size
and scope continue to be important in the research library
community, but as rich local holdings are supplemented by the
ever-broadening array of networked information that includes
digital collections, the importance of the physical collection's
size is diminishing in favor of instant desktop access. In some
disciplines, books from the library's stacks are still used
heavily and will continue to be used, but in other disciplines
networked resources are eclipsing print.</p>

<p>Because large research libraries are developing and presenting
information online, they are grappling with how to present
networked information&mdash;its look, feel, functionality, and
context&mdash;and taking on new interpretive and publishing
roles. For the first time in decades, research libraries are
thinking hard about how to develop and support use of their
scholarly and teaching resources. Not surprisingly, the expertise
required to plan and create online collections and services that
bring together resources for teaching and scholarship is rarely
found completely within the library. It occurs instead through
the combined thinking of scholars, information professionals, and
technologists. The quest might have the beneficial result of
integrating the library into the academic community after decades
of it being a stand-alone resource. In some cases, the survey and
case study data suggest that this trend is already occurring.</p>

<p>The coordinated provision of networked information services is
probably the biggest challenge that libraries, along with
everyone else in the academy, face today. In fact, the
"stovepipe" organization that is common within universities and
the tradition of faculty working as individual entrepreneurs are
both significant barriers to the inclusion of the library in
enterprise-wide planning. The current rush by faculty to create
online learning environments is a good example. Without a
campus-based technology approach and collaboration with the
library to include digital resources already available, course
management systems are doomed to be redundant and limited
endeavors at a time when budgets are already stretched too thin.
In an environment that has long valued individual, department, or
school achievements and that mostly markets itself in bits and
pieces to its various constituent groups, the notion of a more
coordinated approach to the provision of networked information
services, e.g., the digital library, course management tools, or
preservation of the university's digital assets, is one that is
strange to many in the academy. (More than four years ago, Brian
Hawkins and Pat Battin [1998] explored the critical
interrelationship between the library and the higher education
enterprise as well as the need to transform the academy's
traditional organization in order to use technology
effectively.)</p>

<p>Early digital projects initiated within the research library
have now grown into programs. Programs that began in separate
organizational units within the library are moving into the
fabric of everything the research library does. As research
libraries develop new digital collections and access tools, new
physical spaces where scholars, information professionals, and
technologists can work together on digital challenges, and new
ways to assist scholars in their work (e.g., helping to preserve
and access research in digital repositories or assisting scholars
to publish with minimal intervention from commercial publishers),
the next challenges will include the ability of the research
library to embed itself ever more deeply in the scholarly
environment and in the transformational change that will occur in
the academy at some point from the pervasive use of information
technology.</p>

electronic scholarly journals that attempt to compete with
expensive and traditional commercial e-journals&mdash;a business

the only means by which Michigan supports what it sees as

its technical development funds and offsetting some of its
development costs.</p>

<p><a id="n12" name="n12">12</a> Colleges and other institutes of
higher education that emphasize teaching over research also
developed academic libraries to physically assemble and collocate
information, individuals, and services. Their collection and
service purview, however, is more defined by local pedagogical
requirements than is that of the research library.</p>

<p><a id="n13" name="n13">13</a> This does not suggest that,
henceforth, printed books should be read only "on screen" or on
some hand-held device. Rather, we should begin to think more
creatively about delivering electronic information through a
variety of means, including, for example, localized
print-on-demand services.</p>

<p><a id="n14" name="n14">14</a> The Center for Research Libraries
is attempting to acquire a complete file of the print copies of
journals available through JSTOR. See <a
href="http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/info/jstor/crljstor.htm"
target="_new">http://wwwcrl.uchicago.edu/info/jstor/crljstor.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a id="n15" name="n15">15</a> This is evident in the heavy use
that scholars make of the few archives that have been established
to collect and manage these data, for example, the
Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>

<p><a id="n16" name="n16">16</a> The library's role in producing
and distributing electronic information was focused almost
entirely on digitally reformatted materials drawn from library
holdings. Although the library developed the materials in support
of research and teaching, they were frequently not developed in
consultation with scholars involved in those research and
teaching activities.</p>

<p><a id="n17" name="n17">17</a> Costs for cataloging collections
and making the catalogs accessible online are probably a
library's greatest cumulative expenditure. Although bibliographic
information for print and electronic holdings is now regularly
funneled into the online catalog, much remains to be accomplished
in special and archival collections, prints and photographs,
microforms, slide libraries, sound recordings, maps, and the
numerous other special collections that research libraries own
and manage. The task is much larger if extended to Internet
resources.</p>

<p><a id="n18" name="n18">18</a> At this point, the amount of money
spent annually by DLF members on subscriptions to commercial
electronic information dwarfs all other digital expenditures.
