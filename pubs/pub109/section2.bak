<p>The University of California (UC) Board of Regents and
President Richard Atkinson founded the California Digital Library
(CDL) in 1997. Calling the CDL a "library without walls,"
Atkinson charged it with selecting, building, managing, and
preserving the university's shared collections of digital
resources and with applying new technologies to increase use of
the university's physical collections across all UC campuses and
the state at large. CDL's vision encompasses four strategies:
building, sharing, and preserving digital collections; creating
tools and services; influencing and supporting innovation in
scholarly communication; and fostering strategic partnerships for
digital library development. Located in the Office of the
President in Oakland, CDL operates with about 45 full-time staff
members within the office's complement of 1,500 staff
members.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

The California Digital Library emerged from a series of
discussions, begun in 1991, on enhancing Melvyl, a union catalog
of UC and other California libraries. Clifford Lynch, then head
of the Division of Library Automation for the UC system,
presented a draft plan for the future of the online catalog for
discussion by UC librarians from all campuses at their regular
meetings. The librarians considered the plan and recommended that
it be broadened to address what the UC libraries could do
together to create a digital environment that they could not
build separately. Richard Lucier, who was then the university
librarian at UC San Francisco, obtained release time to rewrite
the document in consultation with a Digital Library Executive
Working Group. Concurrently, the campus chancellors were becoming
concerned about the rising cost of the UC libraries and the
potential impact of digital technology. UC was in the midst of a
budget crunch of significant magnitude at this time. 

<p>The result was agreement by the chancellors and the president
to create the Library Planning and Action Initiative (LPAI).
Lucier was appointed to head this 18-month effort, which was
guided by an advisory committee of provosts, faculty,
administrators, and librarians. The report of the LPAI (1998) and
subsequent regents' budgets embodying the report's
recommendations identified seven strategies to help guide the UC
libraries through a transition from a campus-based and
print-centered service model to one that blends print and digital
information and more effectively leverages the shared resources
and capabilities of the UC system. The three principal strategies
were to (a) sustain adequate campus print collections, (b) expand
the sharing of collections among the UC libraries, and (c)
establish the California Digital Library as a shared digital
collection and digital library environment for the UC system.
After a national search, Lucier was named the founding university
librarian for system-wide scholarly information and executive
director of the CDL, which emerged as a "co-library" of the
University of California system.</p>

<p>Because CDL was born during a fiscal crisis, the plan that the
advisory committee developed bound the budgetary crisis with the
electronic future. By sharing existing print collections and
developing a shared digital collection, the system could make the
most of its limited resources. The budget proposal, which was
finally approved by every academic senate and by the UC
administration, emphasized resource sharing but also made up for
some of the drastic reductions that campuses had experienced in
their print budgets owing to the recession. The proposal included
some money for resource sharing (an improved interlibrary loan
program among the campuses that later turned into circulation of
the "university-wide collection") and financial support for
building a system-wide electronic environment. Upon the urging of
UCLA Provost Charles Kennel (chair of the LPAI advisory
committee) it also included an increase of more than $12 million
over three years to campus libraries for their print
collections.</p>

<h3>Initial Progress and Future Challenges</h3>

The CDL helps provide infrastructure that lowers the cost to
campus libraries of delivering high-quality online collections
and services. Its investment in bibliographic catalogs,
electronic collections, digital library tools and services
(reference linking, persistent object naming, cross-collection
searching), and consensus building around various standards and
good practices provides what the campus libraries commonly
require but are unable to develop independently. Work in three
areas&#151;Melvyl, a consorital licensing operation, and an
e-scholarship program&#151;is indicative of the progress but also
of the challenges incumbent in this approach. 

<p>Melvyl remains the jewel in CDL's crown. Well before the CDL
was established, it had gone some way toward encouraging
scholarly exploitation of campus collections as if they formed a
part of a single university collection. The addition by the CDL
of a request service through which patrons can initiate
interlibrary loan (ILL) requests online from the catalog
interface, and a courier service through which interlibrary loan
requests can be delivered overnight, greatly fostered the trend.
Since the inception of these services in 1999, the number of
interlibrary loan requests has increased dramatically. In fall
2003, the ILL service will be further enhanced with the addition
on each campus of high-volume digitization facilities capable of
digitizing requested items and delivering them to patrons online.
Yet Melvyl and its ancillary services cast a long shadow. Their
maintenance absorbs scarce technical resources and as such could
impede the pace of innovation and development that may be
required of a maturing digital library.</p>

<p>In support of a shared university collection, the CDL hosts a
consortial licensing operation that systematically acquires
access to and, where appropriate, enriches commercial electronic
materials under terms and at costs that are favorable to the UC
libraries. The shared collection of commercial electronic journal
and reference databases is available system-wide and extends
local holdings at marginal additional cost to campus libraries.
Experience with shared electronic collections is cautiously being
extended into the domain of print, but by the libraries as a
collective rather than by the CDL. As UC libraries cancel
subscriptions to printed journals that are also available
electronically, they are asking whether they can act together to
ensure that a physical copy of record is maintained at least
somewhere within the university. They are also taking an in-depth
look at strategies for managing distributed collections of
printed government documents. The discussion forces libraries to
confront very difficult issues of ownership as well as
access&#151;issues that could test the limits of
collaboration.</p>

<p>An e-scholarship program stimulates and facilitates innovation
in scholarly communication in support of research and teaching,
and includes tools and services that facilitate the creation,
production, peer review, management, and dissemination of
scholarly publications. The program responds to a recommendation
of the LPAI task force to experiment with new means of scholarly
publishing. The task force found that "the present system of
journal publication no longer meets faculty needs to distribute
information quickly and effectively" and in a manner that makes
economic sense to the university. The e-scholarship program's
biggest success is its working papers and e-prints repository.
Still in its early days, the repository is attracting deposits
from UC faculty. Changing scholarly communications, however,
requires a great deal more than new technical services and
experimentation on the part of some faculty at a single
university. It requires change in scholarly practice generally.
By providing alternative forms of scholarly communications,
libraries can exert some influence. Also required is the active
participation of&#151;even leadership from&#151;academic
quarters.</p>

<p>The CDL's early progress is due in part to fortuitous timing.
The rising cost of information and a state budget crisis helped
move CDL planning to implementation. The success of the Red Sage
Project at UC San Francisco, the creation of a statewide
consortium in Ohio (Ohiolink), and the emerging licensing models
from publishers supported the concept of shared or consortial
acquisitions of electronic scholarly journals, reference
databases, and other commercial content.</p>

<p>Support of all the campus libraries was also important,
especially from the largest, i.e., Berkeley and UCLA. By 1996,
the Berkeley library was already a nationally known center for
digital library development. Given the severity of the budget
crisis in the 1990s, some at Berkeley were concerned that funding
for CDL would decrease resources for digital library development
at the campuses. UCLA was enormously supportive; in fact, the
support of University Librarian Gloria Werner was a key factor in
the successful start of the CDL. In time, Berkeley, through
sharing its expertise and experiences, also became enormously
helpful. It has taken a lead in important collaborative digital
library developments, including the Online Archive of California
(a union catalog of finding aids) and the planning of a digital
archival repository for UC libraries.</p>

<p>Strong political alliances were equally important. The provost
of UCLA, the chair of the advisory board, and key librarians, who
had worked together and had developed trust, provided underlying
support. The health sciences librarians, who had a long history
of collaboration, provided support early on. Lucier, Werner, and
Phyllis Mirsky, deputy university librarian at UC San Diego, were
three critical leaders with health sciences backgrounds. The CDL
also benefited from a densely interlocking committee structure
that exists to this day.</p>

<p>The CDL's ability to deliver on its service promises, to move
quickly from planning to action, and to demonstrate its benefits
to the campus libraries in real and quantifiable terms has also
been important, though may be under threat as the service grows.
In its first few years, CDL released new collections and services
on a regular semiannual basis. It continues to report out on the
real savings that are involved in the development of shared
collections and digital library infrastructure. The CDL has also
fostered interchange among the campus libraries by bringing
campus staff to work at the CDL on a short-term basis (and paying
them), by hosting digital library development forums jointly with
other library committees, and by co-developing with campus
libraries various digital collections, services, and tools. It
has finally built relations with faculty who need to drive and
endorse the goals of the CDL and the system-wide library planning
agenda more generally.</p>

<p>According to Lucier, now librarian at Dartmouth College, CDL's
continued success depends on the spark of individuals who are
willing to work together and on their drive to accomplish this
work. Other challenges facing the CDL include (1) maintaining its
fiscal health during the current state budget crisis; (2)
facilitating development of a shared university library
collection that comprises both digital and print materials; (3)
developing a technical and organizational infrastructure that
enables it to manage legacy services while supporting more
speculative development initiatives undertaken on behalf of the
UC libraries; (4) encouraging faculty exploitation of alternative
means of scholarly publishing that are being developed by the
e-scholarship program; (5) continuing to stimulate and find
rewarding challenges for the CDL's very high-caliber and
energetic staff; and (6) maintaining agility in the context of a
large and rambling bureaucracy. Confronting these challenges will
require a more stable operations environment within the CDL;
continued collaboration, trust, and understanding among the UC
libraries; inclusive discussions and decision making within the
CDL; and a perpetually refreshed vision of the university
libraries' strategic directions. <a id="Harv"

The Harvard University Library (HUL) is part of Harvard's central
administration and serves as the coordinating body for the more
than 90 separate libraries that make up the Harvard library
system. HUL develops and implements library services and programs
that are centrally provided, including library systems, off-site
storage; preservation, university archives, and digital
initiatives. The largest group of Harvard libraries is found in
the Harvard College Library, which administers 11 libraries for
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the Widener
Library.</td>

<h3>History</h3>

In the mid-1990s, there was comparatively little digital library
activity at Harvard. One exception was the development of Web
portal services that opened to electronic journals and other
commercially supplied content. The reason Harvard was less active
than other universities may be due in part to the highly
decentralized structure of the university. Each of the faculties
has its own endowment, receives tuition dollars from its
students, and is taxed for common services. On the Harvard
campus, the name that has been given to this decentralized system
is "Every Tub on Its Own Bottom" (ETOB).<sup><a
href="#n1">1</a></sup> The faculties are expected to be
entrepreneurial and autonomous, and because the libraries in
effect belong to the faculties, they are also highly
decentralized. Cost recovery is an integral ingredient in ETOB;
therefore, just as the Harvard faculties pay the university for
some services, individual libraries pay the HUL for systems,
storage, and some digital library services. In turn, the HUL
provides services and products that the libraries want and need. 

<p>By the late 1990s, the involvement of HUL Associate Director
for Planning and Systems Dale Flecker in the Digital Library
Federation's program and architecture committees brought him into
contact with early major innovators. They included staff from
Michigan and Cornell, and peers in other research libraries that
were beginning to build digital library infrastructures. As a
result of discussions with Flecker and others, HUL Director Sid
Verba convened a group of administrative deans, faculty members,
and librarians. Under the chairmanship of Harvard College
Librarian Nancy Cline, the committee was charged to consider how
Harvard should begin its digital library program.</p>

<p>The committee recognized that building a common infrastructure
was of prime importance. The group's focus on building
infrastructure, as opposed to digitizing collections, reflected
the recognition that collections responsibilities were highly
distributed throughout the 90 libraries. The committee believed
that a strong infrastructure could help lower the overhead to the
libraries creating digital collections and help build coherent
information solutions. It envisaged that the central program
would have a consulting and educational role as well as
responsibility for building centralized systems and services that
would be shared by all the libraries. Through grants made to the
libraries and other parts of the university, the committee hoped
to entice the community to participate in a coordinated
infrastructure. The program was named the Library Digital
Initiative (LDI) and was placed in the Office for Information
Systems of the HUL.</p>

<p>Sid Verba argued to the university administrators,
particularly to then President Neil Rudenstine, that if Harvard
could replace its central accounting systems, a very expensive
project, it should also provide funding to develop the digital
library, an endeavor more important to fulfilling the
university's core mission. Verba requested and received one-time
funding of $12 million to be allocated over five years from
President Rudenstine's discretionary funds. Five million dollars
of this sum is being spent on the grant program, leaving $7
million for building the infrastructure. This initiative, like
others at Harvard, will eventually be supported at least in part
by cost recovery. The plan to establish and fund a digital
initiative was virtually unopposed by the faculties, in part
because new money had been found to support it and because the
library had already achieved considerable success in developing a
highly regarded Harvard union catalog.</p>

<p>The LDI's focus is practical and systems oriented; it has no
direct ties to faculty research. A reflection of Harvard's
decentralized organization, the LDI provides services to the
university's many distributed libraries. Because the role of LDI
is to provide the infrastructure and that of the libraries is to
use that infrastructure to provide services appropriate to their
particular clientele, the Harvard libraries, and not the LDI, are
meant to connect directly to the faculty. Harvard's librarians
work well with one another, sharing values, a common profession,
and a growing recognition of their interdependence. Their success
in developing a microfilm and an online catalog, as well as
completing the retrospective catalog conversion of more than five
million titles, has prepared them to look for opportunities to
develop other shared activities.</p>

<h3>Now and the Future</h3>

Because of the strong book culture at Harvard, particularly in
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Nancy Cline has approached
digitization as a logical extension of the continuum of recorded
knowledge. She believes it is Harvard's responsibility to access
and preserve digital materials in the same way that it has
accessed and preserved print materials. The LDI offers Cline and
others a place to become involved with digital library activities
and to begin to build an infrastructure even while many of the
faculty are not yet interested in or aware of the research
potential of digital materials and services. The College Library
is making a substantial commitment to e-journals and promoting
this commitment in terms of its historical role in developing
collections. Because of its strong preservation and conservation
program, the College Library is also using digital preservation
to manage heavily used print collections. 

<p>Three digital reformatting facilities are being created: one
in Widener to digitize page material; one in the art museum to
digitize photographs, slides, and art works; and one in the music
library to digitize sound and related materials. The LDI
supported building one of these centers, and the Harvard College
Library financed the other two. Each of these centers is being
integrated into the LDI infrastructure, and the digitized output
will feed directly into the depository. At this point,
digitization occurs when the library needs to minimize the
handling of selected materials or to conserve deteriorating
materials and when faculty members request that materials be
digitized (e.g., some slide and pamphlet collections). Given the
size of the collections, conservation at a very large scale is a
primary driver at Harvard.</p>

<p>To increase the use of digital materials, a number of
libraries that are being renovated are creating new kinds of
spaces for collaborative learning and for learning in a
multimedia setting. Major renovations are occurring in the
business, law, divinity, and medical libraries and in the Widener
Library. Renovations are being coupled with outreach by
librarians, who are teaching students and faculty members how to
use the Web and other digital resources.</p>

<p>The activities of the LDI staff consist of consulting,
training, and raising the awareness of the issues in digital
libraries, e.g., metadata, reformatting, and digital
acquisitions, as well as building a technical infrastructure. LDI
is a central resource for education and consulting, and its
consultations have now extended to the museums and other parts of
the university that have research collections. For the future, a
primary activity will be to continue building the
infrastructure.<sup><a href="#n2">2</a></sup> The first-generation
systems now in place include those for converting and storing
technical and descriptive metadata, access management, naming,
and cataloging. Most of the LDI effort to this point has been
spent developing systems rather than content. LDI is only now
beginning to populate its systems.</p>

<p>To access objects in the repository, metadata about the
objects must be made accessible through various LDI-maintained
online catalogs. Libraries (and others) fund the cost of
preserving and accessing materials stored in the repository. A
number of libraries are using the repository, as are the art
museum and the School of Public Health. The professional schools
are the least involved at this point. The major cooperative
effort across the libraries is still consortial purchasing, which
is accomplished at HUL by at least two full-time employees who
oversee the processes of identifying, evaluating, and negotiating
access to commercial digital content.</p>

<p>HUL recovers the marginal cost of storage and preservation
from units using the repository. LDI has defined three levels of
preservation responsibility for materials deposited in the
repository. First, LDI will assume full preservation
responsibility for materials deposited in preferred ("normative")
formats, along with the prescribed metadata. LDI will provide
only "bit preservation" for materials in a second list of
formats. Preservation of materials in formats not yet listed
remains undefined. Over time, LDI will address the preservation
status of a widening range of formats. Libraries must adhere to
the standards and expect to be billed for migration. Metadata
standards for text, images, and sound have been completed; film
and video are not. Flecker expects the repository use to grow
substantially.</p>

<p>Because President Rudenstine allocated one-time funding to the
LDI, Flecker and his office must address the issue of funding in
the next phase of the program. He worries that digital libraries
are developing more slowly than had been predicted, that the cost
of infrastructure development will be larger than estimated, and
that they may have underestimated the time needed to develop a
mature infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

Harvard faces the following challenges in developing its digital
library: 

<ol>
<li>Because Harvard is highly decentralized and wealthy, the
various faculties frequently have little reason to collaborate.
On the other hand, collaboration among the libraries has been
noticeably successful and has produced services that faculty and
students appreciate across the institution.</li>

<li>Information technology (IT) services are fragmented
throughout the institution and within the libraries. For example,
the Widener Library relies on HUL for its integrated library
system and digital library services, on the central IT Department
and the Faculty of Arts and Science's Academic Computing
Department for network support, and on both central departments
and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for administrative data. The
difficulty of developing digital library initiatives in a
distributed computer environment is matched by the difficulty the
university is experiencing in developing tools for online course
management.</li>

<li>The book budget is sacred, especially to the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. Fifty-five percent of the collections budget is
endowed (and therefore restricted); the remainder is
faculty-driven. It is difficult to use acquisitions dollars for
anything other than books and journals. This is not to say that
the faculty members do not want electronic resources: they do
want them, but they want them to be supported through funds that
supplement the traditional collections budgets. At Harvard,
senior faculty members strongly influence many decisions in the
library.</li>

<li>Faculty interest in technology is wide but conflicting. Some
faculty members want to take full advantage of the newest
technology; others, many of whom are senior faculty, do not.
Those who have a strong interest in newer options have smaller
voices; for this reason, some librarians fear that Harvard will
miss opportunities that other institutions will seize. Many
wonder whether President Lawrence Summers's notion that Harvard
should be giving more to the country will lead him to urge that
the Harvard libraries become leaders in digital preservation and
access.</li>

<li>LDI needs to make its cost recovery in digital initiatives
work. It may request significant additional presidential funding
because the required infrastructure will not be completed within
the five-year period, even though there is a solid first
generation of production systems in place. Over time, LDI hopes
to move the cost of building and updating the production systems
to one of the common goods (ETOB) paid by the faculties. LDI also
requires core funding that may exceed $1 million annually for
ongoing innovation, consulting, and outreach.</li>

<li>Future priorities for LDI include more concentration on
born-digital materials, on integration of digital library content
and infrastructure with other systems within the university
(course management systems) and with other libraries nationally,
and on digital preservation.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Harvard is developing an interesting and creative program in a
unique and difficult environment. The argument that the library
needs to demonstrate a role in digital space as a natural
outgrowth of a historical role in nondigital space is beginning
to work, but very slowly. By emphasizing infrastructure,
conservation, and preservation, the library may be able to build
a substantive collection of digital materials of all kinds, much
as the Library of Congress has done. Because of the environment,
however, library involvement in end-user services that could
actively support research and learning will vary greatly across
the university. With the approach the Harvard libraries are
taking, scholars will use the materials in the digital repository
in their research, much as they do now with books, but the
library could remain more or less in a traditional role for some
time into the future.

<h3>History</h3>

When Suzanne Thorin assumed the post of dean of libraries at
Indiana University (IU) in 1996, the libraries had no formal
digital library program. There were, however, three
"bright-light" initiatives: VARIATIONS, a streaming audio music
e-reserves project; LETRS (Library Electronic Text Resource
Service); and DIDO (Digital Images Delivered Online), an
art-image data bank that served the School of Fine Arts. None of
these projects had base funding in the libraries, although LETRS
had been provided staff from University Information Technology
Services (UITS) since the former's inception in the late 1980s. 

<p>VARIATIONS, one of the earliest streaming audio experiments,
operated in a "skunk-works" environment in the campus music
library. The music library was headed by David Fenske, now dean
of the College of Information Science and Technology at Drexel
University. Fenske drew funds for the project on an ad hoc basis
from the deans of the music school and libraries and from UITS.
IBM provided some equipment and advice. Jon Dunn, an information
technologist who has had a major role in shaping the Digital
Library Program (DLP), was the primary technical force behind
VARIATIONS.</p>

<p>LETRS was begun in the early 1990s as a partnership between
the libraries and the computing center, with joint staffing,
space provided by the library, and equipment provided by the
computing center. It provided the model upon which the DLP was
eventually built.</p>

<p>One abiding characteristic at Indiana, which exists in part
because of limited funding, is a robust collaboration between the
libraries and information technology (IT) units. In the 1980s,
with the advent of NOTIS, the first eight-campus library
management system, the two entities recognized that they would be
forever joined&#151;for better or for worse. The libraries had
long relied on UITS for storage and security of their digital
output. During the late 1980s, the relationship grew. Librarians
and technologists established INFORM, a discussion group where
the two cultures informally explored matters of mutual interest
and got to know each other's worlds. These discussions produced a
series of campus forums that culminated in a national Public
Broadcasting System teleconference called "Networked Information
and the Scholar."</p>

<p>In January 1997, six months after Thorin arrived at IU,
Michael McRobbie, who came from the Australian National
University, became Indiana's vice-president and chief information
officer (CIO). With academic computing and administrative
computing already merged and the addition of telecommunications
to the IT organization nearly completed, McRobbie began to direct
IT at the Bloomington and Indianapolis campuses, which had
previously been administered separately. With funding from
President Myles Brand, McRobbie was able to transform long-term
and divisive discussions about equipment into an action plan for
campus-wide purchases through life-cycle funding. Brand and
McRobbie also obtained additional state funding for technology to
support teaching and learning.</p>

<p>All eight campuses subsequently participated in extended
discussions that led to the adoption of a three-year IT strategic
plan under which base and one-time funding was allocated for
existing digital library projects, including VARIATIONS; the
digital library program, including research and development; and
electronic records management. Thus, through a plan that
incorporates resources to implement it, a centralized ("czar")
model for IT has evolved at the eight-campus university.</p>

<p>Before the discussions that led to the IT strategic plan took
place, Thorin struggled with how to shape decentralized and
underfunded digital projects and to build a broader, more
cohesive digital environment in the libraries. (Thorin had
planned the first technology conference at the Library of
Congress when Librarian of Congress James Billington sought
advice about turning American Memory into a real national digital
library.) She engaged Michael Keller, university librarian and
director of academic resources at Stanford University, as a
consultant. She also explored activities taking place at the
University of Michigan, where Dan Atkins and others were building
a robust digital library environment. McRobbie, as well as Blaise
Cronin, dean of the School of Library and Information Science
(SLIS), were enthusiastic about adopting the Michigan model, with
UITS, the libraries, and the SLIS as partners. ,p&gt; With
Keller's recommendations in hand, Thorin reorganized Library
Information Technology by merging two departments and appointing
a new director, Phyllis Davidson, to a joint UITS/libraries
position. Kristine Brancolini, long-time head of media and
reserves for the library and a copyright expert, was appointed
director of the DLP.</p>

<p>This early developmental period was filled with change, and
not all library staff were happy with what was unfolding. The
creation of the DLP and related events temporarily destabilized
what had long been a predictable environment.</p>

<p>With respect to presidential leadership in IT, the situation
at Indiana was similar to that at Michigan. At Michigan,
then-President James Duderstadt worked through a number of
colleagues in the School of Engineering and in IT to foster
change. Indiana's Brand has given consistent and enthusiastic
support to IT, primarily through McRobbie's leadership.
McRobbie's support has helped numerous efforts, including the
DLP, proliferate, particularly on the Bloomington and
Indianapolis campuses. This approach is also making
implementation of current multicampus efforts, such as building
an effective course management system and dealing with
e-scholarship, a more cohesive process than it is in the
decentralized environments at some large institutions.</p>

<h3>Growth</h3>

At first, Brancolini and Dunn were the only full-time DLP staff
members other than the technical UITS staff in LETRS and the
full-time systems administrator in the music library. Others who
participated part time included the head of preservation and an
area studies catalog librarian, who added metadata expertise. The
team's early efforts to obtain grants were unsuccessful. These
failures were learning experiences both in writing grants and in
building technical expertise. By the time Indiana was awarded a
$3-million National Science Foundation grant in 2000 to expand
VARIATIONS into a digital music library for teaching and
learning, the program had achieved great success in
grantsmanship. 

<p>As DLP staff grew as a result of support from the UITS
strategic plan and reallocation of library staff, the roles of
the partners changed. Perhaps because the SLIS gets its academic
credibility from linking with other academic units rather than
with library or technology services, its involvement has
diminished, except where it contributes funding for a specific
purpose, e.g., encoded archival description (EAD)
training.<sup><a href="#n3">3</a></sup> The recent addition of the
School of Informatics to the DLP partnership gives the program a
new opportunity for an applied research component. Overall, the
maturing program has worked in the following five areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>building program, staff, organization, structure, and
funding</li>

<li>stabilizing funding and technology for VARIATIONS, LETRS, and
DIDO</li>

<li>building expertise through national collaboration</li>

<li>building integrating technology at the lowest level (server
storage that can be used by multiple projects) and at the next
level (the software infrastructure)</li>

<li>integrating the DLP into the libraries' operations</li>
</ol>

Organizationally, the program reports to the dean and has a
mandate to roam and create both in the Bloomington libraries and
on the other IU campuses. To explore program integration,
Brancolini, Davidson, and associate deans Martha Brogan and
Harriette Hemmasi have held weekly discussions for more than a
year and have codified all the libraries' digital efforts to set
the stage for developing a plan for the future. The DLP is also
exploring how faculty can interact more deeply with the program
and how the program can exert influence in Indiana's research
environment. There are a number of faculty-led DLP projects,
including one in folklore being considered for Mellon funding and
another in archaeology/informatics, but there is as yet no
consistent or organized participation. Now that it has emerged
from the nuts-and-bolts stage and is maturing, the program has an
opportunity to move to a more integrated and strategic
institutional approach. 

<h3>Challenges</h3>

Indiana now faces challenges in technology and strategic
thinking. 

<ul>
<li><i>Technology</i>. When the program began, it inherited the
infrastructure available to VARIATIONS and LETRS to deal with
audio and texts, and since that time, staff have built up
technology expertise in images (e.g., DIDO, the Hoagy Carmichael
Collection). With the technology infrastructure being built piece
by piece, the present challenge is to integrate digital content
now located in a variety of software and hardware environments.
The DLP has an opportunity to take advantage of the IU mass
storage service, which includes tape and disk base storage for
all types of data, in 1- to 2-terabyte disk caches and tape
libraries that have a 300-terabyte total capacity. Research data
of all sorts are being stored, and VARIATIONS is the
second-largest user through its WAV and MPEG files. (The largest
user is high-energy physics.) With UITS facility providing a
general low-level infrastructure, the DLP will work on the
administrative and management access software layer that would
sit on top of the mass storage and enable cross-collection
searching. 

<p>To explore the creation of a digital repository, the DLP is
looking at general services that it could provide to units in the
library and on the campuses that might want the DLP to manage,
preserve, and provide access to digital information. With the new
emphasis on partnerships within the libraries and an evolving
role for Library Information Technology, staff will have
increasing roles in these endeavors.<sup><a href="#n4">4</a></sup>
Through a working group of librarians, IT staff, and faculty,
this concept will be explored in fall 2002. The DLP's
participation as a beta site in FEDORA (Flexible and Extensible
Digital Object and Repository Architecture), a University of
Virginia Libraries venture to build a repository, is part of IU's
own repository exploration.</p>

<p>The other main technology ingredient in IU's digital library
program is the University of Michigan's DLXS (Digital Library
Extension Service) software, which is used in LETRS, where they
have implemented the text class and will be implementing the
image class in the future. The extent to which DLXS integrates
with FEDORA and other work remains to be seen, but DLXS does not
provide a repository solution at any rate.</p>
</li>

<li><i>Strategic Thinking</i>. The DLP is struggling to find
effective ways to codify and to communicate its knowledge to a
broader community. In some respects this is a promotional
activity&#151;and opportunity. In addition, the program needs
staff who are dedicated to infrastructure development and do not
have project responsibilities. With such success in obtaining
grants, the number of projects keeps growing, and the thinking
that needs to take place about the overall infrastructure keeps
moving into the background. The program believes it can make its
mark in the humanities and the performing arts. 

<p>Because it is unlikely that numbers of additional staff will
be hired (except temporarily through grant support), the DLP is
challenged to use existing resources to build an integrated
program. The meetings involving Brancolini, Davidson, Brogan, and
Hemmasi have been productive in sorting out what parts of the
library and the DLP can take leadership on any issue. In the case
of the Teaching and Learning Technology Center, now being built
in the main library, for example, there are opportunities for DLP
staff and bibliographers to interact with faculty who are
learning how to integrate technology into their classes.
Leadership for placing the libraries' created and purchased
digital information into the course management system, OnCourse,
is also a shared responsibility.</p>

<p>Potentially fruitful points of contact between DLP and other
parts of the library include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Research and Development (R&amp;D): Does R&amp;D occur mainly
in the DLP and cross into the library? Can the libraries request
that the DLP conduct R&amp;D for needs in their areas?</li>

<li>Metadata: What is the relationship of the new metadata
librarian in technical services to the DLP and to the repository
project?</li>

<li>Equipment: How can Library Information Technology partner
with the DLP to ensure that the libraries have an IT framework
that suits the DLP ventures?</li>

<li>Faculty projects: Some faculty will approach bibliographers,
and others will come to the DLP. How can efforts be integrated so
that the faculty members get the best services?</li>
</ul>

The absence of a shared vision concerning the library's digital
future will lead to focusing on second-order issues, such as who
does what or who is stepping on another's boundaries. It will
also promote duplication and limit progress. Therefore, the
fruitful discussions that the four managers have had and that
have produced an impressive list of existing endeavors need to be
transformed into real strategic planning. 

<h3>Summary</h3>

Although Indiana was not one of the early digital library
pioneers, it has developed its digital program rapidly in the
past six years. Capitalizing on a coherent, multicampus IT
environment that is adequately funded, the digital library
program has concentrated on building expertise and gaining a
national reputation. Its current challenge is to build an
integrated library through system-wide planning and
implementation&#151;a library system that capitalizes on the
university's strong centralized IT structure and is motivated by
critical changes taking place in teaching, learning, and
research.

<h3>History</h3>

When Carol Mandel was appointed dean of libraries at New York
University (NYU) in April 1999, she found little digital library
development under way. The reason for this vacuum was a very
traditional approach to teaching and learning at the
university&#151;an approach that was mirrored in the library. 

<p>Before 1998, NYU's information technology (IT) infrastructure
was highly fragmented, comprising three independent units that
reported to three vice-presidents: administrative computing,
academic computing, and telecommunications. The units were
operationally successful each year, but no strategic or
multiple-year planning took place. In fact, at that time the
university administration did not view IT as being a significant
factor in NYU's planning.</p>

<p>For years, the library administration had discouraged
collaboration with the IT units; as a result, none occurred,
except where creative staff worked together across lines by
stealth or at least without formal sanction or encouragement.
Although the library provided television services and media
support for campus classrooms, there was little synergy among and
within the organizations. Lacking a strong campus technology
infrastructure, the library network was cobbled together.</p>

<p>Things began to change in the early 1990s, when the library
received a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to produce
an online catalog that would provide links from the catalog to
full-text commercial and government resources via a Z39.50
interface. This initiative was soon overtaken by new technology,
notably the World Wide Web. The grant enabled NYU libraries to
test some technology applications; e.g., they developed online
finding aids that linked to digital surrogates for selected
holdings. However, the original purpose of the grant was not
realized, which disappointed staff and impeded progress in
planning for the digital future. Additional factors that impeded
progress included the unsupported technical environment, the
absence of standards, and the lack of library staff who had the
technical skills to apply the few standards that were available
and who had relevant project design and management skills.</p>

<p>In 1992, the university administration convened a faculty
committee to investigate the effectiveness of academic computing.
Libraries were included in the committee's mandate. A subsequent
committee recommended that a chief information technology officer
(CITO) be appointed to look after a full range of computing.</p>

<p>In 1998, Marilyn McMillan was appointed CITO and the IT units
were merged. McMillan instituted a stronger technical support
system and increased the hours of the help desk from eight hours
a day to 24/7. By the time Mandel was interviewed, she recognized
that the university had come to view the effective use of IT as
essential to its research and teaching missions. The new
administration expected that the CITO and the dean of libraries
would work as a team.</p>

<p>Together, Mandel and McMillan worked, as they put it, "to take
the clippers to the barbed-wire fence" that had been built
between the separate information organizations. They formed a
team of staff members who had collaborated on technology-related
matters behind the scenes, and this team identified areas where
the two units could work together. These areas included
infrastructure, the library's network, digital library
development, authentication, and publications. As a first and
highly symbolic effort, the organizations merged their existing
handbooks for faculty and students into a single publication. The
team offered other suggestions that helped Mandel and McMillan
restructure, retool, and staff their respective
organizations.</p>

<p>In the recent past, new money had not been available, but the
library and the IT units often saved what they called "budget
dust," or year-end funds. Since Mandel and McMillan have been
working together, a limited amount of new money has been made
available to the units. In fiscal year 2000/2001, each
organization received program improvement funds that are being
used to build infrastructure. In addition, in March 2001, the
board of trustees voted to impose a technology fee of $50 per
term for full- and part-time students enrolled in degree programs
and to earmark the proceeds for the improvement of student
computing services.</p>

<p>With some restructuring in place, Mandel and McMillan are
exploring how to effect other needed changes. They are discussing
the merit of some shared library/IT positions. Librarians have
academic status and tenure, but Mandel has some flexibility to
appoint new staff who have digital library skills and experience.
Although the two have no formal plan for building their digital
presence, they have used a shared approach to articulate the
purposes, goals, and benefits of the digital library initiative
in various planning and budget documents. These descriptions will
be part of a discussion in a new deans' working group on
libraries and information technology that will feed into planning
under way as part of a new presidential administration. The plan
will need to be in alignment with the administration, but seminal
work being accomplished now will create the platform on which to
develop specific digital goals.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>

The platform being built includes the following tactical
initiatives: 

<ol>
<li>Hiring appropriately skilled personnel. Although NYU has a
number of talented digital library staff (most of whom are
supported by grant funds and some of whom are on loan from IT),
they need to build a stable team using base funding.</li>

<li>Conducting selective experimentation through discrete
projects to help design the infrastructure requirements for the
future.</li>

<li>Building storage capacity. David Ackerman, director of
eServices, and Peter Brantley, director of library information
technology, have been working with Sun Microsystems to create a
Digital Library Center of Excellence. NYU had been building a
portal using Sun infrastructure, and the libraries took the
initiative to interest Sun in building the center. The libraries
also made Ex Libris a third partner in this effort, after working
with the company to implement SFX reference linking. Sun products
will supply very significant computing and storage capacity (SF
15K), which the library will divide into two areas: (1) research
and development and (2) production and other necessary digital
library infrastructure components.</li>

<li>Designing a program around NYU's strengths and needs while
positioning the library nationally and internationally in a
leadership role. The current thinking is that NYU will build on
its strengths in the performing arts (audio and video) and on its
orientation toward visual and multimedia materials from many
subject areas taught and researched at NYU, including performance
and film studies. The program will build on NYU's location in a
city that values visual and performing arts. It will emphasize
the university's strengths in computer science, in intellectual
property law, and in selected special collections. Mandel and
McMillan want to make progress in the difficult area of copyright
for multimedia and believe they can provide national leadership
in this area. 

<p>Through a program funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,
the libraries are focusing on how to clear copyright for recorded
music so that it may be used in educational settings. Rights and
authentication issues are main emphases of the NYU programs. In
the Napster debate, for example, NYU students were concerned not
only about sharing music files but also about maintaining the
rights to the materials they had created themselves.</p>

<p>The University Press reports to the dean of libraries. Mandel
hopes to position the press to produce reference works
electronically. Mandel and the press director are debating how
and what to digitize. In addition, Mandel wants to digitize
material that is high profile&#151;i.e., that has eye-catching
content&#151;to bring the libraries good publicity. The library
is highly regarded by the faculty already because it consistently
publicizes its efforts.</p>

<p>Mandel and McMillan also muse about other issues: How can we
increase production? Who are our natural partners? What
born-digital material should we collect and preserve? Should we
digitize our brittle books? How can we relate more closely to
teaching and learning? How can we use Mellon support to preserve
moving images? How can we develop a program that is integrated
into both the library and the campus?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Obstacles</h3>

Potential obstacles lie in two principal areas: technical and
personnel. 

<p><i>Technical</i>. There is considerable demand for bandwidth
at NYU, with 20,000 students in residence halls and others in
rented facilities where ISP services are needed. Although this
problem exists nationwide, it is more intense at NYU because of
its city campuses, which use instructional learning technologies
heavily. In spring 2000, 30 courses used Blackboard, Inc.,
software for online teaching; by spring 2001, 700 classes with
8,000 students were using instructional technologies. NYU offers
some 7,000 classes with online components, and growth is
exponential. Another obstacle is the unpredictable nature of the
market for technology. Different components of the university's
core infrastructure will become obsolete at different times,
fundamentally changing the nature and demands for
interoperability. Again, this is not a problem that is unique to
NYU.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the work that NYU has accomplished in
developing its portal has given the staff broad and deep
experience with front-end applications. They have confidence that
they can continue to meet and exceed the expectations of their
community.</p>

<p><i>Personnel</i>. Challenges include finding appropriately
skilled new library staff members as well as developing and
retraining the existing staff. The differences between library
and IT cultures is also a concern. The culture of librarians with
tenure may be a barrier at a time when teamwork and the
amalgamation of library, professional, and technical cultures are
necessary for success. There is also a lingering legacy of
skepticism among library staff members, who witnessed earlier
failed efforts at technology innovation. Finally, a major issue
is whether the library and the IT groups can obtain enough
financial support to build a viable program.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The energy in NYU's startup program is contagious. While the
staff and dean think out loud (they call it "trolling and
sniffing"), they have actually created the time needed to
reflect, explore, and shape their program while they build the
infrastructure needed for continued excellence. <a id="MI"

<h3>History</h3>

Distributed computing was emerging at Michigan in 1991 in a
campus-wide mainframe environment with a proprietary but robust
operating system, the Michigan Terminal System, that had its
origins in the 1960s. Daniel Atkins, then interim dean of the
School of Engineering, and Doug Van Houweling, soon-to-be
vice-provost for Information Technology, became concerned about
how distributed computing would change Michigan's information
environment and whether the library could adapt to the change. 

<p>Along with Donald Riggs, director of the University Library at
that time, the two administrators led a yearlong symposium on
library information technology and on how the library would need
to transform itself in a networked environment. In another group,
which was chaired by former University of Michigan President
Robben Fleming and included Dean Robert Warner of the School of
Library and Information Studies, Atkins, Riggs, and Van Houweling
distilled the first report into three recommendations:</p>

<ol>
<li>The complementary expertise of the library and the campus
information technology (IT) communities should be harnessed.</li>

<li>The university should invest in visible projects to learn by
doing.</li>

<li>An information community based on library principles should
be created.</li>
</ol>

Provost Gil Whitaker presented the recommendations to an
enthusiastic President James Duderstadt. Meanwhile, the authors
had already decided to take a next step: investing $375,000 to
develop their ideas and to jump-start the changes. They asked
Wendy Lougee to take a one-year leave of absence from her
position as head of the graduate library to assume responsibility
for building a collaborative digital environment. She was given
independence from the library administration, a separate budget,
and an office in the graduate library. Lougee was charged with
developing projects that would test technologies and bring the
three partners together synergistically. 

<p>When Lougee began her work, the three organizations were very
different from what they are today. The Information Technology
Department (ITD) was a large organization with more than 600
full-time employees that focused mostly on infrastructure; the
School of Library and Information Studies (SILS), under Atkins,
was just beginning to think about re-engineering itself; and the
library operated in a traditional mode.</p>

<p>Atkins, who had already developed close ties with a number of
publishers and foundations, especially Kellogg Foundation and the
National Science Foundation (NSF), took the lead in applying for
grant funding. He brought leading figures to Michigan to observe
the program and to engage in discussion about its future. Atkins
always included representatives from the library in these
discussions because he valued librarians' knowledge about how to
organize information. Van Houweling removed some ITD staff from
day-to-day operations and lent them to the digital effort.</p>

<p>A big boost to the program's credibility occurred in 1994,
when NSF, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
and NASA awarded SILS a Digital Library1 grant. The grant
supported an investigation of agent architecture (decomposition
of query mode with various software programs) to define and
develop interfaces and an infrastructure for users and providers
that would create a comprehensive "library" environment. At this
point, the library and SILS began to work effectively together.
Librarians brought their expertise in the principles of
librarianship, service ethics, and an understanding of
collections to the research team, which included economists,
psychologists, and educational researchers. Engineers, who mostly
guided the project, were somewhat dismissive of librarians'
input. Michigan's participation in the TULIP project,<sup><a
href="#n5">5</a></sup> its early JSTOR testing of 10 economic
journals, and its leadership in PEAK provided complementary
research and helped infuse content into the project.</p>

<p>By 1996, Lougee believed the digital library program needed
dedicated staff. Van Houweling contributed $400,000 so that
Lougee could hire IT staff; the Media Union's IT director, Randy
Frank, agreed to provide machine-room support for digital library
services and equipment up to $250,000 per year. The library also
contributed funding. The result of this financial support was the
birth of what is now called Digital Library Production Services
(DLPS) and the involvement of expert campus technologists who
worked on evolving models for storage and connectivity. (NSFnet
began at the University of Michigan.) A few years earlier, Lougee
had recruited John Price Wilkin to return to Michigan to head the
Humanities Text Initiative (HTI), and in 1996 he was appointed to
head DLPS. DLPS pulled together various activities that had
hitherto been scattered across the campus and initiated creative
thinking about how to integrate a range of projects and to build
the infrastructure necessary to do so.</p>

<p>In the mid-1990s, Michigan participated in or directed a
number of format-based projects: the Museum Educational Site
Licensing Project (images), HTI (encoded text), JSTOR (page-based
documents), and fledgling work with numeric data. Also during
this period, Michigan developed, with Cornell University, the
Making of America (MOA), a digital library that documents
American social history from 1850 until 1877. Michigan scanned
about 1,600 monographs and nine journals and focused on access
(searchable text), while Cornell focused on preservation
(facsimiles).<sup><a href="#n8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1995, Lougee was promoted to an assistant director of the
University Library. At this point, the digital library program
was represented through her membership on the library's
administrative team. She used financial incentives to entice
library staff to participate in the initiatives and allocated
funding for staff development in the digital arena. Lougee was
also given responsibility for selecting e-content for the library
and began to work with library selectors, vendors, and
publishers. During the period of collaboration with Atkins and
Van Houweling, Lougee's independence and role as a change agent
made some in the library administration uncomfortable. But with a
different library director, William Gosling, Lougee's new role as
a high-level administrator in the library, and increasing
opportunities for staff, the digital library program began to
gain some of the recognition internally that it already received
nationally.</p>

<h3>Abrupt Change</h3>

In fall 1995, James Duderstadt announced his resignation. A new
president, Lee Bollinger, was appointed in November 1996. He
appointed Nancy Cantor as provost. Atkins resigned as dean of the
School of Information and resumed a faculty position, and Van
Houweling left Michigan to become the president of the University
Corporation for Advanced Internet Development. Active university
support for and interest in the digital library program vanished
almost overnight. However, Provost Cantor did give the library
significant unrestricted money, which enabled Gosling to move a
number of digital library staff from soft to base funding. Within
two years, the atmosphere at Michigan, along with the priorities
of the institution, had completely changed. Gone were the days
when Atkins and Van Houweling could walk in the back door of the
president's home and discuss the digital future. 

<p>While moving from a mainframe to a distributed environment,
the ITD, under Van Houweling, was still a large organization that
included telecommunications and academic and administrative
computing. Jose Marie Griffiths, who succeeded Van Houweling,
reorganized the Office of the Vice-Provost and decentralized
computing responsibilities. Around 1998, administrative computing
was removed from ITD and distributed among the various campus
units. Griffiths, who also held the title of chief information
officer, created an office separate from operations that
"overlooked" the variety of campus information technology
providers. Instead of managing computer operations, she
concentrated on policies and enterprise-wide projects such as the
development of myUmich, a portal. The heads of the various IT
units did not report to Griffiths (except through a dotted line
on the organization charts); instead, they reported to a variety
of individuals in the administration, such as the provost,
vice-provost, and dean.</p>

<p>In 2001, with Griffiths's departure, along with that of
Bollinger and Cantor, psychology professor James Hilton was
appointed associate provost for academic information. He does not
hold the title or responsibilities of a chief information
officer. Hilton argues that the pendulum has swung so far to a
distributed environment that it is likely to swing back to some
centralized functions in the future. His philosophy is that the
central IT unit should provide the core infrastructure, with the
schools and colleges adding applications on top of it. Hilton
defines core services as the network, security, and other
elements that the smaller schools and colleges would define as
core.</p>

<p>At present, Michigan's IT environment could be described as
fairly chaotic. The institution moved suddenly from a president
who was evangelical about IT to one who seemed to believe it was
tangential. Seven years after Duderstadt's departure and the
appointment and departure of other high-level administrators, a
new president will need to address the legacy of two dramatically
different approaches to information technology.</p>

<p>According to Hilton, the most distinctive feature at Michigan
today may be the depth of its distributed IT environment. Like
Harvard, Michigan has considerable financial support, and the
various schools and colleges operate autonomously&#151;"tubs on
their own bottoms"&#151;as at Harvard. The IT environment is
diverse, and the individual units have few reasons to cooperate
with one another or to invest in an institutional approach.
Central IT provides services by agreement only with units that
choose not to develop their own information technology
infrastructure. The challenge is how to build collaboration in
the present distributed environment. Creating common course
management tools is a special challenge, as is bringing library
resources and services easily into a Michigan instructor's online
environment.</p>

<h3>Today</h3>

The rich collaboratory that flourished under Duderstadt
diminished with his departure. However, library funding added by
former Provost Cantor and funding transferred from Griffiths to
the library have increased the library's digital library base to
$6 million. DLPS currently supports 30 full-time equivalent
positions. The School of Information, under Dean John King,
continues to support a percentage of three digital library
salaries, but at this point the school's collaboration with the
library is minimal. The digital library program is now embedded
solely in the library. At the time Lougee left Michigan in June
2002 to become university librarian at the University of
Minnesota, her portfolio had expanded to include the Library
System Office, Desktop Support Services, Digital Library
Production Services, and the recently created Scholarly
Publishing Office (SPO). She was instrumental in overlaying a
traditional library organization with groups that deal with
issues such as access to electronic resources, networked
information, e-collection, and information technology policies
and priorities. 

<p>The program itself has moved into a production phase. No
longer do staff members encode every text; instead, DLPS has
built a core infrastructure with a framework of minimal encoding
that can be supported across media. They have defined various
object classes and produced several interchange formats that
enable them to leverage similar functionality across corpora.</p>

<p>With digital preservation now the policy in the library, DLPS
has responsibility for digitizing books for preservation
purposes. Specific collections are not targeted; instead,
preservation staff select titles to be digitized using the
condition of the object as the measure. In cases where the books
are disbound (and sometimes even when they are not), the book is
not recreated in paper, rebound, and returned to the shelf or
even returned to the shelf after digitizing; instead, it is
available only online. Selecting materials for this growing
database of digitally reformatted content, for the most part,
takes place at some distance from the scholarly community.</p>

<p>The chief purposes of the SPO are to increase interaction with
the faculty and to experiment with new publishing models. The SPO
aids faculty authors in finding alternative venues for
publishing. It also works with small society or university
presses to migrate existing print publications to digital. The
office specializes in creating born-digital publications and in
developing and enhancing electronic versions of conventional
print publications. It also helps develop mechanisms for
publication and distribution of scholarly digital research
projects.</p>

<p>Finally, the digital program sells memberships to other
libraries to its search engine and middleware so that they can
develop their digital library collections. This Digital Library
Extension Service offers members a suite of tools for mounting
collections, including text, images, bibliographic data, and
finding aids. Training workshops and e-mail support are provided
with membership, which has expanded to 27 institutions
worldwide.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The history of the University of Michigan's digital library
program is extraordinary in nearly every way. Its beginnings
document what can only be called planets in alignment: a
visionary president who contributed funding and nurtured an
experimental environment and administrators who encouraged
collaboration across the academic community. Michigan's digital
library program, while still supported magnificently, is now a
library-based program that is focused primarily on reformatting
and providing services to other libraries and organizations.
Changing leadership at the university level has forced changes in
the digital library program. With the departure of Lougee, the
last of the adventurers from the Duderstadt period, it will be
interesting to track how Michigan's program evolves in the next
years.

<h3>History</h3>

In the early 1990s, the University of Virginia (UVA) libraries
were largely traditional in their services and thinking. Kendon
Stubbs, a visionary and long-time UVA library administrator,
began scanning the horizon looking for trends and markers that
could point to future directions that the library needed to
consider. He encouraged interested colleagues in the library and
the university to talk about the future. Stubbs realized that the
impact of technology on the academy would create fundamental
changes within the library. As a bold first step, he appointed
David Seaman,<sup><a href="#n9">9</a></sup> then an English
Department graduate student, to establish an Electronic Text
Center in Alderman Library. The center opened in 1992. Since
then, it has sought to build and maintain an Internet-accessible
collection of SGML texts and images and to establish user
communities adept at the creation and use of these materials. 

<p>Therein lies the heart and soul of Virginia's digital library
program: it is focused on the scholar. The center's goal was to
encourage e-text creation within the scholarly community, and it
structured its work around faculty interests, using scholars and
graduate students to help select and encode the texts. The staff
of the Electronic Text Center are direct links to the faculty and
have work spaces in areas of the library where faculty can find
them easily. Early on, their efforts "created a buzz," even
though the first projects were opportunistic. Seaman contacted
high-profile faculty and persuaded them to use electronic
materials and to spread the news across the campus. From 1993
until 1997, the center taught many faculty members how to create
searchable texts. Seaman characterizes this service as a "big
honey pot&#151;a real attraction for the library." But, at that
point (as now) faculty interested in using electronic resources
were outnumbered by those who either were not interested or who
actively defended traditional library services.</p>

<p>At the same time the Electronic Text Center was being set up,
the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH)
was being created for faculty. Stubbs made sure that IATH in
effect "grew up in the library," where it now supports a
full-time staff of nine. In addition to staff, two fellows in
residence and nearly two dozen other fellows have active research
projects, several of which have their homes in the Alderman
Library. Having IATH located in the library enabled the library
to enrich its experimentation with faculty-led production and use
of electronic resources. Through the University's support for
IATH, the library, which is usually short on resources, receives
an infusion of benefits.</p>

<p>University Librarian Karin Wittenborg recalls that during the
early years of digital library development, she worked hard to
elicit the support of the deans. The university president, an
advocate of the library generally, did not climb aboard the
digital library effort until he visited the Electronic Text
Center and learned what was being done there. Fortuitously,
Martha Blodgett was the successful candidate in a national search
for the position of associate university librarian for
information technology. Blodgett had been at UVA in the campus
Information Technology and Communication (ITC) Department. Since
her appointment in the library, she has been instrumental in
fostering collaboration between ITC and the library. The
Instructional Toolkit, a project Blodgett headed while in ITC, is
an example of an ITC service that had not previously interested
the library, even though the toolkit included a module for
"library resources." The toolkit provides the resources to
create, distribute via the Web, and manage instructors' online
course packets. Once in the library, Blodgett was able to
identify electronic reserves as a potential toolkit use that fit
with library priorities. Now, 80 percent of the faculty members
have toolkit pages, and the library receives regular accolades
from the faculty for the range of scanning and toolkit support
services it offers. At first, Wittenborg notes, the students were
not a driving force in the digital program, but now she can count
on them to push new technology developments.</p>

<p>One of the interesting aspects of Virginia's human resources
environment is flexibility, both in the use of space and in staff
assignments. Instead of building a production facility outside
the library organization, the program at Virginia has worked
within the organization from the start. To provide space for IATH
and the Electronic Text Center, staff were, as Wittenborg put it,
"clumped." Those doing traditional work who occupied prime space
were moved to less publicly accessible spaces. As the success of
the program grew, the staff members who were physically
displaced, along with others, could and did take credit for that
success. It is useful to note that librarians at Virginia do not
have tenure or teaching faculty status, even though they are
included in the category of "general faculty." Instead, they have
three-year appointments that are renewable. The basic requirement
for a librarian position is a master of library science degree or
some other relevant master's degree. The staff is not unionized.
These qualities maximize the library's flexibility in appointing
and reassigning staff. In addition, for the past 10 years, staff
members have been encouraged to spend 10 to 20 hours a week
working in units outside their own. As the digital centers
evolved, staff members from all parts of the library participated
through this "staff-sharing" program. Ideas hatched and skills
acquired were brought back to home units. Also, subject selectors
were required to develop Web pages for the academic departments
that they serve, thereby giving them firsthand experience with
creating an online resource. Flexibility is also evident in the
higher administration. Wittenborg described a time when the
library had no funds and appealed to the provost to make a
critical hire. Her request was approved within a day.</p>

<h3>Now and the Future</h3>

The fluidity within the library has nurtured interdisciplinary
collaboration among the faculty members. Where they used to
retreat to their studies, faculty members now confer with one
another in the library in collaboratory settings. These spaces
have been cobbled together, not through renovation dollars but
because of an entrepreneurial spirit. The library supplies
physical space, equipment, and large-scale support for almost any
kind of digitizing operation, including support for grant-funded
and other faculty research projects. The digital future,
including the development of digital collections and any new
services, is closely linked to faculty needs. 

<p>In its early stages, the library made a commitment to
purchasing e-resources with a view to developing a critical
mass&#151;or, in David Seaman's words, "enough stuff to make it
interesting." The library also made a commitment to integrate
e-resources in the catalog&#151;wherever there is both a print
and an electronic version, the catalog employs a single record.
In recent years, the library has created a digital content fund,
that is, an allocation from the acquisitions budget that is
targeted to specific nonbibliographic digital content, full-text,
image, or statistical or other data. That funding is provided for
one-time purchases and for subscriptions for up to three years,
at which time each subscription is evaluated for continuing
support within the regular acquisitions budget. This transitional
mode helps subject librarians think about how to use collections
funds for both digital and traditional materials. As for
e-resources, Virginia has purchased fewer than the median of
Association of Research Libraries (ARL) until recently, when the
library set a goal to be in the top quarter of all ARL
libraries.</p>

<p>To move this successful program further into the future,
Wittenborg and the associate library directors have initiated the
development of the "library of tomorrow," which seeks to blend
digital and traditional library services. In beginning this
project, the library formed five planning teams to explore issues
and to make recommendations. The library administration expected
to have about five volunteers for each team, but when they sent
out a call for participation, they received requests from more
than 80 staff members, or a third of the staff. As a result, each
of the five planning teams had more than 15 members. Documents
were posted electronically as they emerged. Thus far, groups have
recommended a digital library production services unit and more
emphasis on digital library research and development.</p>

<p>The central production service, established in August 2001, is
the vehicle for library-initiated digital production. The staff
is deciding what to digitize and what to purchase in all the
formats. There is some tension between the centers and the
central production unit over roles and responsibilities, but this
conflict will likely be worked out in time. The second
recommendation has resulted in a prototype digital repository
using FEDORA built in collaboration with the Computer Science
Department at Cornell University and funded by The Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation (Payette et al. 1999).</p>

<p>The dual emphases of the digital program are (1) to serve as a
central repository and a production unit, both of which leverage
and support the work of what are now three digital centers
(e-text, geostat, and digital media); and (2) to build a set of
robust services for the faculty through information
communities.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The relatively small size of the University of Virginia and the
physical environment of the campus have contributed to the
success of this program, which is tailored to the research and
teaching needs of the faculty. With the library sharing its
spaces with scholars and concentrating on their continued active
involvement, this program emerges as a fine example of an
integrated, holistic approach to building a digital library. 

<p>The library is contending with a number of challenges. These
include the integration of different formats (e.g., text, images,
GIS) that will be archived in the repository. It will be a
challenge to manage content and to deliver it into different and
often unimaginable service environments. A further challenge is
to identify what higher-level services should be built. In this
respect, Virginia's strength is in its centers, where strong
relationships with faculty, and hence a good understanding of
future needs, have been developed. Without much additional
funding from the university, the library at Virginia has
reallocated and redistributed its own resources, has been
enormously successful at obtaining grants, and has built what may
be the only deeply scholar-centered digital library program in
the country.</p>
