<h2>About the Authors</h2>

Daniel Greenstein is university librarian for systemwide library
planning and scholarly information and director of the California
Digital Library (CDL). Before joining the CDL in May 2002, he
served for two and a half years as director of the Digital
Library Federation, during which time he conducted research for
this report. Mr. Greenstein was a founding director of the Arts
and Humanities Data Service in the United Kingdom, and founding
co-director of the Resource Discovery Network, a distributed
service whose mission is to enrich learning, research, and
cultural engagement by facilitating new levels of access to
high-quality Internet resources. 

<p>Suzanne E. Thorin is the Ruth Lilly University Dean of
University Libraries at Indiana University. From 1980 to 1996,
she served on the staff of the Library of Congress (LC). From
1992&shy;1996 she was the LC chief of staff and the associate
librarian. At LC, Thorin served as the official U.S.
representative, appointed by the White House, for the G-7
electronic libraries project, one of eleven G-7 pilot projects
for the Global Information Society. She was also responsible for
the National Digital Library Program.</p>

This report was born in the spirit of congenial collaboration
that so characterizes the Digital Library Federation (DLF). The
idea for the study took shape in a New York City steakhouse where
four DLF directors met to reflect on the new roles and
responsibilities that were emerging for their libraries as they
entered an increasingly networked digital age.<sup><a
href="#n1">1</a></sup> Realizing that lessons from the past were
easier and perhaps more predictive than prognostications about
the future, they suggested that a study of DLF member programs
would reveal the history, aims, organization, and immediate
challenges in their libraries. 

<p>The study progressed quickly, following the development of a
lengthy (104-question) survey that was received and completed
without complaint at DLF member institutions. We learned
subsequently that numerous hands had to be called into play to
supply the answers to the questions we posed. Once compiled, the
data provided a rich source of information that indicated the
very different developmental trajectories and experiences in DLF
institutions. Review by a slightly broader group of library
directors suggested that the study be extended to include the
case studies that are presented here.<sup><a
href="#n2">2</a></sup> These, they argued, would breathe the life
of human experience into otherwise dry, if informative,
statistical data. The research was destined from this point to
impose even more heavily on already overcrowded schedules that
were opened graciously and with the utmost concern for congenial
hospitality to accommodate the authors' site visits.</p>

<p>In addition to the support we received from the library
community, we acknowledge the assistance of the Center for Survey
Research at Indiana University, which produced, compiled, and
analyzed the data. With a Herculean effort, Doug McKinney,
Assistant to the Dean at Indiana, summarized the survey data and
offered numerous insights into their meaning. The case studies
benefited from the wisdom, experience, and gracious hospitality
of DLF colleagues too numerous to name at the California Digital
Library, Harvard University, New York University, Indiana
University, the University of Michigan, and the University of
Virginia. At the Council on Library and Information Resources
(CLIR), Kathlin Smith provided welcome encouragement and sound
editorial direction. Cassie Savage, of CLIR, and Shawny Taysom,
of Indiana University, ensured that the authors met deadlines and
stayed in touch through the course of the investigation. Despite
the best efforts of all the aforementioned, this report will
sadly be lacking in ways that can be attributed uniquely to its
authors.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

Digital libraries, once project based and largely autonomous
efforts, are maturing. They are finding value in cooperating with
other units on campus, and their services are being promoted in
the broader academic community. Many are obtaining core funding.
Although digital libraries have a long way to go before they
reach their full potential, there has been significant
development in the past decade. Nonetheless, referring to the
digital library generically masks the fact that digital libraries
exist in diverse forms and with quite different functions,
priorities, and aims. As individual programs have matured, each
has developed its own personality, reflecting the circumstances
of its birth, its environment, its caretakers, and its leaders.
This report draws on the results of a survey and case studies of
DLF members to reveal how these influences have molded a range of
organizational forms that we call the digital library. 

<p>Precisely because of the distinctive quality of the programs
surveyed, it may seem odd that we have chosen to title this
report "A Biography," rather than "Selected Biographies." Digital
libraries are likely to retain their distinctiveness even as they
become more deeply integrated and build upon commonly available
collections and services to meet users' needs. But it is worth
considering, as the authors do, where the developmental
trajectory will lead, and it is worth thinking about how we will
describe the body of information that is being made available for
research and teaching through the efforts of numerous
not-for-profit institutions. We have learned that users of
electronic resources do not care where their information comes
from, as long as it is authoritative and authentic. I suspect the
user will refer to this rich and growing body of information not
as a collection of individual efforts, but as one digital
library.</p>
