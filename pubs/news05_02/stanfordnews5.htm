<h3>Medieval and Modern Thought Text Digitization Project</h3>
 
<p>The goal of Stanford&#8217;s Medieval and Modern Thought (MMT) Text Digitization 
 Project is to digitize on an ongoing basis reference works, source 
 collections, and primary and secondary books in the broad area 
of medieval and modern thought. The Project&#8217;s main purpose is to 
fulfill researcher needs for searchable text in support of ongoing 
research. Also, reference books are being added to the collection, 
including bibliographies, manuscript catalogs, and biographical lists.
 Content is drawn from the collections of the Stanford University 
 Libraries and from other member libraries of the Research Library Cooperative 
 Program. Digitization work is being done in-house, and at the end of 
calendar year 2004, approximately 75,000 pages had been digitized and 
converted to searchable PDF. The Smart Family Foundation has provided 
financial support for the project through the Allan Morgan Standish Book
Fund, thus expanding the Fund&#8217;s traditional role of purchasing library
books to include also digitization of relevant materials.<br />

<h3>Parker on the Web</h3>
 
<p>Stanford is working with Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, to digitize 
 the more than 500 manuscripts in the Matthew Parker Library and 
 make them available through a rich and flexible online scholarly 
tool. We are near the end of an interim grant from the Mellon Foundation, 
 through which a prototype website (populated with all page images of
 two Parker manuscripts) and techniques for production-scale imaging 
 were developed. The full project, if funded, will require several years 
 of scanning and development. We expect that the platform to be developed 
 will be adaptable to other collections of manuscript materials.<br />

<h3><br />
 Stanford Historical Photograph Collection</h3>
 
<p>The Stanford Historical Photograph Collection is one of the Stanford University 
 Archives' major collections, consisting of some 16,000 photographs 
 from throughout Stanford's history, and covers architecture, events 
 and personalia (including a comprehensive set of images of the Stanford 
 family). Because of the collection's historical interest and high usage,
 SULAIR has had the desire to create high quality searchable digital 
surrogates for many years. This desire had been thwarted over the years 
by an insufficiently robust software and production infrastructure.<br />
 <br />
 Beginning in 2004, renewed efforts for this collection 
have begun to bear tangible fruit: the digitized version of the Stanford
 Historical Photograph Collection has now been released in a beta version
 of approximately 500 images, and is being served as a Luna Insight
image database. The production workflow put in place this year should
enable completion and publication of the entire collection within a
year or two.<br />

<h3><br />
 Visual Resources Collection: Art 2 (Asian Art)</h3>
 
<p>The Stanford Art Department Visual Resources Collection (VRC) has created 
 an initial (alpha) version of one of the major components of its 
slide library, the Art 2 collection, which focuses on Asian art. The 
collection will use Luna Insight software to deliver its images for 
classroom use. This is the first Insight image collection created at 
Stanford outside the Libraries by an "independent" collection owner. 
Its inclusion in the general Stanford collections will greatly increase 
the potential use of the collection, beyond just the primary clientele of
the Art Department; likewise, the suite of classroom presentation tools
available in Insight will better serve the faculty and students of that
department.<font color="#999999"><br />

<h3><br />
 Novels of the Irish-American West</h3>
 
<p>The Stanford Humanities Lab and SULAIR have jointly created a detailed
 author-title database and preliminary digital edition of largely
forgotten novels of the Irish-American West. The database includes
a large number of searchable fields specific to the situation of Irish-American
 writers and their work, including geographic locations and settings,
 biographical and bibliographic information, and abstracts. The full-text
 component consists of XML-encoded texts of primary works by Irish-American
 authors living west of the Mississippi, served via SULAIR's locally
developed full-text workhorse, which is a PAT-based engine for web delivery
of SGML.<br />

<h3><br />
 The Fairchild Chronicles</h3>
 
<p>A three-hour digital video documentary on Silicon Valley pioneer Fairchild
 Semiconductor is now available for sale. The Fairchild Chronicles
is based on SULAIR&#8217;s archival project &#8220;Silicon Genesis&#8221;, a series of
video oral histories of Silicon Valley. This is one of several Stanford
collections on the history of Silicon Valley. <br />
 <br />
 Through interviews with the people who made it happen, the
 Fairchild Chronicles tells the story of the company that invented
the integrated circuit, describing the events that spawned the first
generation of Silicon Valley technology companies. The DVD was co-produced
by Rob Walker from Walker Research Associates of Menlo Park, and Kevin
Bomberry from Panalta, Inc. of Palo Alto. It is available for $39.95
from Panalta, Inc. 250 Emerson Street, Palo Alto CA 94301. All revenues
go to SULAIR to continue chronicling the history of the semiconductor
industry.<font color="#999999"> <br />

<h3>GATT Digital Library</h3>
 
<p>With the support of an Institute for Museum and Library Services grant--and 
 in close collaboration with the World Trade Organization (WTO)-- SULAIR 
 has digitized and created an Internet presence for records of the WTO's 
 predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).<br />
 </p>
 
<p>The GATT Digital Library website provides access to over 30,000 public 
 documents and publications produced by this important international 
 governmental organization during 1947-1994 as well as a substantial 
array of interpretive resources related to the organization's history. 
The website enjoyed a "soft-launch" in early March for the purposes of 
load and functionality testing as well as user feedback. A formal public 
announcement is planned for April in joint communiqu&#233; with the WTO. As 
the SULAIR/WTO collaboration evolves, the two organizations intend to expand 
significantly the scope of GATT-related public content made available over
this site to include additional derestricted documents and archival materials.<br />

<h3>Lux</h3>
 
<p>SULAIR is pleased to announce that the first phase of development on Lux, 
a full text search engine for homogeneous collections of XML, is complete. 
The software is written in Java, and uses the Apache Group's Lucene library 
as its underlying search implementation. Originally created to support the 
full text and metadata searching capabilities of the GATT Digital Library 
(see above in Collections), Lux allows librarians to create a searchable index
from any collection of well-formed XML, without writing a line of Java. The
basic distribution includes Java libraries for searching Lux indexes, and
a J2EE web application, built using the Struts framework, for searching Lux
collections. SULAIR plans to use Lux to support the delivery of a variety 
of full-text collections. This coming summer, SULAIR plans to release the 
code for Lux to the open-source community, and we encourage our peers to use
and further develop the software.<br />

<h3>Find It @ Stanford University</h3>
 
<p>Stanford University Libraries &amp; Academic Information Resources (SULAIR) 
has completed implementation of the resource-linking technology SFX from Ex
Libris.&#160; SULAIR was one of the first institutions to implement the new Version
3 of SFX.&#160; Initial installation was in mid-December 2004, and even with the
subsequent two-week holiday closure, the target date of February 1, 2005
for the public roll-out of SFX was met.&#160; The implementation was achieved through
the joint work of staff from the Acquistions Department, the Digital Services
Group&#8217;s Systems Team, and Collections and Services.&#160; Shortly after the public
roll-out, SULAIR also joined the first group of institutions testing the
Google Scholar SFX pilot.<br />

<h3><font color="#000000"><br />
 Stanford Grokker</font></h3>
   
 
<p><font color="#000000">In the Fall of 2004, the Stanford University Libraries 
 and Academic Information Resources (SULAIR) teamed with Groxis 
 to provide a customized version of their Grokker tool for the Stanford 
 community. Grokker is an innovative research and information management 
 tool that simultaneously searches many data sources, and presents results
 in a topically organized, visual map. Already, nearly 2000 Stanford
 faculty, staff, and students have downloaded the Stanford Grokker
tool to their personal computers. Grokker is also available on public
computer clusters and library kiosks throughout Stanford. <br />
 <br />
 Grokker presents search results in a topically organized 
 visual map, rather than in the long list of results typically provided
 by most search engines. Grokker&#8217;s innovative mapping enables users
 to identify</font><font color="#000000"> quickly</font><font
 color="#000000"> and save relevant and valuable information, and to discover 
 relationships among results. Grokker provides a form of federated 
 searching by allowing users to search several resources simultaneously. 
 The publicly available version of Grokker searches the Web, Amazon, 
 and personal or shared hard drives.<br />
 <br />
 SULAIR staff have worked closely with Grokker to 
develop a customized Stanford Grokker that searches both publicly 
available resources and Stanford owned or licensed resources. The
current version of Stanford Grokker provides a single point of access
to Socrates (the Stanford library catalog), HighWire Press, Expanded
Academic ASAP, Academic Search Premier, IEEE Xplore, RLG Union Catalog,
the Library of Congress, and the Web. SULAIR and Groxis continue to
work together to add new features to Grokker and to expand the number 
 of research sources that Grokker can search.<br />

 The Sakai Project at Stanford</h3>
   
 
<p>Stanford University has joined forces with three other institutions, the
 University of Michigan, Indiana University and MIT, to develop the
 next generation of course management tools. This landmark venture,
called the Sakai Project, aims to create open-source course management
 tools and related software for the higher education community. It is
being launched with a grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation, with a
commitment of resources and adoption from the core institutions that will
 swiftly integrate and synchronize the educational software. <br />
 </p>
 
<p>Each of the partners in this consortium is contributing the work done 
 on internally developed course management systems to create a new 
 set of products that encompasses the best features of the individual 
efforts. The pre-integrated work products developed by the Sakai Project 
 will greatly reduce the implementation costs of one or more of these 
tools at any institution. By synchronizing efforts, the four institutions 
are able to deliver more value to their own campuses than any one would 
by working alone. In addition, dozens of colleges and universities have 
joined the Sakai Educational Partners Program. Active pilots of the Sakai 
software are underway at several of the schools, and many more plan to 
adopt Sakai in the coming year.<br />
 </p>
 
<p> The Sakai Project will provide Stanford with the next version of CourseWork,
 the popular course management system in use by thousands of Stanford
 faculty and students each quarter. In addition to all the features
CourseWork now offers, the new environment will include tools to support
project teams and other groups of people, and will have many new features
as well. The new version of CourseWork will be tested at Stanford in the
next academic year, as new features are developed, and will replace
the current version of CourseWork.<br />

<h3><font color="#000000">The LOCKSS Program</font></h3>
   
 
<p><font color="#000000">The LOCKSS Program is continuing to build on its 
 successes while looking to the future. A growing number of institutions 
 are running LOCKSS machines with an increasing number of titles 
available. New software is released approximately once every six 
weeks. The system is a proven viable solution to addressing the risk 
of libraries losing their ability to own, access and preserve digital 
 content. A vested community of partners is starting to form, and an 
infrastructure being built that can sustain and grow the program.<font

 </a></font></p>
   
 
<p>In response to many requests for a simple demonstration of the capabilities 
of the LOCKSS system, we published the LOCKSS Winter 2005 Card. The Card contained
a movie of the LOCKSS team, an excel spreadsheet, LOCKSS java software, and
many other file formats.&#160; The card was available during February and March.
It has now disappeared from the web. Fortunately, most of the LOCKSS machines
around the world collected and preserved it. The readers at these institutions
have perpetual access to this content. This simple exercise demonstrates
the basic capabilities of the LOCKSS system:<br />
 &#183; Content remains visible after it disappears from the 
publisher<br />
 &#183; Access to preserved content is transparent - the Card 
will be visible via LOCKSS machines around the world at its original URL.<br />
 &#183; The system is format agnostic - the Card includes a
wide range of formats (HTML, PDF, Quicktime Movie, Microsoft Excel, gif,
JPEG, XML, Java source, Java JAR files)<font color="#000000"><br />
 </font></p>
   
<p><font color="#000000">The LOCKSS system has designed and tested an initial 
 implementation of format migration for Web content that is transparent 
 to readers, building on the content negotiation capabilities of HTTP. 
 This capability was demonstrated at a NARA workshop, November 2004, 
 and appears to be the first time that a production digital preservation 
 system has demonstrated transparent format migration of live content 
 collected from the Web for end users. <a target="_blank"

<p><font color="#000000">The LOCKSS Alliance is a membership organization 
 of those committed to advancing the LOCKSS Program to its next stage 
 of evolution. The LOCKSS Alliance Board is finalizing details about 
 membership fees, benefits and services, as well as governance and organization.
 The goal is to create a vibrant community of LOCKSS users that will
 share program costs and take full advantage of member benefits, including
 the leverage that a group of like-minded institutions can have on the
 marketplace. <br />

<h3><br />
 High-Capacity, Standards-Based Production-Repository-Delivery Workflow</h3>
   
 
<p>In connection with work on the Stanford Historical Photograph Collection, 
 created and digitized at Stanford and delivered via Luna Insight (see above, 
 under Collections), we have developed a high-capacity, standards-driven production
 workflow, which has made possible the beta release of this complex collection,
 and which will become the basis for at least one predictable and dependable
 pipeline for creation of large image databases at Stanford in the future.&#160;
 While the workflow from production to preservation to delivery is far from
 seamless, we have been striving to make any necessary seams as smooth as
possible. The basic workflow and associated technologies are these:</p>
 <ul>

<li>A generalized, standards-based SULAIR metadata set for descriptive (Dublin Core-based), technical and administrative metadata, supported by the use of METS packaging<br />

</li><li>A proprietary scanning and quality-control workflow program, which collects and binds this SULAIR standard metadata and image data at capture time, and stores it as database objects
</li><li>A script which ingests archival units of these metadata and images into the Stanford Digital Repository<br />
</li><li>A script which exports these archival units from the Repository as XML METS packages containing MODS-encoded descriptive metadata for denoting the collections and the items within them, as well as mapping for the associated image files.&#160; The metadata also include a durable Repository  ID to enable bi-directional interoperability between the Repository and the delivery system
</li><li>An XSL transformation which extracts the metadata from  selected descriptive and technical fields from each object and inserts it  as relational table data into a proprietary (Insight-aware) environment for further processing and delivery
</li>

 </ul>

<p>Although this complex workflow is currently tailored for a particular
set of metadata elements describing a particular collection, as well as
for particular capture, repository and delivery systems, we are working
to make it generalizable for different collections described with different
subsets of our descriptive metadata set, and for different capture processes
and workflows.&#160; A key component of the process is its ability to move data
smoothly from a proprietary capture system to a proprietary delivery system
-- and it is the standards-based middle portion of the process that makes
this possible.<br />
 <br />
 </p>
<h3>Stanford HighWire Update</h3>
   
 In 2005, HighWire Press&#174;, Stanford&#8217;s electronic journal hosting service
for the scholarly publishing community, celebrated its tenth anniversary.
<br />
<br />
As of April 2005, HighWire assists in the online production of 850 journals.
From the start, HighWire worked with societies focused on research in the
life sciences and medicine, the kind of journals that continue to be among
the highest-impact titles. Starting in 2004, through a series of new publishing
partnerships, HighWire has expanded its scope to include over 400 Social
Science and Humanities journals. Within this broader context, HighWire continues
to explore the best ways to support the provision of scholarly information
and the scientific communication process.<br />
<br />
In early 2005, HighWire helped create and launch GeoScience World, a new
project by a group of leading geoscientific organizations, which offers a
comprehensive Internet resource portal for research and communications in
the geosciences.<br />
<br />
For its exemplary work in online hosting and service, HighWire was recipient
of the 2003 Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)
Award for "Service to Not-for-Profit Publishing&#8221;. <br />
<br />
HighWire doesn&#8217;t own or sell the content hosted on its website, but they
do support librarian colleagues in other ways: helping their society partners
&#8216;hear&#8217; the librarian's voice on current issues, as well as enabling and encouraging
publishers to free-up back issues. With nearly 850,000 free articles and
counting, HighWire continues to be the largest repository of free full-text
science available online. <br />
<br />
There are a number of free searching and alerting services for end-users,
including a customized home page, with user-selected links to &#8220;my favorite
journals&#8221; and &#8220;my alerts&#8221;; and a 55,000-topic list of taxonomy categories
establishing subject links directly to individual articles. With its portal,
HighWire offers a series of librarian tools to tackle some common management
tasks, such as multi-journal usage reports &#8211; in both detailed, and COUNTER
compliant formats &#8211; and IP address maintenance across publishers. <br />
<br />
Some of the HighWire-affiliated publishers are participating in a program
called &#8220;Shop for Journals&#8221;, where librarians can quickly find out how much
a subscription will cost for their type of institution. In addition, there
is now a simple FTP site where metadata (headers and abstracts) can be downloaded
to registered users (the same feed as is provided to PubMed) to assist in
searching. And, there is a feature on the &#8220;For Institutions&#8221; section of the
HighWire website which makes looking up ISSN numbers, publisher addresses,
and other FAQ&#8217;s easy for librarians.<br />

<h3>Remote Hosting of Local Collections Pilot</h3>
     
 
<p>SULAIR has been working with ARTstor to deliver one of its image collections, 
 Antiquarian Maps of Africa, via the ARTstor interface. This collection 
 is currently available worldwide from Stanford via the Luna Insight 
 interface; the ARTstor pilot, when complete, will offer the same collection 
 to Stanford users among its rich art resources.<br />
 <br />
 While we are still far from the goal of complete image collection
 interoperability with this pilot project, ARTstor does offer one
possible solution to the problem, and Stanford has been a participant
in this ARTstor initiative.<font color="#000000"><font

<h3>NDIIPP Award to Archive Geospatial Data Given to SUL and UCSB</h3>
 
<p><br />
 The Library of Congress has selected Stanford and the University
 of California, Santa Barbara to develop one of eight major national
initiatives for digital information preservation. The Stanford/UCSB
team will form a National Geospatial Digital Archive (NGDA) with the
goal of designing an infrastructure to collect and provide for long-term
preservation of digital materials across the spectrum of geographic formats.
The born-digital materials to be collected and preserved will range from
LANDSAT imagery to other cartographic content from university, corporate
and government resources, as well as Web sites. The Repository will preserve
content vital for the study of history, science, environmental policy,
urban and population studies, census construction and analysis, and other
fields requiring U.S. geospatial information.<br />
 <br />
 Once established, the Archive will allow Stanford Library staff 
 to offer archival solutions to other organizations and individuals that
 have produced important digital geographical resources considered to be
 at risk. The University of Washington, the California Spatial Information 
 Library, and noted collector and digital publisher David Rumsey are 
among those that have agreed to contribute digital resources to the Archives.<br />
 <br />
 The Library of Congress announced the award of nearly $3M to
 the Stanford/UCSB partnership in Washington on 30 September, 2004,
culminating a nearly two-year effort to begin putting in place a series
of cooperative networks of digital repositories. Julie Sweetkind-Singer,
head of the Branner Earth Sciences Library and Map Collections and GIS/map
librarian, will be the lead for the Stanford team, which will include up
to a dozen individuals at any time during the three-year project.<font

<h3>Digital Services Group</h3>
   
 
<p>Recognizing the ongoing need to address its readiness for the digital
future, Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources
(SULAIR) reorganized to create the Digital services Group (DSG). The DSG
operates the technology infrastructure for the libraries as well as for services
directly used by the Stanford community. It also produces and supports applications
 for libraries and instructional settings. DSG projects build upon
purchased systems, locally developed tools, and increasingly, public
domain software. In these areas, it provides significant local integration
 and enhancement, plus ongoing support of these applications and their
 technical environments. <br />
 <br />
 Specifically, the Digital Services Group supports enterprise
 applications; digital library projects for capture, description,
storage, organization and access to information; Unicorn and the related
library management tools; the nascent Stanford Digital Repository;
and various academic applications. The DSG team is experienced in the
implementation, integration and enhancement of purchased systems in
the library realm, adding value to the packages for use at Stanford.
The same is expected to be true with incoming open-source applications
such as DSpace, Greenstone, and ePortfolio. <br />
 <br />
 Moving forward, the DSG has the following organizational
goals:</p>

 <ul>
 
<li>Build the technology infrastructure and collections
 that will comprise the digital library of the future.

</li><li>Stimulate and focus innovation and assessment: in
 context, with goals and evaluation processes

</li><li>Develop economies of scope and scale: consolidate 
 expertise and projects; eliminate redundancy, enhance shared expertise
 and multi-use technologies and methodologies; 

</li><li>Identify total cost and resources needed for development 
 and ongoing support of digital collections

 </li><li>Develop clear and supportable product and project 
 life cycles

 </li><li>Provide decision-making data and analysis to inform
 decisions and priorities.

 </li><li>Provide leadership and stimulus in the Stanford 
technology community to develop new capabilities and technologies; inform
 technology directions and frameworks<a target="_blank"

<h2>The Stanford Center for Excellence in the Knowledge Enterprise</h2>
   
 
<p>This partnership between Sun Microsystems and Stanford University Libraries
 and Academic Information Resources (SULAIR) represents Sun&#8217;s and
SULAIR&#8217;s continued commitment to innovation, collaboration with leading
academic institutions, and the pursuit of new advances in networked
education and federated information.<br />
 <br />
 The overall objectives of the Center of Excellence (CoE)
are to:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Create best practices and models for the preservation 
 and dissemination of information in academic research institutions;
 </li>
 <li>Lead both academia and the publishing industry in
 creatively addressing the related issues of access and preservation; 
 </li>
 <li>Establish norms for institutional output storage
 policies and practices by example.
 </li>
</ul>

 <p>SULAIR is in the business of selecting, collecting, describing, 
 disseminating, publishing, archiving and making accessible information 
 for teaching, learning, and research. The Center of Excellence will 
 further the state of the art in each of these functions in the digital 
 environment. Specifically, we are deeply and fundamentally interested 
in:</p>
 
<ul>
 <li>The technology of capture, description, delivery,
 storage and preservation of information on a massive scale; </li>
 
<li>Growing the market within the academic industry 
for integrated hardware and software solutions suitable for local digital
 repositories, mirroring agreements, interoperating repositories, course
 management systems, distributed persistent digital caches, etc.; </li>

 <li> Creating and maintaining new kinds of communities 
 among scholars in academic publishing.<br />
