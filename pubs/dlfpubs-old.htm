A Survey of Digital Library Aggregation Services</i></a> <br />Martha L. Brogan.  
(December 2003)</b>
<br /><br />
This report, commissioned by the DLF, provides an overview of a diverse set of more than thirty digital library aggregation services, organizes them into functional clusters, and then evaluates them more fully from the perspective of an informed user. Most of the services under review rely wholly or partially on the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI-PMH).   Each service is annotated with its organizational affiliation, subject coverage, function, audience, status, and size. Critical issues surrounding each of these elements are presented in order to provide the reader with an appreciation of the nuances inherent in seemingly straightforward factual information, such as "audience" or "size."

<i>Dimensions and Use of the Scholarly Information Environment.</i></a> 
(November 2002)</b>
<br /><br />We know from anecdotal evidence that users' expectations of
libraries are changing as they find more information directly
from the Web, but anecdotes are an insufficient basis for  
developing new library services. DLF and CLIR 
commissioned Outsell, Inc. to conduct a 
large-scale study to give us a much more reliable picture of user behaviors.  
Published here are the 
659 data tables that record the responses to 35 groups of questions asked of 3,200  
undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members from academic institutions 
ranging from small liberal arts colleges to the largest public and private research universities. [Formats: PDF; HTML; MS Excel]

<br /><br />
Digital libraries, once project-based and largely autonomous efforts, are maturing. As individual programs have grown, each has developed its own personality, reflecting the circumstances of its creation and environment, and its leadership. This report from CLIR and the DLF draws on the results of a survey and case studies of DLF members to reveal how these influences have molded a range of organizational forms that we call the digital library. The report is written by Daniel Greenstein and Suzanne Thorin. Greenstein, formerly the director of the DLF, is now university librarian and director of the California Digital Library. Thorin is the dean of university libraries at Indiana University.  Section one of the report examines three stages of digital library growth: the young digital library, the maturing digital library, and the adult digital library. Section two of the report presents case studies of digital library development at six institutions.  [Formats: PDF; HTML; print]

<br /><br />
Research libraries are taking on a range of new roles in the digital age as they become more deeply engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge. While some of these roles are extensions of traditional library activity, others are largely new. Wendy Lougee, university librarian at the University of Minnesota, explores some of these emerging functions in this report. Lougee includes several examples of how some libraries and library organizations are forging new services in areas of collection development, information access, and user services; she also touches briefly on the continued importance of library as place. In addition, she suggests where new roles might emerge. In the section on information access, for example, she notes the potential for libraries to contribute to the development of the Semantic Web, which aims to develop languages for expressing information in a form that machines can process, and which therefore can be searched more accurately and efficiently. She writes, "Designing the Semantic Web will require a mix of skills, and librarians have the potential to contribute significantly to this effort." She also notes that there is a potential role for the library in certifying the authenticity and provenance of content on the Semantic Web.

National Strategy for Preservation: Issues in Digital Media Archiving.</i></a></i> 
(April 2002).</b>
<br /><br />In December 2000, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds to the Library 
of Congress (LC) to spearhead an effort to develop a national strategy for the preservation of digital information. Understanding that the task cannot be accomplished by any one organization, Congress wrote into the appropriations language a requirement that LC work with other federal, scholarly, and nonprofit organizations to discuss the problem and produce a plan. The staff of the Library of Congress immediately scheduled a series of conversations with representatives from the technology, business, entertainment, academic, legal, archival, and library communities. LC asked CLIR to commission background papers for these sessions and to summarize the meetings. The resulting papers, along with an integrative essay by Amy Friedlander, are presented in this document. [Formats: ]</p>

and Useability Assessment. Library Practices and Concerns.</a></i>
Denise Troll Covey. (January 2002) </b>

<br /><br />This report offers a survey
of the methods that are being deployed at leading digital
libraries to assess the use and usability of their online
collections and services. Focusing on 24 DLF member libraries, the study's 
author, Distinguished DLF Fellow Denise Troll Covey, conducted numerous interviews with
library professionals who are engaged in assessment. The report
describes the application, strengths, and weaknesses of
assessment techniques that include surveys, focus groups, user
protocols, and transaction log analysis. Covey's work is also an
essential methodological guidebook. For each method that she
covers, she is careful to supply a definition, explain why and
how libraries use the method, what they do with the results, and
what problems they encounter. The report includes an extensive
bibliography on more detailed methodological information, and
descriptions of assessment instruments that have proved
particularly effective. [Formats: ]</p>

<br /><br />
As the scholarly information environment changes, so do the needs, expectations,
and behaviors of users. Assessing and responding to those changes
is essential for the academic library so that it may continue in
support of the scholarly mission. The authors of this report have
formally examined how humanities scholars conduct and collate
their research. The study was based on a small sample of
scholars; nonetheless, the results are powerfully suggestive of
ways in which academic libraries can adapt to and develop in a
rapidly changing environment. In particular, the findings
emphasize how important it is for libraries to chart their
evolutionary course in close consultation with scholarly user
communities. This study results from the fruitful
cross-fertilization between the scholar concerned with aspects of
information science and the librarian concerned with delivering
operational information services. [Formats: ]</p>

<br /><br />
In February 2001, CLIR and the
National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage (NINCH)
convened a meeting to discuss how museums and libraries are
building digital collections and what business models are
available to sustain them. A group of museum and library senior
executives met with business and legal experts, technologists,
and funders to discuss the challenges that cultural institutions
face when putting collections online and to identify models for
sustainability that support the core missions without
contravening the internal cultures of nonprofit entities. Using
examples of six enterprises -- JSTOR, HighWire Press, The
International Center for Photography and George Eastman House,
Questia Media, Inc., Art Museum Network, and Fathom -- the report
illustrates the differing approaches being used to extend the
reach of collections and services online.  [Formats: ]</p>

<br /><br />This
report is the second in a series commissioned by the DLF to
identify and review digital collection development strategies and
practices. It provides an in-depth look at how several research
libraries select, license, present, and support the use of
commercial online materials. Uncovering a variety of practices,
author Timothy Jewell identifies those that are proving to be
most effective integrating commercial online materials into
library collections. He includes a decision tool that emphasizes
and supports strategic planning, and encourages careful
consideration of how libraries' functions and professional staff
are organized. He also supplies a reference tool, citing working
papers and operational guidelines that libraries rely on but
rarely "publish." Finally, the author frames an important and
practical development agenda by encouraging libraries to
collaborate in designing information systems capable of
organizing the detailed and often dynamic information they need
to maintain about their commercial holdings. [Formats: ]</p>

Sustainable Collections of Free Third-Party Web Resources</i>.</a>
Louis Pitschmann. (June 2001)</b>

<br /><br /> This report is the first in a
series commissioned by the DLF to identify and review digital
collection development strategies and practices. The report
identifies and synthesizes existing practices used in developing
collections of free third-party Internet resources that support
higher education and research. A review of these practices and
the projects they support confirms that developing collections of
free Web resources is a process that requires its own set of
practices, policies, and organizational models. Where possible,
the report recommends those practices, policies, and models that
have proved to be particularly effective in terms of
sustainability, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and
applicability to their stated purpose. The report outlines the
similarities and differences between print and free Web resources
and describes how the nature and complexity of free Web resources
comply with or challenge traditional library practices and
services pertaining to analog collections.  [Formats: ]</p>
