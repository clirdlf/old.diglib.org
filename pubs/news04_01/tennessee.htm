<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Albert
&ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; Roth Photograph Collection</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Albert
&ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; Roth collection contains some of the finest
images taken of the Great Smoky Mountains region in the early to
mid-twentieth century. Mr. Roth is recognized as one of the most
prolific early photographers of the Great Smoky Mountains'
Greenbrier and Mount Le Conte sections. The photographs provide a
significant level of insight into the pioneer way of life as well
as the early stages in the creation of the Great Smoky Mountain
National Park. The collection consists of 1200 digital images
that can be assessed via DLXS image and bib classes. OAI records
are available for harvesting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>The Flora of
Tennessee</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The flora
digitization project is an initiative to add plant images to the
herbarium&rsquo;s existing distribution maps of the vascular
plants of Tennessee. The project began with a grant from The
University of Tennessee Digital Library Center (DLC). To date,
the DLC has provided ca. 1500 digital images that are now
available for viewing. In addition, the DLC created and will be
archiving digital master images for the future needs of the
Herbarium, as the technology evolves.</p>

in the Tennessee Fungal Herbarium</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>UT Scientists have
been gathering, studying, and describing a collection of over
60,000 specimens in the UT Fungal Herbarium. This collection is
especially strong in specimens from the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park. About 900 "type" specimens used to establish new
species were selected and have been digitized by the Digital
Library Center.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Tennessee
Documentary History, 1796-1850</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The collection
contains documents and images relating to the history of
antebellum Tennessee. With financial support from the Institute
of Museum and Library Services, over the course of two years the
University of Tennessee Libraries has built a free on-line
website with a searchable database. The primary audience for TDH
is K-12 teachers of Tennessee history, who can download primary
materials for classroom instruction; however, the content is
suitable for academic scholars and general researchers as well.
The documents were marked up using TEI-Lite and indexing and
access was built using a customized version of DLXS textclass.
OAI records are available for harvesting.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Virtual
Reference Services</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>With use of
Question Point software, the Reference department is on its
second generation of virtual reference services. The first began
in August 2001, when the Reference department debuted its live
reference service. Using Live Person software, we gradually
increased our hours over the year and during Spring semester set
up a central service point for monitoring phone, e-mail, and chat
reference service. In June 2003, The Reference Department began
participating in a consortial subscription to Question Point.</p>

<b>Open Archives Initiative (OAI)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Library
established an OAI data provider service in early 2002. This
service was initially developed using a Php/MySQL solution that
also included a web-based form for data entry of Dublin Core. In
2003, OAI data provider service was assumed by DLXS as the new
release provides built-in, OAI data provider/broker
functionality. This service currently makes available 2336
records, providing public access to all digital library
objects.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Migrated to Ex
Libris Integrated Library System</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The library is
currently nearing the end of a 6-month migration schedule to
deploy Ex Libris&rsquo; Aleph library system. The new system will
replace epixtech&rsquo;s Horizon system.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>MetaLib
Development</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Metalib
software suite was purchased from Ex Libris. Metalib will serve
as UTK Libraries&rsquo; scholarly portal, and also includes SFX,
which uses the OpenURL standard to create dynamic links between
information resources and services. The SFX portion of Metalib
went live in Fall 2002.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Library
Software System Update</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Performed DLXS
system update to release 10 in the Spring 2003. DLXS is the
primary system used for access and delivery of locally created
digital collections.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Development
(pre-production) Server</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A development
server was also purchased in Spring 2003 to provide an
update/upgrade environment for the DLXS system. The primary
purpose for establishing the development server was to minimize
system down-time on the production server due to system updates.
All system updates are now performed on the development server
first allowing time to fine-tune and tweak the software before
transferring the updates to the production environment.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Archival Storage
Server</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In Spring 2003, the
Digital Library Center acquired a new server with 2-terabytes of
storage capacity to provide archival storage of digital masters.
This storage server is being used to store master metadata files,
uncompressed binary, and the documentation associated with
digital projects.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Tape Backup
System Upgrade</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A new magnetic tape
backup system was purchased in 2002 to service the fast-growing
amount of digital content. The new system provides storage
capacity measured in Terabytes.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Library
Metrics</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A system was
developed in Summer 2003 to capture and track digital collection
use. This metric-tracking tool compiles the number of queries and
the number of users for each collection, each class, and the
entire library, providing daily, weekly and monthly totals.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Library
Programmer (1 FTE)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>With the addition
of a professional programmer in December 2002, the digital
library now has three full-time staff (Digital Initiatives
Librarian and Metadata Librarian) who are devoted primarily to
digital library development.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><a id="sec2" name="sec2"></a><b><span

Projects</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Blount County
Public Library (BCPL) Collaborative.<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Digital Library
Center is serving in a consulting role to assist BCPL in the
development of a digital library project that will provide a
collection of historic images. The project is developing as a
pilot for the Tennessee Electronic Library Preserve and Share
Project. Currently, BCPL is working to secure the rights to
freely distribute the images and also have begun a formal
selection process that will eventually include K-12
educators.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>History of Women
at the University of Tennessee</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>This is a joint
project with the Women&rsquo;s Studies Program. Approximately
2,000 items related to the Women's Study Program, the UT
Commission for Women, and prominent women associated with UT have
been selected for digitization and will be added to the UT
Digital Library. Historical materials about the first women to
attend UT and photographs of UT women students, staff and faculty
will be gathered from the University Archives and other
repositories. The selection process was recently completed and
scanning work is underway.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>David Van Vactor
Collection</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>David Van Vactor
was the conductor of the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra for 25
years and the founder of the UT School of Music. This is a joint
project with the Music Library and will make available sound
recordings from the Music Department and the Knoxville Symphony
produced from 1942 through 1979 and parts of the original music
manuscripts, opening a window for the public and scholars alike
on Knoxville's cultural history.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>WPA/TVA
Photographs</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In preparation for
a Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) dam construction in the
1930&rsquo;s, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) provided
archaeological workers to systematically photograph and document
the many prehistoric sites along the river before flooding from
dam construction occurred. The resulting collection consists of
approximately 15,000 photos that are permanently curated by the
Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee, the
William S Webb Museum at the University of Kentucky, and the
Alabama Museum of Natural History at the University of Alabama.
With funding provided by the Institute of Library and Museum
Services (IMLS), this project is currently digitizing 7500 of the
photographs, creating standardized metadata, and building an
online service for search and retrieval of images from the
collection.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>National Digital
Library for the Legacy of the Manhattan Project</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Manhattan
Project, the massive scientific effort to produce the first
atomic bomb during World War II, brought the United States into
the nuclear age. The Library is collaborating with the Department
of Energy&rsquo;s Office of Scientific and Technical Information
(OSTI), Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL), and the American
Museum of Science and Energy (AMSE) to carry out the section,
digitization, and web presentation of 2,000 documents and images
from the Manhattan project.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Use-Based
Selection for Digital Monographs</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The goal of this
project is to add full-text links to the catalog for pre-1923
monographs owned by the University of Tennessee Libraries. Titles
with at least five circulations in the past five years will be
searched in OCLC&rsquo;s WorldCat to identify those already in
digital form. Remaining titles will be high priorities for
digitization. This will make high use and often-fragile
monographs more accessible to students, faculty, staff, and the
public. Monographs published prior to 1923 are in the public
domain and can be duplicated freely and distributed without the
complicated concerns of copyright ownership.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>The Tennessee
Electronic Library Preserve and Share Tennessee Culture
Initiative</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Digital Library
Center will host a statewide digital initiative that provides an
integrated resource discovery method for digital collections and
content from around the state. This statewide project will offer
Tennessee cultural heritage resources for the K-12 community and
citizens of the state.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Institutional
Repository Exploration</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The digital library
is collaborating with UT SunSite to develop a DSpace test
implementation, allowing the campus community to further explore
institutional repositories.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>UT Scholars
Archive</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>This is a first
attempt to gather cost data on digitizing a journal, the
<i>Journal of Economic Issues</i> (JEI).  Issues from 2000-2001
are now digitized. We are working on a methodology for gathering
use statistics. The larger vision is to digitize half a dozen
journals and make them available through open access. This would
create the foundation for a scholars&rsquo; archive and gives the
DLC baseline information about the technical processes of
digitizing journals.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Scholarly
Publishing &amp; the Common Good Symposium</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>On September 25-26,
2002 the Libraries hosted <i>Scholarly Publishing &amp; the
Common Good: Changing Our Culture</i> , a symposium for the UT
academic community. The conference addressed issues related to
reasons for declining access to scholarly information; ways
faculty choices affect the cost of publications, ways that the

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The E-Forum Series
features programs for the university community on the convergence
of scholarly communications and emerging technology. Started in
1996 following a UT scholarly publishing conference,
<i>Professors and Publishing in the Electronic Academy</i>, the
E-Forum Series presents both national and local speakers. Among
speakers in the last two years were Sarah Thomas (Cornell
University) on the ARL Portals project; Peter Boyce (American
Astronomical Association) on scholarly association publishing
vision; Paula Kaufman (University of Illinois) on changes in
scholarly communications; Abby Smith (CLIR) on building research
collections in the digital age; Mark Beatty (University of
Wisconsin) on electronic books; and Hillary Nunn (University of

</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>John Price Wilkin,
Associate Director for Digital Library Services at the University
of Michigan met with the Steering Committee on September 13, 2002
to discuss digital issues.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><a id="sec3" name="sec3"></a><b><span
style='font-size:16.0pt'>III. Specific Digital Library
Challenges</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>DLC goals include
developing a more versatile technical infrastructure to support
digital collections, continuing the systematic development of
digital content, making the DLC and its mission more visible, and
documenting digital library procedures and practices. The DLC
Steering Committee held a planning retreat in March 2003. We
noted that the strategy for selection of initial projects worked
well to involve many in the university community. As the projects
got underway, we discovered that some of the project proposers
held different expectations from those of the librarians, in
terms of how data would be managed, where content would reside,
and length of commitment to the project. Hiring a metadata
librarian and DLC programmer helped to relieve the workload of
librarians and staff who had added digital projects to already
full agendas. We lacked technical leadership, a common problem
with emerging digital libraries. During the retreat we drafted a
mission statement: &ldquo;The Digital Library Center creates and
provides durable access to and preservation of unique and
valuable collections.&rdquo; We identified three areas for
specific attention: leadership, documentation, and
integration.<br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>
<b>Leadership</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>As digital library
projects mature at the University of Tennessee, the need for a
full-time leader of the Digital Library Center has become
apparent to the Steering Committee. Although integration of
functions and projects into existing library units is the
long-term goal, the Digital Library Center focus on developmental
work requires sustained attention. The Steering Committee is
currently working on a position description.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Documentation of
policies, procedures, public information</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A subcommittee of
the Steering Committee used the IMLS <i>A Framework of Guidance
for Building Good Digital Collections</i>, Lou Pittschman&rsquo;s
<i>Building Sustainable Collections of Free Third-Party Web
Resources</i>, and Abby Smith&rsquo;s <i>Strategies for Building
Digitized Collections</i> to draft a <i>Digital Collections
Management Policy</i>. The UT document addresses content,
objects, metadata and access. Considerable work is yet to be done
in converting the goal-based approach into sustainable policies
and procedures that those involved with digitizing local
resources can use for standards. We must determine criteria for
digital preservation and develop standards as well as processes
for selection and production.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Integration of
DLC projects into user services <br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>From selection of
resources for digitization to provision of access to digital
materials, we are challenged to incorporate DLC projects into the
awareness of library staff and users. Subject librarians will
need criteria for selecting items to digitize. We must determine
criteria for digital preservation and develop standards as well
as processes for selection and production. We want to move beyond
a collection of web links to access from many points, such as the
library catalog, commercial databases, web searches, etc. where
users begin their research. From a technical standpoint we hope
to integrate metadata skills beyond the cataloging department,
creating templates on which users can submit their own metadata.
We hope to take advantage of sophisticated linking systems that
will draw locally digitized materials into search results.
Through our projects we are gaining valuable knowledge about
relative cost, efficiency, user behavior, and communicating with
subject experts about content.</p>
