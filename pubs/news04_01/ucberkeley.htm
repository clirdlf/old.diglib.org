Collections</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The UCB Library has
created or collaborated in the creation of nearly 200 collections
of digital content. An inventory of these collections, with brief
descriptions and links to the collections themselves, is
maintained by the Digital Publishing Group (DPG), a unit of the
Library Systems Office. It is available on the DPG Web site at
the following URL:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Remote
access</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The UC Berkeley
Library provides a proxy service by means of which members of the
UC Berkeley community can access licensed content from off-campus
locations. Users authenticate using either their library card
number and a PIN, or their CalNet ID and passphrase. CalNet
authentication is the campus standard for Web applications and
uses the UCB Authentication Web Server, a Kerberos-based service
developed and maintained by the Systems and Network Security
group. The Library&rsquo;s proxy service is heavily used,
handling several million documents per month.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>GenDL<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The UC Berkeley
Library began implementing GenDL, its digital library support
architecture and system, in conjunction with the DLF sponsored
<i>Making of America II</i> initiative on which it was the lead
institution. This initiative developed the first standard
encoding for library digital objects (the MOA2.DTD) against which
the library could develop such a suite of digital library tools. 
Now that the METS schema, which builds on the MOA2 work, has
superseded the MOA2.DTD, the UC Berkeley Library has been working
to convert its MOA2-based tool suite to produce and present METS
objects. It has also been enhancing GenDL in ways that are
independent of the core encoding standard.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The GenDL tool
suite consists of 4 components:  GenDB, for gathering the raw
structural, descriptive and administrative metadata pertaining to
digital materials, GenX for creating standards-based digital
objects from the raw metadata, GenSearch for searching the
library&rsquo;s repository of digital objects, and GenView for
viewing and navigating the library&rsquo;s digital objects.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>As first
implemented, GenDB was built on MS Access, and the Library
Systems Office produced a separate Access-based GenDB database
for each digitizing project and project participant. Over the
past 2 years the Library Systems Office has worked to implement a
version of GenDB with a centralized database, and an intuitive
and highly configurable Web interface. This work is now
substantially complete, and the OAC administered California
Cultures project is actively using the new version of GenDB. The
University of California History Digital Archives, and
Environmental Design Archives will begin using this new tool over
the next couple of weeks. As Finding Aid support is added, and
project management features are improved, WebGenDB is expected to
support all UC Berkeley digitizing projects. WebGenDB/GenDB is
largely neutral with respect to encoding standards. However it
has also been adjusted better to support METS, MODS and MIX
output now that these are emerging as the primary standards for
target encodings.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>GenX, which
extracts the raw metadata from the GenDB database to produce
standards-based digital objects, previously produced MOA2
objects. A recently revised version of GenX now produces METS
objects, with MODS encoded descriptive metadata, and MIX encoded
image technical metadata. The new GenX cannot be finalized,
however, until appropriate schemas for technical metadata and
rights metadata emerge and/or mature.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>GenSearch is the
least developed component of the Library&rsquo;s tool suite. The
Library Systems Office has performed fairly extensive testing of
an XML database (Tamino) as a possible support for digital
library searching functions. However Tamino&rsquo;s support for
XML Schema in general, and METS and MODS in particular, is
currently immature and requires that the schemas be rewritten to
be loaded. Recent GenSearch research has focused on Cheshire II,
and the forthcoming Cheshire III.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>GenView has
provided library patrons with the ability to view MOA2 objects
since the conclusion of the MOA2 initiative. A new version of
GenView recently put into production supports METS objects as
well as MOA2 objects. Library Systems staff members have also
been working substantially to redesign the GenView interface to
make it more intuitive and user friendly. It will begin
implementing these enhancements in the very near future.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>XML Search
Tools</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>With the increase
in number of digital collections hosted by the UCB library,
providing our patrons with a reliable and efficient search tool
has become more important. It has also been essential to find one
compatible with the METS standard now used to describe objects'
technical, administrative, and descriptive metadata. The SAG XML
database Tamino was tested for the purpose, but its inability to
handle the full METS schema without modifications prompted us to
look at other products, including Cheshire II, an XML search
engine developed at UCB&rsquo;s School of Information Management
and Information Management and Systems by Ray Larson.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Tests performed to
date include the indexing of a million MODS records, which showed
a excellent performance for retrievals. The user interface API
made it easy to create a web search page. Compatibility with METS
was also good. Particularly interesting is Cheshire's support of
both Boolean and probabilistic "best match" ranked searching and
browsing. Unicode support is not available yet in Cheshire II,
but it is expected in the next release, Cheshire III, which is
currently under development. Additional information can be found
at the Cheshire II Web site.<br />

</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Digital
Publishing Group (DPG) manages and provides technical and other
forms of support for a wide variety of UC Berkeley&rsquo;s
digital publishing projects. The DPG maintains an alphabetical
list with brief descriptions of current projects at the following

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>LOCKSS at
Berkeley</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The UC Berkeley
Library is participating as a tester for Stanford
University&rsquo;s LOCKSS system. LOCKSS stands for "Lots of
Copies Keep Stuff Safe&rdquo; and the goal of the project is to
create low-cost, persistent digital caches of authoritative
versions of Web-delivered content. The LOCKSS software enables
institutions to locally collect and archive content, while
enforcing the publishers&rsquo; access control systems and
without harming their business models. The accuracy and
completeness of individual LOCKSS caches are assured through a
peer-to-peer polling system which is both robust and secure.
LOCKSS replicas cooperate to detect and repair preservation
failures. LOCKSS is designed to run on inexpensive hardware and
to require almost no technical administration. The software has
been under development since 1999 and is now distributed as open
source. Further information is available at the following
