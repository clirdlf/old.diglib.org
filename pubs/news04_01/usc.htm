photographs from the California Historical Society Collection of
over 23,000 photographs. The full archive was placed on long-term
deposit at USC in 1990 and includes the Title Insurance and Trust
Company, also known as TICOR, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce Collections, both of which are incomparable for the
documentary picture they provide of the development of the Los

photographs of the Title Insurance and Trust Company Collection,
(1860 - 1960) contains the work of C.C. Pierce which cover the
Los Angeles region city, street and architectural views,
California Missions, Southwestern Native Americans, and
turn-of-century Nevada, Arizona, and California. Pierce, active
from 1886 to 1940, was one of the leading photographers of his
day and amassed a collection of 15,000 images, including his own
and those bought and copied from his contemporaries, George
Wharton James and Charles Puck. The James collection contains
over 2,000 images of portraits, customs, ceremonies, arts, and

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-autospace:none'>Includes 1,040
color images of artifacts excavated from the site of the original
Los Angeles Chinatown; an additional 150 images document
artifacts from the site of a Chinese laundry in Santa Barbara.
These two outstanding Chinese Historical Society of Los Angeles
artifact collections are among the largest and best-documented
assemblage of cultural materials on Chinese settlement in the
United States. Excavated from unmixed dated sites with developed
historical context, the collections represent tremendous research
potential.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-autospace:none'> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-autospace:none'>The first and
larger collection consists of materials systematically excavated
in October/November 1989 and February/March 1991, during the
construction of the Metro-Rail Red Line by the Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Unearthed from a
sealed and unmixed deposit underneath Union Station, the
collection conveys information on the daily life and activities
of people from all walks of life and all classes of the Chinese
community from the1880's to 1933.Valuable data on food and
subsistence, medicinal preparations and health practices,
household technology, recreation, art, ritual patterns of space
usage, and interaction with the Anglo community can be garnered
from the objects, and changes over time may also be traced
stratigraphically.</p>

collection consists of materials excavated in 1992 during the
seismic upgrading by the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic
Preservation of an old adobe structure that for about 25 years
housed a Chinese laundry. These materials represent a valuable
resource for reconstructing a narrower range of Chinese working
class daily life in Santa Barbara from about the mid 1880s -
1905. The digitization of artifacts from these two sites was
supported by a grant from the John Randolph Haynes and Dora
Haynes Foundation. <a

<b>El Clamor Publico</b></p>
<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-autospace:none'>This archive is
available through a partnership with The Huntington Library, who
generously allowed USC to digitize their complete holdings of
this newspaper. Billed as Los Angeles' "Periodica Independiente y
Literacio," <i>El Clamor Publico</i> was the first
Spanish-language newspaper in California after the American
occupation. It was founded by the former Spanish editor of the
<i>Los Angeles Star,</i> Francisco P. Ramirez, a 19-year old
printer. Published weekly, 233 four-page issues were published
between July 1855 and August 1859. The initially moderate paper
evolved into an activist tabloid and espoused strong political
views generally in support of the Mexicanos. While articles
commonly dealt with American political ideology and practice, the
newspaper's publication of poetry and literature make it an
excellent source of cultural history. It was distributed as far
north as San Francisco. For additional information see an account
of the historic building in Los Angeles which housed the
newspaper at Mexican Americans in California.</p>

jarda.cdlib.org. JARDA includes access to more than 25 different
collections from four (eventually nine) institutions. It features
newly digitized photographs, documents, manuscripts, paintings,

<b>Sea of Korea Maps Digital Archive</b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText2" style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:windowtext'>This archive consists of 172 original
old maps, dating from 1606 to 1895, in English, French, Japanese,
Korean, Dutch, Latin, German and Russian. It was formed by
digitizing the combination of two private collections. The David
Lee Collection (of 132 maps) was assembled for the purpose of
documenting the application of the term "Sea of Korea" (or
similar terms) to identify the body of water between Japan and
Korea. The Shannon McCune Collection consists of the maps
gathered by the prominent professor of East Asian geography for
use in his distinguished teaching and research career. Together,
they help to illustrate how the West's image of East Asia evolved
over the course of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. See <a

style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-autospace:ideograph-numeric ideograph-other'>
<span style='color:windowtext'>A data and image base system of
ancient inscriptions and material culture archives from the Near
Eastern and the Mediterranean World. The initial participants
include West Semitic Research (WSR), the University of Southern
California, and the University of Illinois, leaders in the
application of photographic and computer imaging techniques to
capture and analyze visual data of ancient texts. The image data
include the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Canaanite
texts from the biblical period and earlier, Mesopotamian
documents and medieval Jewish manuscripts as well as the oldest
biblical text currently extant and the oldest complete Hebrew
bible in the world. These materials are scattered worldwide and
therefore cannot usually be viewed together for detailed
comparison and study. InscriptiFact brings these scattered
materials together virtually. The archive now contains about
100,000 high-resolution images and is growing. The InscriptiFact
Internet Database Prototype became available online with a test
set of 840 images in May 2003. An additional 5000 images will be
brought online in fall, 2003.The InscriptiFact application is
based on the Java programming language and Oracle&rsquo;s
database management system. InscriptiFact offers the capacity to
view cataloging for both the ancient texts and for the
photographs representing those texts. Among InscriptiFact's
features is a spatial search engine that facilitates user
definition of an area on a small-scale reference image of an
ancient text followed by the retrieval of all photographs that
include the defined area. InscriptiFact also includes an image
viewer that enables side-by-side comparisons with high-resolution
pan and zoom capabilities.</span>

<b>Geospatial/Temporal Interface:</b> USC Digital Information
Management group is working with the GIS Lab at USC to integrate
Geo-spatial search capabilities with Documentum software. A key
component of this work is the development of a gazetteer that
facilitates the look-up of geographic coordinates by tying place
names to them. Since most of the content in USC&rsquo;s Digital
Archives has a place name associated with it, but not the
geographic coordinates for that place, the gazetteer can be used
to facilitate a map-based search of the archives by acting as an
&ldquo;index&rdquo; that matches place names to geographic
coordinates. The GIS Lab has geocoded over 3,000 place names
associated with Los Angeles County as part of work on the
gazetteer.</p>

Plan</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Approximately
three years ago, USC&rsquo;s Information Services Division
embarked on a strategic planning process for library and
information technology services. The process has been
instructional and informative and resulted in the development of
six information pathways to guide development of library and
information technology services for greatest impact at
USC.&rdquo; Thus, all Digital Library initiatives at USC will be
in support of the strategic plan. See <a
