<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The IU Digital
Library Program received a grant from the Indiana State Library
through federal Library Services and Technology Act funding to
digitize and offer on the Web the 2,200 photographs in the U.S.
Steel Photograph Collection in the Calumet Regional Archive at IU
Northwest. Launched in February 2002, a Web site with photographs
and accompanying text materials and teacher guides is now
available.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>The Swinburne
Project</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Algernon Charles
Swinburne is a major Victorian writer and cultural figure. The
vast majority of his writings, however, are out of print. The
Swinburne Project provides a searchable electronic edition of
Swinburne's works, encoded in XML using the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) XML Document Type Definition (DTD).  The project
was released to the public in 2002 and has since been regularly
cited in online reference works and discussion groups devoted to
Victorian studies. A number of important volumes are currently
available and new titles continue to be added to the
collection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Russian
Periodical Index Digital Project</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b> </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A three-year,
United States Department of Education Title VI Technology Program
grant to the IU Digital Library Program provides for the
digitizing and Web publication of a portion of the Letopis'
Zhurnal'nykh Statei, a serial publication that indexes Soviet
periodicals from 1926 to the present. This resource will provide
access to the periodical literature for 1956-1975, a key time in
modern Russian history. Nearly the entire twenty years, including
over three million citations, became publicly available in March
2003. Following extensive usability testing the site was revised;
the final version of the site will be available in September
2003.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The DLP is actively
engaged in the development of services using the Open Archives
Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to make
information about digital library collections better available to
the users who might make use of them. In 2002, the DLP set up an
OAI-PMH data provider to allow other sites on the Internet to
harvest metadata records from the Frank M. Hohenberger Photograph
and DeVincent Sheet Music Collections in the Lilly Library at IU
Bloomington and the U.S. Steel Photograph Collection in the
Calumet Regional Archives at IU Northwest. In addition, the DLP
worked with the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis
at IU Bloomington to implement an OAI-PMH data provider for
metadata records from the Digital Library of the Commons.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In March 2002, the
Digital Library began work with UCLA and Johns Hopkins University
to create a metadata harvester for sheet music collections using
OAI-PMH. Harvested metadata about sheet music in participating
collections is hosted by the UCLA Digital Library Program. The
service has been available in test mode since December 2002. The
official launch, following extensive usability testing and
revision, will occur in August 2003. Currently, the Sheet Music
Consortium offers nearly 100,000 records for sheet music from
five libraries.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Finding Aids at
Indiana University. In July 2003, the Digital Library Program
made available a searchable collection of EAD finding aids from
the Lilly Library and the Indiana University Archives. Currently,
over 100 finding aids are available, with more to be added in the
future. In addition, other archives and libraries at Indiana
University will contribute finding aids in the future.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The EVIA Digital
Archive project is a joint effort of Indiana University and the
University of Michigan to establish a digital archive of
ethnomusicological video for use by scholars and instructors.
Currently in a development phase funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, Indiana University, and the University of Michigan,
the archive is being designed by experts in the fields of
ethnomusicology, archiving, video, intellectual property, and
digital technology. The Digital Library Program is providing
technical support for the project at Indiana University and will
sustain the repository after the project ends in 2005.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Begun in July 2002,
a two-year, United States National Endowment for the Humanities
grant to the IU Digital Library Program provides for the
conversion and Web publication of the <i>Film Literature
Index</i>, published in print by the Film and Television
Documentation Center at the State University of New York -
Albany. Film Literature Index is a quarterly subject/author index
that provides the most comprehensive survey available of the
entire spectrum of current international periodical literature
about film and television/video. It is currently only available
in print form. This project will make past and future Film
Literature Index issues available and searchable via the Web.</p>

Recording Studios Digital Archive</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In July 2003, we
received an LSTA grant to catalog, digitize, and provide public
access to 325 sound recordings from the Gennett Recording
Studios. The virtual collection will include sound recordings
from the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University and
the Starr-Gennett Archive in Richmond, Indiana (<a
href="http://starrgennett.org/">http://starrgennett.org/</a> ).
The sound recordings will be accessible via the Variations system
at IU and the web.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>CBML (Comic Book
Markup Language)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>LETRS (Library
Electronic Text Resource Service) leads the development of CBML,
an XML vocabulary for encoding comic books and graphic novels.
CBML will facilitate the preservation, study, and analysis of
these cultural artifacts, which are becoming ever more frequent
objects of study in a variety of disciplines, including history,
literary, and cultural studies. CBML was unveiled for the public
in December 2002 at the annual XML Conference and Exposition. As
part of the CBML development effort, Indiana University became a
member organization of OASIS, the Organization for the
Advancement of Structured Information Standards
(http://www.oasis-open.org/), an international, not-for-profit
standards organization and potential venue of for the further
development of CBML as an official standard.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Board of
Trustees Minutes</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The minutes of
meetings of the Board of Trustees are being digitized, encoded
using the TEI, and made fully searchable. The Board of Trustees
minutes stretch back to the late 19th century and provide a
unique history of Indiana University. Begun in fall 2002, this
project is a collaboration of the Digital Library Program,
University Archives, and the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Variations2
Digital Music Library</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Work continues on
the initiative to support research and development in digital
libraries for music. This initiative is funded by the National
Science Foundation's Digital Library Initiatives Phase 2 (DLI2)
program. Building upon VARIATIONS, the project aims to establish
a digital music library testbed system containing music in a
variety of formats, involving research and development in the
areas of system architecture, metadata standards, component-based
application architecture, usability, intellectual property
rights, and network services. In the first half of 2003, major
development was completed on version 2.0 of the Variations2
software system, adding features to support synchronized playback
and display of streaming audio and musical score images. We also
created a <i>Timeliner</i> tool to enable the creation of musical
form diagrams in conjunction with sound recordings in the digital
library. The system has been tested in several classes at IU and
also at a number of remote sites in the US, UK, and Japan.
Cooperative cataloging using Variations2's descriptive and
structural metadata schema was explored through work with the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Wright American
Fiction 1851-1875</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>This is a
cooperative project among nine CIC libraries, providing access to
a collection of almost 3,000 works of American fiction published
between 1851-1875. We launched the first release of the online
collection in January 2002, and as of December 2002 we now have
all of the works available. We continue to work to make the
collection completely edited and encoded.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Charles W.
Cushman Collection</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Originally funded
by a two-year grant (2000-2002) to IU from the Institute for
Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the grant has been extended
for a third year. The grant is to digitize and publish on the Web
the 15,000 slides comprising the Cushman Collection in the
University Archives in Bloomington. The work of the past year has
focused upon adding subject headings to each image and developing
the user interface. We also sent 250 slides that had experienced
color degradation (red-shifting) to a lab in Switzerland for
experimental color correction. The results were outstanding and
will be featured on the project web site. The collection has
become a testbed for developing a university-wide repository for
photographs from departments and other organizational units, in
addition to Digital Library Program projects. The project will be
launched officially in September 2003.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>IU Forum on
Digital Libraries</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In April 2002 we
held the first university-wide "IU Forum on Digital Libraries,"
at the Indiana Memorial Union, a day-long event showcasing 15
digital library projects from Bloomington and other campuses. 
The goal of this event was to share information about digital
library research throughout the university and foster the
development of creative partnerships.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Library
Program Forum</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In March 2003 the
Digital Library Program offered two 3-hour sessions providing an
overview of DLP initiatives and recent accomplishments. We
discussed how to work with the DLP to plan and manage a digital
project. The target audience was librarians and professional
staff.  As a result of these events, we will schedule follow-up
workshops and more specialized learning opportunities for
librarians and information technologists.  We have begun
scheduling a series of brown bag discussions, with the School of
Library and Information Science, for fall 2003.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Specific Digital Library
Challenges</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Encouraging the
use of standards and best practices.</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Some departments
and individuals have received grants to do small digital
projects. Because the amounts of money are small and the staff is
inexperienced, they often ignore standards and best practices.
Once the project has ended sustainability becomes an issue. Often
the project manager contacts the Digital Library Program about
taking over support for the project. How do we encourage people
to consult with us before beginning a project? How do we promote
the use of standards and best practices for projects that we are
not currently supporting? This was one of the goals of our forum
this past spring, but we must do more.</p>

<br />


<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Continuing
education for Digital Library Program staff.</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>We employ highly
knowledgeable and skilled staff. However, new staff may need
specific additional education or training. All staff requires
continuing education, including updates on current technologies
and information about emerging technologies. What is the best way
to provide this education and training? We hope to work with our
School of Library and Information Science and our School of
Informatics, both of which are Digital Library Program partners,
to address this challenge.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Implementation
of standard delivery services.</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Currently, we have
a number of different user interfaces, metadata approaches, and
technical backends in place to handle search, browse, and viewing
services for digital collections. This makes local
cross-collection searching, even among similar collection types
(such as historical photographs), difficult to implement. We
expect to work this year on defining a number of delivery
services, based on shared content and metadata characteristics
and user needs, and then beginning to implement these services by
acquiring or building the necessary software. What are the
appropriate categories of content for these services? Should we
take a buy or build approach, or mix and match? How will they
integrate with a future digital library object repository?</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Collection
maintenance once a digitization project has formally
ended.</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Once a collection
project has been "completed," the work is not really over.
Descriptive metadata corrections must be made based on newly
revealed information; individual items may need to be
re-digitized due to future discovery of quality problems;
contextual web site information must be updated; delivery
applications must be modified to accommodate hardware and
software upgrades; content must be migrated to new storage
systems. How can we organize Digital Library Program and other
library staff to continue maintaining digital collections? How
can we build our applications to easily accommodate these
maintenance requirements?</p>
