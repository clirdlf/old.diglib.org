The InsideWood Project is <i></i>a two-year NSF grant-funded
collaborative effort focused on development of an extensive,
Internet-accessible wood anatomy reference, research and teaching
tool. InsideWood will build on existing databases, specimen
collections, and photographic images at NC State and other
institutions. This project will develop a Web site with
nonexclusive, open architecture to allow for long-term
sustainability of the collection. Objectives include preservation
and integration of information from wood anatomy databases at
multiple institutions; development of a robust data structure and
search protocol; and creation of an Internet-accessible
collection of microscopic slide images. Instructional materials
on wood anatomy and a practical wood identification tool will be
included.</p>

<br />
In collaboration with the Forest History Society and The Biltmore
Company, the library has digitized primary research materials,
including photographs, diaries, correspondence, artifacts, and
printed materials relating to the Biltmore Estate Forest (some of
which is now part of the Pisgah National Forest) and the career
of Carl A. Schenck, founder and director of the Biltmore Forest
School, the nation's first school of forestry. The Schenck
Collection forms the foundation of the NCSU Libraries&rsquo;
special collections on forest history and natural resources.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>
An XML-based index to over 55,000 meetings of Congressional
committees (1985 to present) has been developed using Blue Angel
Technology&rsquo;s MetaStar repository software. Data is drawn
from meeting summaries found in the Congressional Record&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Daily Digest&rdquo; sections. The resource allows more
precise searching of this data than do existing government or
commercial indexes, and returns information about specific
meetings rather than a hit list of documents containing specified
search terms. The target audience is anyone interested in matters
under deliberation by Congress in recent years. This new research
tool is available to students, faculty, scholars, and the general
public.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Learning and
Research Center for the Digital Age<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In March 2003, the
NCSU Libraries opened its Learning and Research Center for the
Digital Age (LRCDA) in renovated space. The LRCDA brings together
a number of essential services and facilities to create a
technologically rich environment of collaboration, discovery, and
creativity. The LRCDA embodies important partnerships between the
NCSU Libraries and other key campus units, primarily the
university's Information Technology Division (ITD) and Distance
Education and Learning Technology Applications (DELTA)
organization. Staff from the Libraries, DELTA, and ITD work
together to provide technology training, consultation, and
guidance in the development of digital materials for teaching and
learning. LRCDA components include the Digital Media Lab,
Usability Research Laboratory, Information Technologies Teaching
Center, Scholarly Communication Center, Learning Technology
Service (DELTA), and Digital Library Initiatives Department.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>TEACH Act
Toolkit</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Technology,
Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002 (the TEACH
Act), enacted in November 2002, updates copyright law as it
applies to the transmissions of performances and displays of
copyrighted works, particularly during digital distance education
efforts. The NCSU Libraries&rsquo; Scholarly Communication Center
(SCC) has collaborated with Distance Education and Learning
Technology  Applications (DELTA), the Information Technology
Division (ITD), and the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) to create
&ldquo;The TEACH Act Toolkit&rdquo; to facilitate implementation
of the new provisions. This web-based resource includes
educational and implementation guides, checklists, policies,
scenarios, and other tools. Library staff are partnering with
DELTA to develop a solution to the technological controls
requirement of the Act. The TEACH Act Toolkit is widely used by
universities and colleges across the country.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Media
Lab</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A newly expanded
and renovated Digital Media Lab (DML) is now open in the Learning
and Research Center for the Digital Age. The new DML offers 20
workstations with peripheral hardware such as flatbed image
scanners, slide and negative film scanners, fast document
scanners, and a microform scanner. An expanded software suite to
assist in the creation and development of digital objects for
teaching and learning is available. The DML also provides access
to digital video and digital audio workstations in a separate,
soundproof room with controlled lighting. The digital video
workstation has the capability to import and edit both analog and
digital video. The audio-editing workstation permits the
conversion of analog audiocassette files to various digital
formats; captured audio files can then be edited and converted to
various digital formats. A GIS workstation and large format
plotter are also available.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Usability
Research Lab</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Usability
Research Laboratory in the LRCDA is a unique campus resource. It
was created to help interested faculty, students, and staff learn
the benefits of a user-centered approach to computer interface
design and to support usability testing. The new lab has two
separate rooms: one for observation and recording of the test
session and another for the test participant. Equipment in the
lab allows for collection of video, audio, and computer data
generated in real time for observation and analysis. The lab is
available for use by instructors who assign their students to
design and run usability tests as part of class projects. It is
also available to faculty, staff, and students in the campus
community wishing to incorporate usability testing into the
development of Web sites, software, or online course
materials.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Database
Finder</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Database Finder
was developed to improve discovery of key resources for students
and researchers across various subject disciplines. Subject
specialist librarians enhance catalog records for databases by
applying rankings to databases, indicating the level of
appropriateness for each discipline they cover.  These catalog
records are then harvested and converted to XML. XSLT processing
is used to generate ranked database listings for each of 65
discipline areas. These pages can be used as either a jumping-off
point to search appropriate databases individually, or as a
gateway to take advantage of the MultiSearch service.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a
href="http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/eresources/dbfinder.html">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/eresources/dbfinder.html</a></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>
<b>MultiSearch</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>MultiSearch was
developed to allow patrons to broadcast a search to a number of
databases simultaneously. Seeing how many results each database
yields for a given search allows the user to focus on the
databases that are most likely to be useful for finding articles
on a particular topic. Users may view the search results for a
given database directly through a customized MetaStar interface
or go directly to the database&rsquo;s native interface to
continue the search. Blue Angel Technology&rsquo;s MetaStar
software has been used to construct MultiSearch interface pages
for discipline areas accessible through the Database Finder.
Databases are searched through the Z39.50 protocol where such
access is offered. MultiSearch has also been integrated with SFX,
allowing a patron to click the SFX link and obtain the full text
if it is available.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><br />
<b>Library Online Basic Orientation</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>A next-generation
version of LOBO (Library Online Basic Orientation), a tutorial
introduction to library research, was made available as an
interactive tool to help students learn, evaluate, and use
information within the context of their first major college
writing assignments. Developed on the research process model,
LOBO includes modules covering the steps through which students
progress as they search for information for research papers.
Interactive components that illustrate complex concepts are
integrated into the tutorial. For example, a keyword builder
teaches students how to select and combine search terms, and a
citation builder helps the user create citations. Synchronous
communication between student and librarian is also featured.
This tutorial is used primarily with first-year students in
freshman composition classes.</p>

Deployment<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In order to improve
access to existing and planned image collections, Luna
Imaging&rsquo;s Insight software product was acquired in April
2003 with implementation work beginning shortly thereafter. The
first collection to be deployed will be selected from the North
Carolina State University Archives Photograph Collection, which
contains almost 250,000 photographs that document the history of
the university from its founding in 1887 to the present. The
library has also acquired access to the AMICO Library, which will
be available for cross-collection searching in connection with
other local digital image holdings such as the Design Image
Collection.</p>

between NCSU, Duke, and UNC-Chapel Hill<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>NCSU, Duke, and
UNC-Chapel Hill received a grant from the North Carolina
Networking Initiative to conduct a pilot implementation of the
Shibboleth architecture for inter-institutional sharing of Web
resources. The pilot is led by senior library and information
technology staff from each university. The goals of the pilot are
to address local issues related to implementation, and to
identify appropriate Shibboleth applications in library and
non-library domains. Key questions the group will examine are the
degree to which the campus implementations will be coordinated
and the identification of areas where this partnership might be
able to contribute to further Shibboleth development.<br />

style='font-size:16.0pt'>III. Specific Digital Library
Challenges</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Using Library
Catalog Data in Other Library Services and Applications</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>With the
implementation in 2003 of the Sirsi Unicorn ILS, the development
of an electronic resources management system
(&ldquo;E-matrix&rdquo;), and implementation of SFX, the NCSU
Libraries is now looking toward better integration of key data
sources. One such source is the catalog database, including both
bibliographic and associated holdings data. The ability to use
this data outside the ILS would allow improved virtual
integration of the print and electronic collections through
services such as SFX and the library&rsquo;s website.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Rethinking
MyLibrary@NCState<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>MyLibrary@NCState,
a customizable Web interface to library resources, has been fully
operational and available to faculty, students, and staff for
more than four years. Since usage statistics have indicated that
only a small number of MyLibrary account holders are frequent
users, the library has made the decision to separate the product
from the service and focus on the latter, pursuing further
development of the personalization and customization features
that are part of the MyLibrary service with hopes of reaching a
wider audience. Efforts will focus on the ability to create and
publish pages for courses and on the ability to create pages and
profiling options that would be useful for undergraduates, who
are not as discipline-focused as graduate students or
faculty.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a id="sec4"
name="sec4"></a><b>Digital Repository and Institutional
Repository Development<br />
<br />
</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The NCSU Libraries
is exploring the topic of institutional repositories with the
campus community. Specific challenges to institutional repository
implementation include gaining faculty acceptance, finding a
sustainable model for repository development, addressing
copyright and intellectual property issues, and implementing a
preservation plan. At the same time, the library is working to
develop a digital repository to house, preserve, and provide
access to digital objects owned by the library. One challenge is
that of defining the relationship between the technical
infrastructures for the institutional repository and the library
digital repository. Another challenge is that of identifying a
long-term, scalable, and reliable storage solution for repository
content.</p>
