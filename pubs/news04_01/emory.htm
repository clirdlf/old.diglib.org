<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>I.
Technology Standards</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>After beginning a series of in-house and
grant-funded digitization projects in the late 1990's using a
host of home-grown and commercial software applications, the
Emory libraries have more recently begun establishing shared
technology standards and benchmarks for all their current and
future digital initiatives.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The libraries have adopted use of
Extensible Markup Language (XML), the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI), Dublin Core, the Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and
SPSS and Stata statistical analysis software for digital
information resources developed on campus. Extant digital
collections previously developed on campus gradually are being
migrated into XML. All current and future digital initiatives
will be developed using the above markup standards.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt'>II.

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span

offered or in development are:</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The African American Cinema Collection
presents posters, lobby cards, and press books from the 1920s to
the 1990s.This collection is unique in the Southeast and
illustrates the often-delicate business of selling race-related
movies to white and black audiences. The strength of the
collection resides in the period from 1920-1980, which can be
divided into four chronological and thematic topics: race films
(1920-1949), &ldquo;integration&rdquo; motion pictures
(1950-1959), movies that reconsider the South (1960-1969), and
blaxploitation films (1970-1980).</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The collection is keyword searchable.
Due to copyright constraints on this ephemeral material, no
digital representations of collection materials are as yet
available.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Belfast Group Sheets</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 1963 Philip Hobsbaum, a
recently-arrived lecturer in English at Queen's University,
Belfast, organized a writing workshop made up of students,
faculty, and a number of writers from the local community. The
Group, as it has come to be known, met regularly during term.
When Hobsbaum left Belfast for the University of Glasgow, Seamus
Heaney assumed responsibility for organizing the meetings. Later
Michael Allen and Arthur Terry, both lecturers at Queen's, played
organizational roles as well.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Belfast Group ceased altogether in
1972 at a time when a remarkable number of the participants had
published their first collections and launched promising literary
careers. The participation of so many talented writers ensures
that the Group will remain of lasting interest to scholars and
literary historians.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The original Group sheets, from which
these searchable electronic texts have been prepared, are housed
in the Special Collections Department of the Robert W. Woodruff
Library of Emory University and in the Irish Collection of the
Queen's University Library. This digital collection forms one
part of Emory's larger <b>Electronic Poetry Project</b> and
<b>Poetry Portal</b> (see below).</span></p>

Project</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The Constituent Mail Analysis Project
(CMAP) explores the possibilities for studying constituent mail
using congressional correspondence management system files
generated by the United States Senate Computer Center.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Sam Nunn represented Georgia in the U.S.
Senate from 1972 to 1996 and his papers, now at Emory University,
provide an example of the types of benefits and challenges
offered by correspondence management systems. CMAP has used the
Nunn databases in its pilot project to demonstrate the kinds of
studies that might be done using such data. CMAP focuses in
particular on constituent interest in and opinions on legislative
issues as expressed in their correspondence with Senator Nunn. In
the future, Emory's Electronic Data Center hopes to include data
from other U.S. Senators to allow researchers to compare the mail
received in different offices.</span></p>

Center mounts popular data sets in a variety of subject areas.
These sets, searchable using an HTML template format which allows
novice data users to identify, can be used to analyze and extract
numeric data from files that are relevant, reliable and useful
for research in the social sciences and other disciplines. In
addition to data sets, users also have access to a limited number
of geographic information systems (see <b>GIS</b>
below).</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In 2000 British Holocaust denier
David Irving sued Emory University professor Deborah Lipstadt and
her British publisher, Penguin Books, for libel. Their London

resoundingly but also exposed the inner workings of the deniers,
who distort 20th century history in order to promote 21st century
anti-Semitism and white supremacy.</span></p>

library materials, finding out about overdue fines, recalling
books that are checked out or located at other libraries, as well
as assisting patrons with Interlibrary Loan procedures. In
addition, circulation staff will answer questions regarding the
Reserves desk, such as placing materials on reserve, how to
access those materials, and how to use the carryover
system.</span></p>

provide easy access to information resources, the General
Libraries, in collaboration with Emory's Information Technology

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>LIBNET represents a way of remotely
accessing a set of core library electronic resources from
anywhere on the Internet. It is a software application with
minimal requirements for hardware and network/modem speed, which
means that the software can run on many older, less powerful
workstations. LIBNET runs at no cost to the user and the LIBNET
software is free. LIBNET utilizes CITRIX server software and is
maintained by the General Libraries in collaboration with Emory's
Information Technology Division, for the use of the Emory

implementing SFX <i>ex libris</i> software with their integrated

who hosts them -- the library itself or external information
providers. The user will be presented with context-sensitive
links that are dynamically configured on the basis of our
institution's electronic collections, both locally produced and
commercially licensed.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Delivering online services outside of
library buildings and off-campus at universities and colleges is
quickly becoming a major and essential part of what we do in
libraries. The method that has become standard to support remote
access to online services from users' homes and offices is the
proxy server, which acts as an intermediary between the remote
users and the database servers that the library makes
available.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>Properly configured, proxy servers can
act as "doormen" ensuring that only authenticated users are
allowed to pass. Properly configuring proxy servers is becoming a
campus-wide security issue, however, and will definitely require
much more institutional focus in the coming year.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>The expanding user demand for wireless
access to library systems and services also presents related
database security issues, not the least of which is
authentication for valid Emory affiliates.</span></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>In the coming year we expect to
collaborate closely with our campus information technology
division to identify support and security issues and develop
guidelines and protocols which will equitably balance our users'
desires for easy access, any time and any where, with security
and commercial licensing requirements.</span></p>
