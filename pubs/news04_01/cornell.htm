<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Andrew Dickson
White Architectural Photographs document a wide range of 19th-
and early 20th-century architecture of Europe, the Middle East
and the Americas, including structures, panoramas and habitats
that have vanished due to wars and urban development. The images
also represent the work of important photographers, such as
William James Stillman, the Bisson Fr&egrave;res, Felix Bonfils
and Edouard-Denis Baldus. The collection has received substantive
curatorial attention and conservation treatment since September,
1999, when it was awarded a grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas
Foundation. The 13,000 photographs that comprise the A. D. White
Photographs Collection are now being catalogued and digitized and
offered to the public via Luna Insight&rsquo;s Browser
Insight&reg; II software. The project is a collaboration of the
Department of Preservation &amp; Conservation, the Cornell
Institute for Digital Collections and the Division of Rare and
Manuscript Collections.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>AgNIC provides
agricultural information collected by the National Agricultural
Library (NAL), land-grant universities and other governmental and
non-governmental agricultural organizations. It is an Internet
portal to agricultural information that provides both subject
content and expertise in agricultural topics.  Materials are
accessible via World Wide Web and include full text reports and
articles as well as statistical and other data. Staff at the
Albert R. Mann Library, Cornell University, worked with the
National Agricultural Library to develop a new technical
infrastructure for a consortium of land-grant institutions. The
new infrastructure improves the functionality, interoperability,
and public interface for the more than 25 institutions
participating in the alliance.</p>

<b>ArXiv.org</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>ArXiv.org is a
fully automated electronic archive and distribution server for
research papers in physics, computer science, mathematics, and
other scientific communities. Users and authors interact with the
arXiv using a web interface, ftp, or e-mail. Authors can update
their submissions if they choose, though previous versions remain
available. Users can also register to automatically receive an
email listing of newly submitted papers in areas of interest to
them. Physicist Paul Ginsparg, the creator of the arXiv, joined
the Cornell faculty in the fall of 2001. He and the arXiv are
credited with starting a revolution in the way physicists,
mathematicians, and computer scientists engage in scholarly
communication. The arXiv receives approximately two million
visits to its Web site per week, with about 65% coming from
outside the U.S. Currently receiving more than 3,000 new
submissions per week, it now contains over 180,000 articles, all
of which are immediately accessible online at no submission
charge. The benefit to the communities served is immediate
awareness of, and equal access to, the newest research results in
their areas. CUL staff administer the daily submission process
and are rewriting some of the software to streamline these
procedures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Beautiful Birds
traces the development of ornithological illustration in the 18th
and 19th centuries and highlights the changing techniques &mdash;
from metal and wood engraving to chromolithography &mdash; during
that period. This site highlights Cornell University
Library&rsquo;s Hill Ornithology Collection, which chronicles the
pre-1900 development of ornithology as a science, and depicts the
growth of bird illustration as an art form, with particular
concern for comprehensiveness in North American ornithology.</p>

Bargaining is an impartial, tri-partite agency created by local
law as authorized by the New York State's Taylor Law. It was
established by the City of New York after negotiations and
agreement with unions representing City employees. The OCB
provides assistance to management (the City), and labor (unions
representing city employees) in resolving their differences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Division of
Rare and Manuscript Collections has digitized 1,733 slides from
the Claire Holt Collection. Claire Holt, a specialist in
Indonesian culture, was a feature writer and art critic for the
<i>New York World</i>. In the 1930s, she traveled to Bali, where
she studied and became an expert on Balinese dance, working with
Margaret Mead and other anthropologists, archaeologists, and
cultural historians. She came to Cornell in 1954 as a Senior
Research Associate in the Southeast Asia Program. She continued
to do field work in Indonesia, with the support of the
Rockefeller Foundation. In 1967, she published <i>Art in
Indonesia: Continuities and Change</i>, introducing readers to
the infinite varieties of Indonesian art, both past and present.
The collection includes slides of Indonesia created for the
Indonesian Arts Project.  Subjects include art, architecture,
ceremonies, landscapes, paintings, people, sculpture, textiles,
and theatre. Many of them provide visual documentation for Holt's
detailed notebooks of her trips to Indonesia, and portray artwork
that may no longer be available in the original. A selection of
the images is included at the URL below. The full set of images
can be viewed using the Luna Imaging's <i>Insight</i>&reg; client

African Artists Database</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>This database is
the result of a Rockefeller and Ford Foundation funded initiative
designed to document and disseminate contemporary African art, as
well as promote networking between African artists and art
institutions. The computerized database will also be used to
generate a series of bio-bibliographic dictionaries. The database
is classified by country and includes artists who have been
working since the 1920's, in addition to important artists from
earlier dates. Both database and printed volumes include sections
on public and private art museums, galleries, archives,
collections, art schools, and other resources relevant to each
country. In conjunction with Salah Hassan, Associate Professor in
Africana Studies and the History of Art departments at Cornell
University, and the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library, Cornell
Institute for Digital Collections (CIDC) is providing
infrastructure and systems support for the Contemporary African
Artists Database (CAAD) project. CIDC staff developed a database
that is used to organize and characterize information about the
artists, such as artistic genre and media, nationality, and
exhibitions. The contemporary African artists database is
accessible via the web for searching. In addition, authorized
users can update and add to the database via the web site. CIDC
has linked up to five representative images to the database
record for each artist, thus providing a sample of the artist's
work.</p>

relationships among existing web-based content, minimize
duplication of information while greatly improving the
opportunities for discovering the full breadth and depth of
Cornell's life sciences activities. The site&rsquo;s function is
to bridge from a Google-like search front end directly to the

provide users direct, searchable access to course descriptions,
department and field information, events, faculty research, and

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Within the past
decade the Internet has emerged as a vital channel of political
communication. It now serves political parties, activists,
popular fronts, and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as
a widely accessible and relatively unrestricted global message
board. Critical documents such as manifestoes, constitutions,
declarations, and treaties posted to the Web are the digital-era
counterparts of the posters, pamphlets, and other forms of
&ldquo;street literature&rdquo; that have long provided
indispensable data on political activities and social and
ideological trends. However, Web-based political communications
tend to be produced sporadically and to change and disappear
rapidly. Unless they can be preserved and archived in a format
that will be accessible in years to come, their value as original
source material will be lost. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
awarded a grant to the Center for Research Libraries (CRL) for a
project entitled Political Communications Web Archiving to

capture when appropriate. The research evaluates Web resources as
individual pages, as pages on a site, as a site on a server, and
as an asset that is managed by an organization that is accessed

databases</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>One outcome of the
&lsquo;genomics revolution&rsquo; is an explosive growth in
databases of biological data and the development of tools and
techniques to manage those data, often called bioinformatics.
That growth has reached overload proportions for individual
researchers. Furthermore, the databases are no longer an arena
exclusive to clinical or purely genetics research. The resources
are of use to a wide range of researchers looking at life
sciences problems, from the computational scientists developing
ways to visualize microarray expression data, to the plant
breeder seeking to improve rice stocks, to the molecular
biologist looking at protein structure. Libraries have the
expertise to contribute discovery and acquisition/licensing
activities, and to help researchers organize, build, and
distribute their data. They can also help in the integration and
data mining efforts. The Cornell Library is developing expertise
in biology databases and establishing connections with campus
bioinformatics researchers and in the units providing
infrastucture support to the research and teaching programs of
the University. A team of librarians from the science units is
engaged in this program and Mann Library has redefined a position
to focus on bioinformatics and life sciences services and is
recruiting at this time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Expanding
development of Digital Consulting and Production Services
(DCAPS)</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>DCAPS offers a
suite of digital asset management services supporting digital
resource development, from feasibility assessment to full-scale
production. Leveraging the Library&rsquo;s existing experience
and expertise, D-CAPS is comprised of associated services
necessary to insure cost-effective creation, management, use, and
preservation for digital collections. Presently the services
include digitization, metadata, copyright, and delivery
technology consulting and implementation support. Challenges
include further elaboration of the business model underlying this
entrepreneurial development, expansion of component services, and
design and implementation of effective marketing strategies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Geospatial Data
preservation</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The Cornell
University Library has begun exploring digital preservation for
geospatial data. This is an area where little progress has been
made and little or no research has been done. At present there
are no models (like the Open Archives Information System model)
that work to effectively preserve the complex raster and vector
geospatial data formats. Geospatial data is unlike any other
format in terms of preservation due to complexities within
multiple file component structures (i.e. shapefiles and
coverages). These file structures make the &ldquo;digital
object&rdquo; difficult to define and geospatial data formats are
not often documented as coherent digital objects. True digital
preservation of geospatial data is impossible to accomplish
without first considering (1) how the data has evolved from the
time it was created, and (2) the presence and quality of the
metadata associated with it (or lack there of). The CUGIR working
group, with their knowledge of geospatial data formats, has begun
to formulate preservation policy considerations for the CUGIR
repository.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Identifying a
working set of preservation metadata elements for the
Digitization Service while international standards development
continues</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Cornell University
Library recently tested a model for developing policies and
procedures in areas of shared responsibility by bringing together
a core group of stakeholders that represented the digitization
service development team, digital preservation and metadata
expertise, and library system implementation initiatives. The
Preservation Metadata Working Group sponsored by OCLC and RLG are
working on a year-long project to provide implementation
guidelines for preservation metadata (part 2 of their standards
developments work (http:www.oclc.org/research/pmwg/). In the
meantime, organizations need to continue working in a
standards-aware manner. This is the Library&rsquo;s effort to do
just that. The Working Meeting on Preservation Metadata can be
found at:</p>
