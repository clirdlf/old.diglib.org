<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>The American
Soldier Surveys</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b><br />
</b>During WWII, the Army conducted hundreds of surveys of
American troops, covering topics relating to soldiers' attitudes
toward the war, morale, and education. The collective survey
results affected many aspects of federal policy in the post-war
years, from promotion of the GI bill extending educational
benefits to veterans, to desegregation of the military. The
Geostat collection contains 137 surveys covering 78 different
studies.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>The Barcelona
Collection</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><br />
The Barcelona Collection consists of approximately 850 images
shot on site in Barcelona, Spain and a small number of images
digitized from the Fine Arts Library Visual Collection. The
present collection is the result of work done on a grant-funded
annual trip to Barcelona by graduate students in the University
of Virginia School of Architecture. Most of the images were shot
on site by the professors and students, and were intended as part
of the teaching environment for the annual Barcelona studio
class. Since the Barcelona studio class continues to be an annual
event, the collection will continue to grow and evolve.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Colonial Revival
in America: Annotated Bibliography</b><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Originating from
the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Architecture Department, this
bibliography provides an annotated listing of scholarly and
popular literature that addresses the Colonial Revival in
architecture, painting, sculpture, landscape design, decorative
arts, furniture, and cultural studies from the 1870s to the

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Published in its
original edition in 1973-74 and last reprinted in 1977-1980, the
<i>Dictionary of the History of Ideas</i> was a culminating work
in a tradition that had been energized by the fight against
fascism. It was a tradition committed to the pursuit of
disinterested scholarship in the academic sphere and to free
expression of thought in the political sphere (as in Arnaldo
Momigliano's article "Freedom of Speech in Antiquity"). This
project was undertaken in collaboration with <i>The Journal of
the History of Ideas</i> and in permission granted from the Gale
Group.<br />
