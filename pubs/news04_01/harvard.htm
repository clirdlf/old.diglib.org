<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Harvard
Libraries web site</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The &ldquo;Harvard
Libraries&rdquo; site is a comprehensive web interface that
presents a single, organized view of web-accessible resources
available to the Harvard community. The site also serves as an
electronic gateway to Harvard&rsquo;s union catalogs and to
comprehensive information about Harvard&rsquo;s libraries. On
June 25, 2003, the Harvard University Library Office for
Information Systems launched a revised "portal" page for the
Harvard Libraries site (<a
href="http://lib.harvard.edu/">http://lib.harvard.edu</a> ). The
major goals of this revision were to improve design and
usability, increase flexibility, simplify maintenance, and
provide a short-term solution until the planned introduction
later in 2004 of a completely new library research portal based
on MetaLib software from Ex Libris.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Total number of
electronic resources listed as of July 1, 2003: 5,325</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Implementation
of SFX</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>SFX is an exciting
new research tool from Ex Libris that was implemented in the
Harvard Libraries on January 8, 2003. The tool uses
resource-linking technology based on the OpenURL standard to
allow users of external research databases to link directly from
an article citation or abstract to a variety of related resources
determined by the local library or institution. With the click of
a button, SFX can provide access to the full text of an article
(if available) or to local holdings in the HOLLIS catalog. It
permits context-sensitive and dynamic linking between web-based
resources in which the actual links are customized to reflect
licensed digital resources available to users affiliated with
Harvard. During the academic year, usage of SFX quickly neared
2,000 hits per day. In addition to the implementation of SFX, two
related products were launched during this past year &ndash;
<i>Citation Linker</i> and <i>EJ2: supplementary list of
e-journals</i>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a
href="http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/sfx/">http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/sfx/</a></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The SFX <b>Citation
Linker</b> was released together with SFX on January 8 and is a
web facility that allows the user to enter information directly
for a specific article or journal citation so that they may
generate an SFX menu of links for that citation. The Citation
Linker is available on the e-resources menu of the Harvard
Libraries website and use of this popular tool is increasing at a
steady rate; approximately 18,000 hits were recorded from January
through June 2003.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>EJ2:
supplementary list of e-journals</b> was made available on the
Harvard Libraries website in June</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>2003. This list of
e-journals is generated from the SFX database and includes
hard-to-find titles in aggregated collections. There are
approximately 10,000 titles included on the EJ2 list, over half
of which currently have no other point of access on the portal or
in the OPAC.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><a

http://sfx.hul.harvard.edu:82/sfx_local-e-collection/e-journals-A.html</a></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Electronic
Resource Management System</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>In a collaborative
effort with staff from the MIT Libraries and Ex Libris, OIS met
extensively during the first half of 2003 to define functional
requirements and specific data elements in support of an
electronic resource management module to be developed by the Ex
Libris Information Services Division and designed to interact
heavily with Aleph, SFX and MetaLib. Results from this project
were also fed back into related work being done under the
auspices of the Digital Library Federation. Participation in the
Harvard/MIT work was extended to include members from the North
American Aleph Users Group (NAAUG) and the International
Consortium of Aleph Users (ICAU). Ex Libris will announce their
plans for development of the e-resources management module at the
September ICAU meeting in Vienna. Local development at Harvard
will supplement the Ex Libris project as appropriate.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Harvard Cross
Catalog Search</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>On November 6,
2002, Cross Catalog Search service was made available from the
portal as a demonstration system to gauge the public&rsquo;s
reaction to federated searching across multiple Harvard catalogs.
It was developed using a subset of an early version of the
MetaLib software from Ex Libris. This service is a high-level
resource discovery tool which allows the user to search
simultaneously across five of Harvard&rsquo;s catalogs, including
HOLLIS, Baker, VIA, OASIS and HGL.  From November through the end
of the academic year, the number of searches totaled over 17,000
with approximately 6,000 sessions recorded.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Feedback from both
staff and patrons using Cross Catalog Search indicated a strong
desire to be able to search research databases and other external
resources together with Harvard library catalogs. With this in
mind, the Office for Information Systems began to look seriously
at the new version of the MetaLib software which offers federated
searching and personalization features not now available on the
Harvard Libraries portal. A recommendation to pursue the analysis
and implementation of MetaLib as the next generation portal
software was approved and a full implementation is planned for
mid-2004.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span
lang="FR">Digital Audio</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Digital audio
represents the most complex digital resource that LDI has been
asked to support. This year, working in conjunction with David
Ackerman, the Audio Preservation Engineer at the Loeb Music
Library, LDI staff have developed the specifications for the
deposit to DRS of audio works. Deposits consist of multiple
versions of digital audio files including high resolution
archival and production masters, and lower resolution use copies
as well as a wealth of metadata to capture the technical
properties of the audio files, the processing history, and the
structure and relationships between these various components. OIS
is now developing a new desktop application, Dmart, to automate
the complicated packaging of these components. Dmart, along with
an upgrade to the DRS data model and new loading procedures to
accommodate digital audio works will be available in late summer
2003.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The listening
versions of audio works will be delivered via RealAudio through
the new Streaming Delivery Service (SDS) developed this year. SDS
uses Access Management Service (AMS) to control access to audio
materials restricted to the Harvard community and supports usage
logs to meet the legal requirements imposed by copyright holders
of digitized material. The archival and production master
versions of audio files can be retrieved from DRS (by authorized
owners) using the WebAdmin interface and Asynchronous Delivery
Service (ADS).</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b><span

Facilities</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'><b>Fine Arts
Library Digital Imaging Lab (FAL DIL)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>The Digital
Imaging Lab (DIL) is part of the Fine Arts Library Slides and
Digital Images Department in the Harvard College Library (HCL).
The lab was established to provide digital images of slides for
use with the Instructional Computing Group's (ICG) digital
carousel tool currently used by faculty, and to provide study
images of slides for VIA. The lab serves the faculty and students
of the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, as well
as faculty from throughout FAS, including the extension school
and Harvard's learning in retirement program.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>In FY 2003, FAL
DIL scanned and deposited into Harvard's DRS 20,697 images,
including some image files from vendors. In addition, the DIL
does special project scanning for LDI grants and other projects
including an up-coming exhibition and publication detailing the
history of the Fogg Art Museum.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'><b>Harvard College
Library Digital Imaging Group</b> <b>(HCL DIG)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>HCL DIG, a
division of the Preservation &amp; Imaging Department in the
Harvard College Library, produces high-quality digital
reproductions of library and archival materials, and offers image
processing, metadata creation, and DRS deposit services on behalf
of HCL and other repositories throughout the University.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>During FY03, DIG
created and deposited 38,825 digital objects into DRS including
17,950 master archival images with their associated derivatives
and 1,228 XML-formatted structural metadata files. This year, HCL
DIG work included reformatting for seven LDI-funded grant
projects and the scanning and processing of 18,389 page-images
for HCL&rsquo;s Reserves Program.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'><b>Harvard
University Art Museums Digital Imaging and Visual Resources (HUAM
DIVR)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>HUAM DIVR creates
high quality digital images of art objects and ephemera in the
collections of the Harvard University Art Museums through direct
digital capture and conversion of film surrogates. HUAM DIVR
handles internal requests from curators, registrars, and staff in
exhibitions, publications and public relations, as well as
external requests for scholarly, non-profit and commercial use in
research and publications.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>During FY 2003,
HUAM DIVR created over 70,000 images and deposited 94,719 into
DRS. The deposits comprise 2 terra-bytes of space and correspond
roughly to 21,864 unique images with their associated
derivatives.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'><b>Peabody Museum
of Archaeology and Ethnology</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:1.0in'>This year, the
Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology developed the
capacity to make batch deposits to DRS.  As part of their LDI
grant project, the museum outsourced the creation of digital
images for photographs from 35mm copy positive reel film and
deposited in DRS three digital versions of each image (an
archival master, a reference image and a thumbnail). During
FY2003, a total of 31,254 image files representing approximately
10,000 photographs were deposited. The images and their
associated catalog records are available to the public through
VIA and additional information is made available for staff use
through the museum's collection management database.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>HOLLIS (Harvard
Online Library Information System)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The HOLLIS Catalog
of the Harvard University Libraries is a database containing over
10 million records for books, journals, electronic resources,
manuscripts, government documents, maps, microforms, music
scores, sound recordings, visual materials, and data files owned
by the Harvard University Libraries. The union catalog is updated
continually as material is ordered, received, and cataloged.  In
FY2003:</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> the
loading and indexing of 515,300 CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
records was completed, allowing searching in HOLLIS of these
records in the native scripts.  For Chinese materials, records
that were formerly in Wade-Giles Romanization were also converted
to pinyin. Additional non-Roman scripts will be added in the
coming year.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span>
Z39.50 access to the HOLLIS Catalog was implemented in March
enabling authorized Harvard users to conduct HOLLIS searches
using a Z39.50 client such as EndNote, in addition to a web
browser.  This access is currently limited to members of the
Harvard community with valid IDs and PINs. </p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"

style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> Work
on the ILS staff functions included the addition of a desktop
reporting module which allows users to report on data extracted
from Aleph including acquisitions and financial data, circulation
history, reserve courses and bibliographic data, and selected
fields from the MARC bibliographic and holdings data.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"

style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> work
began on beta-testing the newest release of the Aleph software,
version 16, with full implementation expected by January 2004. 
The major enhancement included in version 16 is a redesign of the
Aleph clients for staff functions, including cataloging and
acquisitions.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>
<b>E-reserves</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>E-reserves is a
web-based service that provides students with online access to
course reserves reading materials. Through the new HOLLIS
Catalog, users have integrated access to both E-reserves and to
information about print reserves. In the 2003 academic year, the
system supported a total of 136 courses offered by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Divinity School with links to
2,162 items on reserve.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>VIA</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>VIA (Visual
Information Access) is Harvard&rsquo;s web-based union catalog of
visual resources in art, architecture, and material culture. VIA
records include descriptive information about slides,
photographs, drawings, paintings, objects and other artifacts
held by the university's libraries, museums, and archives. In
FY2003, detailed functional specifications and technical analysis
for a new system architecture were completed. The new system with
improved functionality will be implemented in FY2004.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Total number of

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>OLIVIA is a
cataloging system for the creation of descriptive metadata about
visual resources that will be exported to VIA for public access. 
In FY2003 more than 40 catalogers worked in OLIVIA, which served
as a primary work environment for approximately half of them. In
FY2003, a number of small system enhancements were undertaken to
increase cataloging efficiency, including a merge and de-duping
function for duplicate catalog records and the capability to link
OLIVIA records to restricted images stored in the DRS.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Total number of

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Harvard Geospatial
Library (HGL) is both a discovery tool and a data mining
environment for geospatial data sets.  Unique to the digital
library world, HGL provides researches with detailed information
about geospatial data and the tools to capture and deliver
subsets of the data into their research environment.  A major new
feature developed in FY2003 allows researchers in other systems
to pass information into HGL, combining their data with
HGL&rsquo;s to create customized maps. Other enhancements to HGL
in FY2003 include metadata and cartographic searching
improvements, cataloging and data loading efficiencies, and

Database Service (TED)</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>TED is a powerful
new system designed and developed in FY2003 to provide an online
home to the myriad of small, specialized collections catalogs
which do not fit within the scope of existing Harvard catalog
systems. TED can provide web based access to data that might
otherwise be hidden in boxes of cards or desktop computers across
campus without requiring an extensive OIS implementation effort
or the need for high-level programming skills. Any number of
unique databases can be created with TED in order satisfy the
needs of many individual projects.  With assistance from a
metadata analyst, collection managers can create an XML schema,
select field names, and define the interface for their own
database. Data can be imported from an existing database or
created on-line using the TED Maintenance system. Each database
is built on the same framework which fosters centralized system
support such as software upgrades and data migration. The first
collection using TED was launched this year: the Biomedical Image
Library (<a

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Harvard University
launched the Library Digital Initiative (LDI) in July 1998 to
develop the University's capacity to manage digital information
by creating a robust technical infrastructure for the
acquisition, organization, delivery, and archiving of digital

librarians and others in the University community on key issues
in the digital environment; by providing librarians and staff
with experience in digital library projects; and by enriching the
Harvard University Library system with a significant set of
digital resources. Now entering its sixth year, LDI is making it
easier for Harvard's libraries to maintain their collections and
services in the digital era, without each library having to
individually acquire the expertise and systems needed to support
digital resources. The development of most of the systems and
services documented in this report were funded by LDI.</p>

repositories; and the development of new delivery systems for
natively digital material. Many projects have focused on
providing access to previously inaccessible collections and
making them available online for use by students and scholars at
Harvard and around the world. Over the last five years 30
projects were funded through the grant program and nearly 200
Harvard staff members gained experience working with digital

States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The
original source material for the project will include monographs,
manuscripts, and visual resources drawn from many of
Harvard&rsquo;s libraries, museums and other collections. The
resulting digital resources will be added to the appropriate
Harvard University Library catalogs (monographs in HOLLIS,

Specific Digital Library Challenges</span></b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Integration with
educational technology at Harvard</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The last few years
have seen an enormous growth in the use of the web for providing
information and tools to students for use in courses.  At
Harvard, a considerable infrastructure for supporting the
electronic delivery of course information has been developed,
most notably in the iCommons project (<a
href="http://icommons.harvard.edu/">http://icommons.harvard.edu</a>
). iCommons gathers instructional software developed at schools
throughout Harvard to create an integrated course platform.
Libraries of course have had an important traditional role in
providing resources for use in instruction, particularly in such
areas as undergraduate library collections, course
&ldquo;reserves&rdquo; services, and collections of teaching
slides. With the growth of digital library collections and of
course management systems, the mode of providing library support
for instructional materials will change. The primary
manifestation of that change will be the increasing integration
of Harvard&rsquo;s technical infrastructures for digital library
content (LDI) and course content (iCommons).</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>This year, a small
step in integrating library and course systems was undertaken
with a new facility in VIA, the visual collections catalog.
Instructors can make use of an export tool in VIA to download
images with descriptive metadata in a way that can be readily
imported into a digital carousel tool developed by FAS (and
jointly offered by FAS and iCommons) for creating slide shows. At
a more general level, discussions are now underway, both in the
larger educational environment, and specifically at Harvard,
about how digital library systems and various kinds of education
and research tools should inter-relate.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>There are a growing
number of common areas for potential collaboration between
iCommons and LDI including:</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span>
Reserves materials are increasingly available in digital formats
that could be made directly accessible from course web sites.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> The
library&rsquo;s increasing array of digital resources could be
presented to students in the context of the courses for which
they are most relevant.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> The
instructional and reference services already provided by
libraries can be made accessible from course web pages.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> The
digital collections infrastructure of the libraries can be used
to preserve digital materials created specifically for use in
courses, and to ensure access to the materials over time.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>Defining and
implementing modes of interoperation will be a key activity for
LDI and iCommons over the next few years.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital
Preservation</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>As increasing
amounts of digital content are produced at Harvard and stored in
the LDI Digital Repository Service (DRS), the importance of
ongoing preservation activities cannot be overstated.  Digital
materials are inherently fragile and completely dependent for
long-range viability on technologies that change continuously. 
To protect Harvard&rsquo;s digital resources into the future,
staff are developing expertise in the underlying digital formats
of objects accepted into DRS, and requiring extensive technical
metadata about these objects.  By closely monitoring the
technological environment underlying DRS, the various delivery
services, and the digital formats stored in DRS, LDI staff will
be able to initiate digital preservation activities to ensure the
future of the resources.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>For LDI and for the
University as a whole, digital preservation is a priority that is
reflected in several areas of progress in FY 2003:</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> A
national archiving environment, built upon the distributed
activities of independent institutions, requires a formal way of
communicating local preservation activities to prevent needless
duplication of effort. Various LDI staff are actively
participating with the Digital Library Federation in plans for a
national digital registry of born-digital materials and digitally
reformatted books and journals. <a
href="/collections/reg/reg.htm">http://www.diglib.org/collections/reg/reg.htm</a></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> As a
follow-up to last year's Mellon Foundation-funded ejournal
archiving planning project, LDI staff have collaborated with the
National Library of Medicine (NLM) to produce an open source
archiving and interchange XML DTD. The DTD is designed to
increase the ease of interchange between publishers and archives
for article-level ejournal content. Without this DTD, the
structure of ejournal content can vary widely, requiring costly
human intervention and multiple parallel workflows within
archival repositories. The DTD was designed after extensive
document analysis in many subject domains to insure that it does
not reflect the bias of any particular academic discipline. 
Furthermore, it is based on public standards, features a modular
structure to allow customization, and should be an easy target of
transformation from existing XML or SGML-encoded content.  In
addition to being used by NLM for the PubMed Central archive,
this DTD is well-positioned to become a standard format for the
transfer and archival storage of the scholarly literature. <a
href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/</a></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal"
style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> DI
staff are collaborating with JSTOR to produce an extensible tool,
called JHOVE, for automating format-specific validation of
digital objects. The tool, which will be made publicly available
under an open source license, is particularly useful for the
validation of digital objects submitted for deposit into a
digital repository such as DRS.  In addition, JHOVE has
facilities to extract important technical characteristics of
digital objects from the objects themselves. To ensure future use
of digital objects, it is important to verify that a format and
its characteristics have been correctly identified. The initial
deployment of JHOVE will provide validation for the PDF and TIFF
formats, including recognition of many specific format profiles,
or named constrained subsets.</p>

Adobe&rsquo;s Portable Document Format (PDF) has rapidly become a
de facto standard for the dissemination and presentation of
electronic documents on the web.  Unfortunately, the feature-rich
nature of PDF permits tremendous variability in the internal
structure of documents, and allows documents to be dynamically
composed at the time of their display from disparate external
resources, which leads to significant difficulties in insuring
their long-term viability.  In order to address these concerns, a
multi-national effort has been established within the ISO
standards framework to produce a constrained version of PDF
suitable for archival preservation, to be known as PDF/A. Stephen
Abrams, Digital Library Program Manager, is the project
leader/editor of the ISO Joint Working Group developing PDF/A.

style='margin-left:52.4pt;text-indent:-16.4pt'><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> Most
theoretical discussions of archival preservation revolve around
three main strategies: migration, emulation, and the
newly-proposed Universal Virtual Computer (UVC) approach.
However, there is little empirical data by which to evaluate the
comparative advantages and disadvantages of these methods. LDI
staff will have an opportunity to gain experience in format
migration as a result of the implementation of the new LDI Large
Image Delivery Service (LIDS). To date, most image objects in the
DRS were represented by TIFF master images and one or more JPEG
deliverables of various pre-formed sizes and qualities. LIDS will
continue to require the TIFF masters, but only a single
production master in the JPEG 2000 (ISO 15444-1:2000) format. All
deliverables, of arbitrary size and image quality can be
dynamically derived from this single JPEG 2000 object. LIDS
provides the opportunity to discard the old JPEG deliverables and
to convert TIFF images into JPEG 2000 images. This will involve
investigating technical problems and formulating new policies in
areas such as the appropriate degree of curatorial input, the
extent to which the process can be automated, determination of
the proper metadata to document the process, and establishing
necessary quality assurance procedures.</p>

style='font-size:5.0pt;font-family:Wingdings'>l<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>        </span></span> As
mentioned previously, preservation activities depend upon
extensive knowledge of the formats in which digital objects are
manifested.  Since this same information is useful to all
institutions interested in preserving their digital assets, there
is great economy of scale to having a central repository for this
format information. LDI staff have been instrumental in
organizing an ad-hoc international group of interested
stakeholders, including representatives of national libraries and
archives, and academic research libraries, who have met to
discuss the technical and policy issues surrounding the creation
and sustainable operation of a global digital format registry. 
Stephen Abrams, Digital Library Program Manager, co-authored a
paper on this topic presented at the 2003 IFLA conference,
available at <a

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Extended
Character Set Support</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The resources
supported by LDI infrastructure encompass many languages and
script systems.  The encoding of the Unicode character set
provides a uniform mechanism for electronically storing living
and historic languages and displaying them to online browsers.
Most LDI systems provide support for Unicode, including the
underlying technologies for HOLLIS, DRS, Full-text Search Service
(FTS); TED; OASIS, Page Delivery Service (PDS), and VIA. For ease
and efficiency of searching and retrieval in these systems, full
text is normalized to a canonical form (devoid of punctuation,
case distinction, and diacritic marks) prior to indexing and
search operations, while the original form of the text is
maintained for display. All systems share the same set of
normalization rules, based on rules from the library
community&rsquo;s long-standing Name Authority Cooperative
Program (NACO), so that patrons can expect similar search
behavior without regard to the particular system in which a
search is performed</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>While this
mechanism works well for languages based on the Latin alphabet,
challenges remain with properly supporting non-Latin script
systems, such as Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, and Asian languages. 
Content in these languages is easily accommodated in LDI systems
using Unicode, but there is no effective way to generate
non-Latin Unicode search terms using a standard Latin
character-based keyboard. Potential options include
transliteration (used, for example, by the HOLLIS OPAC for
Chinese) and Input Method Editors (IMEs), desktop applications
that provide a visual interface to language-specific
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo; keyboards. Both of these solutions require
significant analysis and present implementation difficulties with
regard to providing uniform user interface behavior across LDI
systems.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Integration with
the larger digital library environment</b></p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The digital
collections available to Harvard&rsquo;s users are accessed
through a large number of highly diverse systems distributed
across the entire Internet. Over the past decade this
heterogeneous environment has been created by many individual
players concentrating on how to best provide access to their own
individual set of resources. The current environment is one of
enormous richness, and enormous complexity. With the increasing
complexity of the digital environment, there is a growing need to
begin integrating the many systems that make up our
&ldquo;digital collection&rdquo; in ways that insulate users from
this underlying confusion.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The implementation
this year of the SFX system is one step in creating a more
integrated environment for Harvard library users. SFX provides a
way to navigate easily from a citation in one system to the cited
book or article in another. This navigation is tailored to the
Harvard information environment, so that users are led only to
systems to which they have free access.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>During the next
year we will implement another tool to help integrate resources,
a new portal system that will provide users with the ability to
simultaneously search for resources across a variety of systems
with a single transaction.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>SFX and the new
portal are ways for us to bring together diverse resources in
systems beyond our borders. There are likewise ways in which
Harvard&rsquo;s internal digital resources can be integrated into
the larger environment. Making information about our locally
produced resources available through outside databases, making
our catalogs accessible to other portal systems, and insuring
that digital resources we create follow standards so that they
are useable in systems beyond Harvard are all steps to increasing
interoperation in the wider library environment.</p>

<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'>The ability to
integrate diverse resources in ways that simplify use is an
increasingly important development in the larger information
technology environment. Many products are now trying to integrate
tools and data into people&rsquo;s working environments in a way
that they need not be concerned about <i>where</i> those tools or
data originate. Digital libraries, with their enormous range of
diverse and distributed resources, will benefit greatly from
developments of this sort. Integration and the erasing of
barriers to the use of distributed resources will be a key theme
in digital library developments over the next decade.</p>
