<span style='color:black'>The <i>Charette</i> Digital Project
provides web-based public access to a regional architectural
journal. <i>Charette</i> (vols. 1-54, 1920-1974) was the journal
of the Pittsburgh Architectural Club; and was later co-sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Institute of Architects
and the Pennsylvania Society of Architects. Over the years, its
coverage of architecture extended to the whole of Pennsylvania,
eastern Ohio, and West Virginia. Carnegie Mellon University
Libraries holds an extensive run of <i>Charette</i>, and borrowed
missing issues from other institutions for scanning. Copyright
status was investigated and permissions were acquired as needed.
The <i>Charette</i> Digital Project created digital images of
each page of <i>Charette</i> including text, photographs,
graphics, advertisements, etc. To date, a web site has been
created and a test version of the browsing interface is
operative; a full-text searching interface is in development. The
<i>Charette</i> Digital Project is a project of the Carnegie
Mellon University Architecture Archives. [contact: Martin Aurand,

Technical Reports</b> (2002-)</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The University
Libraries plan to digitize all of the Carnegie Mellon Technical
Report series. Permission to digitize the reports will be
acquired from the copyright holders. To date, Robotics Institute
and Mathematics technical reports have been digitized (nearly 700
reports). The digitized reports are available via links in the
Carnegie Mellon library catalog and WorldCat, and in the Million
Book Project collection. [contact: Ann Marie Mesco, <a

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Costume Books
Project</b> (planning phase)</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>For the last
decade, the library has housed a selection of 157 costume books
in non-circulating reserves at faculty request. There is
extraordinary contention for these books, which are critical to
students preparing for class assignments and productions. The
library is seeking funding to make these items accessible via the
Internet through a non-destructive digital scanning process.
Scanning will eliminate the problem of contention and provide
access to the images and text of the books 24/7. Scanning will
also extend the life of those items that have become worn or have
loose plates. Books whose copyright has expired will be made
available on the web for a worldwide audience, while attempts
will be made to obtain permissions to make copyrighted material
more widely available - otherwise, Internet Protocol
authentication will be used so that only Carnegie Mellon users
will have access to the items. [contact Bella Gerlich, <a

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Digital Image Database</b></p>

<p
style='margin-left:.5in;tab-stops:48.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none'>
<span style='color:black'>Currently in the user-testing phase,
the University Libraries Image Database will be introduced to the
campus community in the spring of 2004. Based on the
library&rsquo;s Slide Collection requests and usage, the images
will be searchable and available via the web for viewing and
using in a classroom setting. Digitization expands authorized
access and eliminates contention for individual slides. For each
image there will be three JPEG files accessible in various sizes
(constraining tool will automatically adjust height and width):
thumbnail (128 x 99 dpi), working (640 x 480 dpi) and
presentation (1024 x 768 dpi). In addition, an archival copy of
each image will be preserved using the highest possible
resolution TIFF format and kept on tape back-ups. Image
resolutions were decided based on recommendations/standards from
the Library of Congress (American Memory Collection) website,
ARLIS conference presentations, various listservs and
professional communiqu&eacute;s. Copyright and/or source
information will be provided in for each record. The intellectual
content provided to catalog the images will be generated by
library staff or, in the case of purchased collections, by the
vendor. The Getty Research Institute&rsquo;s Vocabulary
Databases, made available via the web to support limited research
and cataloging efforts, may be consulted to standardize creator
names, confirm dates, etc. The Image Database will be available
to Carnegie Mellon users only through Internet Protocol
authentication.</span> [contact Bella Gerlich, <a

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>
Designed to address inequities in the size and accessibili>ty of
library collections, to facilitate scholarship and lifelong
learning, and provide a large test bed to support digital library
research, the international Million Book Project aims to digitize
and provide free-to-read access to a million books by 2007. The
Million Book Collection will be a multilingual collection of
collections selected by librarians, including public domain
materials, government documents, and copyrighted books. The
National Science Foundation has granted Raj Reddy and Gloriana
St. Clair of Carnegie Mellon $3.6 million for scanning equipment
and administrative travel. The governments of India and China are
providing the labor to scan the books and capture the metadata.
Project partners include the Internet Archive, the Online
Computer Library Center (OCLC), libraries in the United States,
and universities and research institutes in India and China. One
hundred thousand books are targeted to be available by 2004. A
pilot test was recently conducted to better understand costs and
issues related to shipping books to India. Based on the pilot
shipment of six thousand books, strategies have been developed
and implemented to reduce shipping costs and turn-around time.

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>One Million Digital Pages</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>In fall 2001, The
University Libraries celebrated a milestone: having digitized
more than one million pages of primary source material and making
it available to scholars on the web. Accomplished over several
years (1993-2001), the achievement includes developing standards
for digitization of archival material and for natural language
processing, and successfully migrating the digitized collections
to new technology (from HELIOS to DIVA) in the course of the
work. Three of the university&rsquo;s most important archival
collections were digitized: the <a

Project</a></b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>A generous
gift from Helen and Henry Posner Jr. in honor of Henry Posner Sr.
and his wife Ida M. Posner has made possible the digitization of
the Posner Memorial Collection. The collection of 622 titles
includes landmark titles in the history of western science,
beautifully produced books on decorative arts, and fine sets of
literature. Examples of volumes of particular importance include
works by Copernicus, Kepler, and a Third Folio of Shakespeare.
Scanning of the Collection will be completed by 2004. As the
digitized books become available, they can be searched and
browsed at the Posner Family Collection, <a
href="http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/">http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/</a>.
Currently only metadata searching is available, but full-text
searching will be provided in 2004. The digitized books are also
being linked to Carnegie Mellon library catalog records.

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>Electronic Reserves</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Carnegie Mellon
University Libraries began offering electronic reserve services
in fall 2000. Brief item records are created in our online
catalog (Sirsi Unicorn) for each title to be put on reserve.
Photocopied items submitted for reserves are scanned into PDF
format and placed on a server. A program runs hourly on the
server to assign each item a URL and then forwards that URL to an
email account. The URLs taken from that account are put into the
856 field of the brief record to create the link to the article
(or other document).</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Users can search
the Reserves module in the library catalog by Instructor Name,
Course Number, or Course Name. Users call up the record for the
item that they need and click the link to view or print the
document. Access to electronic reserves is limited to members of
the Carnegie Mellon community by IP authentication, and WebISO
enables access for remote Carnegie Mellon users. [contact Joan

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>
Patron-Initiated Borrowing (ILLiad and EZBorrow)</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Research indicated
that users on our campus wanted a system of requesting books and
other materials from other libraries that would provide them with
speedy delivery, a great deal of personal control, and access to
information about the progress of their requests.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>We selected ILLiad
as our interlibrary loan management system because it provided
all of those requirements and more. ILLiad is able to take
articles received via Ariel and deliver them to the web, allowing
us true desktop delivery for the first time through ILL. It has
the added benefit of leveling workload across ILL offices in
three library facilities.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>We also
implemented the Pennsylvania Academic Library Consortium, Inc.
(PALCI)&rsquo;s EZBorrow system for patron-initiated circulation.
This allows people to search the catalogs of participating
libraries and place requests for books directly (i.e., quickly).
Supported by a Pennsylvania-wide delivery service, it provides
excellent turnaround time and also allows users to monitor the
status of their requests.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>A link in the
library catalog alerts users to both ILLiad and EZBorrow, and
helps users select which system to use based on their needs.

University Libraries provide public scanning capabilities at all
of its reference locations. This service enables students,
faculty and staff to create, save and retrieve images files using
library materials during the hours of operation at each facility.
In addition, a pay-per-print color laser printer was installed in
the Arts Reference area to accommodate a growing demand for such
a service. [contact Bella Gerlich, <a

<p style='margin-left:.5in'><b>SFX</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Beginning in 2002,
the University Libraries have implemented Ex Libris&rsquo;s SFX
software, which provides links to journal titles provided by
journal publishers and aggregator databases, links to the title
record in the library catalog record, links to journal tables of
contents and full-text articles, and enables cross-linking
between resources (for example, from citations in one resource to
full-text articles in another resource). SFX also supports
interlibrary loan requests via ILLiad. In 2003, SFX functionality
was incorporated into the Automated Reference Assistant (ARA). It
was also used to create a web-based list of the University
Libraries&rsquo; electronic journals; adding the Libraries&rsquo;

Carnegie Mellon usage statistics indicate that the majority of
online catalog and database use occurs by remote access, that is,
from outside library facilities. A drawback of remote access is
that users do not have traditional reference librarians at their
sides to help guide them to relevant and reliable material. The
effect is that users often become confused and overwhelmed when
searching by remote access. The University Libraries sought
funding and developed the Automated Reference Assistant software
to help guide remote users to relevant high-quality information

<b><i>Feasibility Study</i></b> <i>(1999-2000).</i>
Based on a statistically valid random sample of books in the
library catalog, this study was designed to determine the
feasibility of getting copyright permission to digitize books and
provide them free-to-read on the surface web. The study revealed

was too complicated to pursue.</p>

If permission was granted, often restrictions were
applied, for example, restrict access to Carnegie Mellon users
only, provide access to the book for only two years, or pay $300
for permission per title.</p>

<p
style='margin-left:.75in;tab-stops:list .75in'>The overall
success rate in securing copyright permission was 22%. However,
the likelihood of success varied significantly with different
types of publishers, ranging from 45% for scholarly associations
to 12% for commercial publishers.</p>

<b><i>Posner Memorial Collection</i></b>
<i>(2002-2003).</i> A full-time temporary employee was hired to
do the copyright permission work on the Posner Memorial
Collection. A study of the collection and search of the copyright
renewal records revealed that approximately 34% of the books in
the collection are copyright protected. The work is ongoing.
Letters of inquiry are sent to each publisher of copyrighted
titles in the collection, offering them the options of granting
open access to their books on the web, restricting access to the
Carnegie Mellon community only, or (of course) denying permission
to digitize and provide online access to their books. Requests
are for non-exclusive permission to digitize and provide online
access to the books. Typically the initial letter of inquiry does
not get a response from the publisher. However, rather than
sending a second letter, the follow-up is done by telephone or
email. Often copyright has reverted to the author&rsquo;s estate,
so the estate has to be located and contacted.</p>



<p

copyright permission work for the Posner Memorial Collection will
be completed by 2004. As of the end of August 2003, the success

<b><i>Million Book Project</i></b> <i>(2003-2007).</i>
The initial focus of the copyright permission work for the
Million Book Project was to acquire permission to include the
titles cited in <i>Books for College Libraries</i>, which is a
five-volume bibliography of books recommended for all academic
library collections. <i>Books for College Libraries</i> lists
approximately 50,000 titles. The University Libraries quickly
realized that pursuing permission per title was prohibitively
expensive, so a new strategy was needed. The current collection
development strategy for copyrighted works targeted for the
Million Book Collection is to use librarian-selected
bibliographies as approval plans to identify publishers of
quality books. Letters are being sent to publishers of works
cited in the selected bibliographies, beginning with <i>Books for
College Libraries</i>. The letters introduce the Million Book
Project and educate publishers about user behaviors and
preferences and new business models, specifically:</p>

<p
style='margin-left:.75in;tab-stops:list .75in'>As incentive to
participate in the Million Book Project, Carnegie Mellon offers
to give the publishers copies of the digitized books and
accompanying metadata, which they can use in fee-based,
added-value services, for example, a print-on-demand service that
would generate revenue from out-of-print books. Introductory
letters are followed-up with a phone call or visit to the
publisher.</p>



<p
style='margin-left:.75in;tab-stops:list .75in'>This strategy
yields many more books for inclusion in the Million Book
Collection for the same transaction costs incurred to negotiate
permission per title. Using intermittent labor, as of September
1, 2003, letters had been sent to 184 publishers, but few
follow-up calls had been made. The success rate at that time was
4%, with permission granted to include thousands of in-copyright,
out-of-print books in the Million Book Collection.</p>



<p
style='margin-left:.75in;tab-stops:list .75in'>A full time staff
member dedicated to copyright permission work for the Million
Book Project was hired in October 2003. Future copyright
permission work for the Million Book Project will focus on
scholarly associations and university presses because the results
of the feasibility study indicate that these types of publishers
are three to four times more likely to grant permission for open
access than commercial publishers.</p>

Audio Reserves Pilot Project (2001-2003)</b></p>


<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Planning
for Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s digital audio project began in early
2001 with monitoring the Music Library Association&rsquo;s
listserv and a digital audio listserv, gathering correspondence
on digital audio projects. This included various opinions on
software and legal issues. In June 2001, representatives from
Library Instructional Technology and the Arts and Special
Collections unit went to Penn State to speak with the people
responsible for developing and implementing their digital audio
reserves. In fall 2001, preliminary workflows, policies and
procedures for creating, mounting and saving audio e-reserves
files were established. A front-end for the web site was created,
and implementation of an audio e-reserves pilot was ready for the
academic year 2002-2003. Two courses were targeted for testing.
To measure service capabilities, a survey was created and
distributed to the pilot group in spring 2003. Survey results
will dictate changes in procedures/website prior to the
anticipated release and marketing of service availability in
2004. [contact Bella Gerlich, <a

<span style='color:black'>The Carnegie Mellon University
Libraries process uses a freeware program to rip sound files.
Files are saved at 96K, as the difference between 124K and 96 is
indiscernible, and the smaller files allows for easier streaming.
A hyperlink is created using the E-Reserves process currently in
place and inserted into a duplicate &lsquo;reserve&rsquo; record
in the library catalog. The hyperlink launches a web page &amp;
Java applet that was developed in-house that requires a client
run on the user&rsquo;s machine allowing the streaming to run
locally, as opposed to the server sending the stream.</span></p>



<p
style='margin-left:.5in;tab-stops:48.0pt;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none'>
<span style='color:black'>Web statistics collected during the
duration of the pilot study counted the 1,912 successful requests
for Audio-E-Reserves pages. There was an average of five
successful requests for pages per day. In addition to the web
statistics, the respondents to the class survey returned an
overall favorable response to the Audio-E-Reserves option and
service. Faculty who piloted the service were complimentary, and
indicated they would like to use the service for future
classes.</span></p>



<p style='margin-left:.5in'><span
style='color:black'>Problems were experienced late in the trial
when the browsers (Netscape and Explorer) were upgraded
system-wide in library facilities. This problem may be eliminated
with the addition of a new script that would automatically
generate an upgrade as needed, but further research is being done
first in order to implement the best delivery system to the
users. Currently, staff are contacting other peer institutions
and investigating the ROI of continually upgrading the homegrown
product as is versus purchasing and servicing existing streaming
technologies.</span> [contact Bella Gerlich, <a

<p><b>Copyright Permissions Challenges</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Approximately 95%
of the books ever published are still in copyright, but out of
print. These books are neither generating revenue for publishers
nor easily accessible to potential readers who might be willing
to pay for them. During the period when U.S. copyright required
renewal, research shows that fewer than 15% of copyrights were
renewed. Only about 2% of the books published in the 1920s and
1930s have continuing commercial value, yet the Copyright Term
Extension Act of 1998 extended their copyright to at least 2023.
Copyright law and the cost of seeking copyright permission are
among the biggest barriers to creating the digital library.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Primary
difficulties in acquiring copyright permission to digitize
materials include:</p>

Many publisher addresses in <i>Global Books in
Print</i> are incorrect.</p>


<p
style='margin-left:.5in;tab-stops:0in;mso-layout-grid-align: none;text-autospace:none'>
Furthermore, publishers&rsquo; permission departments are very
slow to respond, publishers sometimes cannot find contracts for
titles they published, and publishers are sometimes uncertain
whether their contracts grant them electronic rights.</p>


<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Along with
the above difficulties, publishers have inclinations that impede
acquiring non-exclusive permission to digitize and provide open
access to their works. For example, they are afraid that their
books will lose value or be commercially distributed by someone
other than themselves if they are digitized and made available on
the web. They often want to be paid copyright permission fees or
royalties. [contact: Denise Troll Covey, <a
href="mailto:troll@andrew.cmu.edu">troll@andrew.cmu.edu</a>]</p>

<p><b>Challenges of Collaboration</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:.5in'>As we undertake
collaborative digital projects with colleagues in academia and
the private sector, on campus and around the world, we have
discovered that although we share a vision we also have many
differences that need to be communicated and addressed along the
way. Differences in approach, expectations, understanding and
philosophy must be negotiated among disciplines, and between the
public and private sectors. Differences in bandwidth, in the
broadest sense&mdash;including hardware, software, and the
learning curve for people from various backgrounds who must
understand and use new technologies&mdash;is another constant
that must be anticipated. Handing off projects from one group to
another may result in discomfort, discontinuity and delay. Far
from discouraging collaboration, dealing with the difficult
issues of group work heightens awareness, encourages creativity
and produces better, stronger projects.</p>

<p><b>DOI (Persistent URLs)</b></p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The challenge of
creating persistent URLs to our digital items was met through the
adoption the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) standard. Through
the use of DOI and the creation of software that allows for
simple entry and maintenance of our DOI data, we have created a
