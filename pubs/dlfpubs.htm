Commissioned by DLF Aquifer and supported by a grant from The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, this report was written for metadata specialists, programmers, project planners, and systems architects, and librarians to help them make decisions about how to allocate resources for metadata creation, enhancement, and remediation by examining the feasibility of developing tools into production services for automating the cleanup and enhancement of metadata records.  It is a thoughtful review of commercially and freely available state-of-the-art tools for remediation and enhancement solutions.

With support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, DLF commissioned an environmental scan of traditional moving-image archives, major public and university libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions such as public television broadcasters with significant film and video collections in the United States. The report summarizes which moving-image collections are potentially available for digitization, including a brief enumeration of technical, logistical, organizational, and legal impediments that affect the suitability of these collections for digitization.

From the expense and difficulty of determining copyright status and locating the owner to the struggle to get a response from a publisher when seeking permission to digitize for scholarly use, this timely report provides a detailed account of the challenges facing libraries today. It should be of practical use to publishers and librarians alike as we try to navigate the current situation and work to improve it, through such innovations as the "orphaned works" legislation that is currently under discussion. The lessons learned and reported will inform and aid the rest of us as we wrestle with the same problems.

This report will be useful to anyone interested in the current state of online American literature resources. Its purpose is twofold: to offer a sampling of the types of digital resources currently available or under development in support of American literature; and to identify the prevailing concerns of specialists in the field as expressed during interviews conducted between July 2004 and May 2005. Part two of the report consolidates the results of these interviews with an exploration of resources currently available. Part three examines six categories of digital work in progress: (1) quality-controlled subject gateways, (2) author studies, (3) public domain e-book collections and alternative publishing models, (4) proprietary reference resources and full-text primary source collections, (5) collections by design, and (6) teaching applications. This survey is informed by a selective review of the recent literature.

<br /> [DLF]<br /><br />
This report, commissioned by DLF, provides an overview of a diverse set of more than thirty digital library aggregation services, organizes them into functional clusters, and then evaluates them more fully from the perspective of an informed user. Most of the services under review rely wholly or partially on the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI-PMH).   Each service is annotated with its organizational affiliation, subject coverage, function, audience, status, and size. Critical issues surrounding each of these elements are presented in order to provide the reader with an appreciation of the nuances inherent in seemingly straightforward factual information, such as "audience" or "size."</p>

Digital libraries, once project-based and largely autonomous efforts, are maturing. 
As individual programs have grown, each has developed its own personality, reflecting 
the circumstances of its creation and environment, and its leadership. This report from 
CLIR and DLF draws on the results of a survey and case studies of DLF members to 
reveal how these influences have molded a range of organizational forms that we call 
the digital library. The report is written by Daniel Greenstein and Suzanne Thorin. 
Greenstein, formerly the director of DLF, is now university librarian and director 
of the California Digital Library. Thorin is the dean of university libraries at 
Indiana University.  Section one of the report examines three stages of digital 
library growth: the young digital library, the maturing digital library, and the 
adult digital library. Section two of the report presents case studies of digital 
library development at six institutions.  [Formats: HTML; PDF; Print]</p>

assessment techniques that include surveys, focus groups, user
protocols, and transaction log analysis. Covey's work is also an
essential methodological guidebook. For each method that she
covers, she is careful to supply a definition, explain why and
how libraries use the method, what they do with the results, and
what problems they encounter. The report includes an extensive

descriptions of assessment instruments that have proved
particularly effective. [Formats: HTML; PDF; Print]</p>

As the scholarly information environment changes, so do the needs, expectations,
and behaviors of users. Assessing and responding to those changes
is essential for the academic library so that it may continue in
support of the scholarly mission. The authors of this report have
formally examined how humanities scholars conduct and collate
their research. The study was based on a small sample of
scholars; nonetheless, the results are powerfully suggestive of
ways in which academic libraries can adapt to and develop in a
rapidly changing environment. In particular, the findings
emphasize how important it is for libraries to chart their
evolutionary course in close consultation with scholarly user
communities. This study results from the fruitful
cross-fertilization between the scholar concerned with aspects of
information science and the librarian concerned with delivering
operational information services. [Formats: HTML; PDF; Print]</p>

<br /><br />
In this report, Abby Smith synthesizes the nearly 10 years' experience that libraries have had digitizing items from their rare, special, and general collections, and making them available online. The learning she uncovers is distilled in and extended by several case studies conducted in leading digital libraries with very different digitization programs. Smith demonstrates that digitization programs work best where their role within a library's collection development strategy is clearly understood, and she identifies several roles that such programs can play. Smith also asks a number of searching questions. She muses about the extent to which digitally reformatted special and rare collections can actually support scholarly research. Probing further, she wonders whether leading research libraries in particular might more usefully focus on digitizing general as opposed to special and rare collections. In this way, they would make important holdings available in new ways while taking a first step in avoiding costs associated with their redundant management. The report is consequently much more than a strategic guide for individual institutions; it is a route map that points important directions for the library community as a whole.

identifies and synthesizes existing practices used in developing
collections of free third-party Internet resources that support
higher education and research. A review of these practices and
the projects they support confirms that developing collections of
free Web resources is a process that requires its own set of
practices, policies, and organizational models. Where possible,
the report recommends those practices, policies, and models that
have proved to be particularly effective in terms of
sustainability, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and
applicability to their stated purpose. The report outlines the
similarities and differences between print and free Web resources
and describes how the nature and complexity of free Web resources
