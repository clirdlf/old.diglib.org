<p class=MsoNormal><b>National Digital Library Program</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since its beginning in 1994, the Library of Congress
National Digital Library Program (NDLP) has been a premier national resource
for noncommercial, high-quality intellectual content on the Internet. More than
8.5 million items from the Library’s collections are now available to users
anywhere anytime from the Library of Congress Web site at http://www.loc.gov
.The site, one of the federal government’s most popular, handles more than 100
million transactions every month, including 47 million visits each month to the
American Memory collections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
  style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>America</span></span><span style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>’s Library is a
Web site designed for children and families. The site combines kid-friendly
graphics with the incomparable American historical collections of the Library
in more than 1,000 stories about our nation’s past. America’s Library invites
users to learn through multimedia materials that have rarely been on view.
These materials include cartoons, baseball cards, early “special effects”
captured on film, photographs, maps, prints, manuscripts, and audio and video
recordings. Interactive elements such as a “Scavenger Hunt” and “Send a
Postcard” encourage exploration of the site, and animated “teasers” on the main
home page will delight users of all ages. Questions invite children to talk to
their family and friends about what they have learned. During fiscal year 2003 America’s Library received an average of more than 15 million visits per month. Individual
collections include: Meet Amazing Americans; Jump Back in Time; Explore the
States; Join America at Play; and See, Hear and Sing.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The American Memory Web site continued
to receive wide acclaim as a provider of free, high quality, educationally
valuable American cultural and historical resources. At the end of 2003, more

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>Designed for teachers, the Learning
Page is a companion Web site to the American Memory collections. It provides
search and curricular guidance to teachers and students who use American Memory
primary source materials. Throughout 2002 and 2003, the Learning Page was
redesigned to enhance usability. Nine new lesson plans, designed by educators
who have participated in the Library’s American Memory Fellows Program, were
made available, bringing the total number of lesson plans on the page to 80.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Learning Page’s Immigration feature
presentation continued to add major sections of content that demonstrate how
various ethnic groups shaped America. A Community Center was implemented as an
interactive section of the site. Eleven discussion themes were introduced. In
addition, eight interactive activities were created for teachers’ use with
their students, and seven Collection Connections were added to provide
activities for using the Library’s digital materials in the classroom.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Learning Page also supports the
National Digital Library teacher-training initiative and other educational
outreach efforts available to all educators with Internet access. Nineteen
workshops from the National Digital Library teacher-training initiatives are
now available on the Learning Page, as well as a conference page of national
and local presentations by Library staff and teachers working with the Library
of Congress initiative and descriptive indexes and reservation forms for
workshops given in the National Digital Library Learning Center at the Library
of Congress. A page of downloadable handouts for teachers was added. A
quarterly electronic newsletter, The Source, written by teachers and school
media specialists, is published on the Learning Page through collaboration with
the Social Science Education Consortium.</span></span></p>

2000, Congress directed the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress
to develop and coordinate a program to collect and preserve at the Library the
audio and video recorded oral histories and documentary materials such as
diaries and letters of America’s 19 million war veterans. The Library works
closely with interested groups, such as veterans organizations, to coordinate
the project and make the collections available to the public, including online
presentations. AARP (formerly American Association for Retired Persons) has
provided generous partial funding for the project. Audio and visual (moving and
still images and text) files of veterans’ oral histories are available online,
alphabetically under each veteran or grouped under the themes of:</span></span></p>

was appointed as the Library’s first Associate Librarian for Strategic
Initiatives (ALSI) in October 2000 (start of fiscal 2001) to develop a full
range of digital policies and operations for acquiring, describing and
preserving content created and distributed in electronic form and for
life-cycle management of digital materials as part of the Library’s universal
collection for the nation. Ms. Campbell retains her title as NDLP director and
is also Chief Information Officer for the Library of Congress, with
responsibility for oversight of the office of Information Technology Services

Team/QuestionPoint</span></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Digital Reference Team handles the
reference support for the digital collections and the Library’s digital
reference initiative. After the inauguration of the Ask A Librarian service in
June 2002, the team provides both text-based and chat service via direct access
from the Library’s Web site. The team continues to test and build the knowledge
base that is available to QuestionPoint member libraries and a global network.
To this end the team has answered over 14,000 inquires and conducted 1600 live
chat sessions.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>Additionally the Digital Reference
Team designs and presents demonstrations, on-site workshops, and video
conferences for a wide audience. Opportunities for video conferencing and
webcasting are continually expanding with 2,800 college and K/12 educators and
students participating in 90 video conferences in the past year. Two new video
conferences are “The Spy Map and George Washington” and “Gathering Your
Community’s Stories.”</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span

Service Collections Directorate received the 2003 Virtual Reference Desk
Director’s Award for its role in founding QuestionPoint, which evolved from the
Collaborative Digital Reference Service, a collaboration to provide reference
service anywhere, anytime using the Internet. QuestionPoint is now a
subscription service hosted by OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc., with
more than 800 member libraries.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Law Library of Congress’s primary
digital initiative, the Global Legal Information Network (GLIN) is an online
parliament-to-parliament cooperative exchange that has made the laws and legal
materials (often in the vernacular) of forty-eight nations available via the
Internet. In fiscal 2003, there were about 1.7 million visits to the GLIN
online database.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Law Library of Congress contracted
with the General Services Administration to perform a major technical upgrade
of the GLIN system in 2004.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>An ongoing project adds retrospective
laws to GLIN for the countries of Latin America, covering the period from 1975
through 1995, by scanning the microfilm of official gazettes and producing PDF
files. About 28,0000 full texts of laws from nineteen Latin American countries
have thus been linked in the GLIN database.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>The Law Library continued to review

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span

process more than 50,000 requests for interlibrary loans. In March 2001 all
interlibrary loan requests to the Library began to be funneled through a single
computer gateway, ILL Manager, purchased from RLG. The software channels requests
from libraries using OCLC, RLIN, and the Library of Congress Web into a single
workstream. By October 2003, the Collections Access, Loan and Management
Division had digitized and delivered over the Web more than 150 small, fragile
pamphlets requested by ILL patrons. The Library has also committed to capturing
the content of scanned items through OCR of the PDF files. Access to the OCR
files is currently being explored.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>This recently approved project will
improve access to approximately 2,000 pre-1970 Congressional hearings,
improving service to the Congress. Other benefits to be derived include
central, as opposed to dispersed availability of the hearings, better access to
the content of the items, improved cataloging describing these hearings, and
the addition of other information concerning alternate data source
availability. The methodology to be employed consists of identifying and
retrieving approximately 2,000 items, reclassifying them into class KF in the
Law schedule and upgrading the cataloging for the items. In addition, the
project will arrange to make digital copies available for hearings in poor
physical condition.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>ONIX (ONline Information eXchange) is
a means of representing book industry product information, used by some
publishers today to communicate that data electronically. The Library receives
these data directly, and with programming developed by BEAT, the project
creates Table of Contents (TOC) and Publisher Description records that the
Library makes available on the Web. Hyper-links are made from this TOC data to
the catalog record, and the reverse, thus allowing researchers to move from or
to the Library's Online Catalog where they can make additional searches for
related or other material. To date the project has created about 43,000 ONIX
TOC records and 64,000 ONIX Descriptions records.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>BEAT staff plan to link images of dust
jackets to titles in the ONIX Descriptions and ONIX TOC initiatives. Initially,
there will be links to approximately 2,300 dust jacket images, and it is
anticipated that the number will grow as publishers can provide that data
through existing BEAT channels. This further enriches the data that LC provides
to searchers about cataloged materials. This project was to be implemented in
2004.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>In a new aspect of this project, using
programming by three BEAT Team members, a Web-based TOC is created for
virtually all ECIP records that contain TOC data. A hot-link in the TOC file is
made to and then from the underlying record in the LC Online Catalog. The
programs handle most diacritical marks, and also enrich the TOC Web display by
adding such LC subject headings as were applied by cataloging staff. In
addition to this new development, table of contents data are added in about 30
percent of the bibliographic records by staff in the course of the regular ECIP
cataloging process. As of December 2003, approximately 12,000 ECIP TOC records
had been added to the Web server.</span></span></p>

been made publicly available through the Library. The texts to which LC was
granted permission to link are mostly recent imprints and current scholarship,
whereas prior Public Domain projects were for retrospective material primarily
of historical value. In another addition to this project, BEAT has added links

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:72.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>To enrich access to scholarly
materials, BEAT has begun to link catalog records for selected materials in the
Library's collections to reviews for them in <i>H-Net Reviews in the Humanities
and Social Sciences</i>, the online journal of H-NET: Humanities and Social
Sciences Online, a resource that contains many scholarly and academic reviews.
The reviews cover contemporary publications as well as classic publications in
a variety of academic fields. Many of the reviews, in addition to containing
relevant Library of Congress subject headings, include footnotes and
bibliographies. The initial phase of the cooperative project resulted in 6,173
links from Library of Congress catalog records to corresponding H-Net reviews.
An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 additional reviews will be added each year.</span></span></p>

Enhanced Citations with Indexes, Tables of contents, Electronic resources and
Sources cited) enhances staff- produced bibliographies, and the catalog records
for the titles included in such bibliographies, by adding links to their tables
of contents, indexes, and sources cited. Another recent initiative has been the
scanning and conversion to text of heavily used, but out-of- print guides to
Library of Congress collections whose individual items are not easily
identified in the Library’s Online Catalog. The project uses scanning and OCR
to substantially enrich these traditional printed bibliographies. Links in the
catalog records are made for each type of data file created for the work in
question as well as between all the related files for any work for which a Web
file is included. Completed works within this project include guides on
business history, African American business, Thomas Jefferson, and materials on
Immigrant Arrivals to the United States. A number of additional works are in
progress, covering additional business resources, guides to microfilm
collections, three guides to Prints and Photographs Division collections,
manuscript collections from several Middle Eastern monasteries, and a guide to
Ladino publications in the Library of Congress.</span></span></p>

with WebArchivist.org of the State University of New York Institute of
Technology and the Internet Archive, with additional funding from The Pew
Charitable Trusts through the University of Washington Center for Communication
and Civic Engagement. The Election 2002 Web Archive is a selective collection
of nearly 3,000 sites archived between July 1, 2002 and November 30, 2002.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

included Web sites produced by congressional and gubernatorial candidates, and
featured a unique “Drill search” interface developed with WebArchivist.org,
allowing access to Web Archive Records and archived sites. In July 2003, the
Library of Congress began hosting the archive directly from LC servers
(previous collections had been temporarily hosted by the Internet Archive).</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

Archive, webArchivists.org and the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project,
launched a September 11 Web Archive. This new archive preserves the Web
expressions of individuals, groups, the press and institutions in the United States and from around the world in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

the 107<sup>th</sup> Congress and the War in Iraq. Collection-level AACR2/MARC
catalog records were created for each thematic Web site collected in order to
represent these items in the LC ILS. Building upon traditional methods, we are
in the process of supplementing the collection level metadata by experimenting
with the creation of title-level descriptive metadata for each Web site within
the collection using the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS).</span></span></p>

Ameritech Corporation to enable public, research and academic libraries,
museums, historical societies and archival institutions (with the exception of
federal institutions) to digitize American history collections and to make them
available on the Library’s American Memory Web site. Those digital collections
complement and enhance the Library’s online resources. Thirty-three

(NLS), Library of Congress, completed the five-year development phase of
digital talking book technology during fiscal year 2003 and began the
conversion phase to implement the new digital talking books and playback
machines by 2008. To ensure that NLS/BPH has an adequate store of digital
materials available when it begins its transition from analog to digital
distribution, all contractors producing audio books for NLS/BPH have been given
a schedule for converting their studios, culminating in 100 percent digital
mastering in fiscal 2004.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

players ready for initial distribution. The first request for proposals (RFP),
including detailed specifications on procurement and quality assurance, has
been issued. Contractors will begin producing DTBs according to those
specifications in 2004. Conversion of 10,000 of the 40,000 analog recorded
catalog titles to DTB format is planned, and an RFP for the pilot conversion of
200 titles has been issued. NLS also sponsored the development of a system
whereby network libraries can duplicate analog cassettes from digital masters
and convert analog recordings to digital format. It is currently defining the
hardware and software needed to manage book files during recording and quality
assurance.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

electronic copies of the books they produced. Those books and all new braille
books and magazines are now available to users online through the Web-Braille
system. Web-Braille allows access to more than 5,900 digital braille book
files, twenty-six national magazines, and six national sports schedules. At the
close of fiscal 2003, more than 3,000 users were registered for this Internet
service. The NLS <i>International Union Catalog</i> for braille and audio
materials also linked to Web-Braille. As a result, Web-Braille books could be

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:
none'>The digital explosion has imposed on the Library of Congress a new
mission-critical workload and the need to expand high-quality, free online
services to the Congress, K-12 educators, and the American public. This work
must be carried out in conjunction with the Library’s equally critical
traditional services of acquiring, cataloging, preserving, serving and storing
artifactual materials. The Library of Congress must continue to construct
digital-repository architecture and basic technology infrastructure to preserve
current and future digital assets. As the Library’s vast multiformat
collections grow, it must continue to invest in securing and preserving these
cultural records. The Library’s ability to launch, deliver, preserve and secure
digital content and services for the Congress and public depends on
congressional support.</span></span></p>

organizational and cultural factors and issues of responsibility.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>Intellectual property rights are
critical. There is confusion about copyright and what partner institutions can
and cannot do under the law.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span

involved all service and support units. Computer security awareness training
was made part of mandatory staff training. The National Security Agency
performed a risk assessment of the Library of Congress network and digital
assets held by Information Technology Services, and audits of Library of
Congress servers were initiated.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;text-decoration:
none'>Threat surveillance and selective dissemination of alerts and advisories
have been extended to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The enterprise
firewall has been upgraded, including stronger encryption standards. Library of
Congress systems engineering staff designed and constructed an Alternate
Computing Facility that mirrors the Library’s high priority applications. All
enterprise-level digital data are remotely stored in backup tapes, and all
primary servers, storage, and backup systems are replicated at the Alternate
Computing Facility to ensure continuity of service and data security in the
