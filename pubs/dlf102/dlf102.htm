      <blockquote>The Digital Library Federation (DLF) is a consortium of thirty-three members and five allied organizations that are pioneering
         the use of electronic information technologies to extend library collections and services. We pride ourselves on our ability
         to concentrate the talent of our librarians and technologists on issues of shared importance. The Electronic Resources Management
         Initiative (ERMI) is one such collaboration and has proved to be a timely and wide-reaching endeavor, finding a ready audience
         in libraries, systems vendors, and standards organizations.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>The problem this initiative addresses is a pervasive one: when libraries acquire licensed electronic resources, they must
         comprehend, transmit, and inform others about the many financial, legal, and access aspects of these arrangements. The acquisitions
         and licensing processes are complex-publishers transmit this information to libraries in a variety of paper and electronic
         formats, and the number of licensed electronic products that libraries are collecting is increasing rapidly. Such situations
         tend to spawn local, ad hoc fixes. By contrast, the DLF ERMI has created a coordinated solution, developing the common specifications
         found in this important publication for the management of license agreements, related administrative information, and the
         internal processes associated with licensed electronic resources.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>Even when it was in draft form, response to this work has been swift and gratifying.  Major vendors of library systems have
         been informed by the recommendations of the ERMI report as they design license management capacities into their software suites.
         The developers of ONIX, the metadata scheme used widely by academic and trade publishers,  are looking closely at adopting
         ERMI as they consider their license expression needs, and the United Kingdom's national serials union catalogue (SUNCAT) is
         testing ERMI as it seeks to express and store licenses within this developing national service.

      <blockquote>As libraries have worked to incorporate electronic resources into their collections, services, and operations, most of them
         have found that their existing integrated library systems (ILSs) are not capable of supporting these new resources. A 2001
         study by Jewell<a href="#note01"> [1]</a>  determined that a number of libraries had begun developing local systems to overcome these shortcomings. The Digital Library
         Federation (DLF) Electronic Resource Management Initiative (ERMI) was organized to support the rapid development of such systems
         by producing a series of interrelated documents to define needs and to help establish data standards.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>A National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and DLF workshop in May 2002 led to the creation of a steering group
         that would guide the development of the ERMI. In addition, the DLF invited librarians, library-system vendors, and representatives
         of related organizations to serve on two project advisory groups. The steering group shared draft versions of the documents
         it was developing with members of these two reactor panels. The drafts were also made publicly available via Cornell University's
         Web Hub for Developing Administrative Metadata for Electronic Resource Management (available from <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/cts/elicensestudy/">http://www.library.cornell.edu/cts/elicensestudy/</a>).
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>This publication contains the report and appendixes developed by the steering committee during the course of its work. The
         report itself is intended to serve as a road map for electronic resource management (ERM). It outlines ERM system needs and
         discusses and illustrates screens from systems that are already in place at such institutions as the Massachusetts Institute
         of Technology (MIT), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). Appendix A summarizes
         in detail some 50 functional requirements of an effective ERM. Appendix B provides a diagram that outlines some differences
         between workflows for print and electronic resources. This appendix also contains diagrams for more specific phases of the
         e-resource life cycle.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote>Appendixes C, D, and E are closely linked. Appendix C is an entity-relationship diagram that illustrates how groups of data
         elements relate to one another. Appendix D is a data dictionary encompassing more than 300 elements. Appendix E covers data
         structure, grouping the data elements by entity and keying them to the functional requirements. The concluding XML investigation
         discusses and compares some existing rights expression languages (RELs). It notes that while it is desirable for libraries,
         publishers, and vendors to have a standardized, XML-based way to describe key terms of license agreements, no current RELs
         or schemas seem practical or usable without major modification. To fill this need, the authors propose creation of a <i>native</i> ERM schema based on the ERMI data dictionary.

         <h2>1. Introduction: The Need for Comprehensive Electronic Resource Management Systems</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>A few years ago, Cornell University Libraries' strategic plan included the bold and startling prediction of a "mostly digital
         environment" for that library system by 2005 (Cornell Libraries 2000). Whether or not this prediction proves to be accurate
         for Cornell or would apply to most other libraries, it is clear from Association of Research Libraries (ARL) expenditure-trend
         data that spending for electronic resources (e-resources) has been growing much more rapidly than have the materials budgets
         of which such resources are usually a part. In the 2001-2002 academic year, at least a few ARL libraries were already spending
         half their materials budgets for e-resources (ARL 2002, 2003). Libraries are in the midst of a profound shift toward reliance
         on e-resources, and this reliance seems to have deepened within the last year or two as libraries have shed paper journal
         subscriptions to help pay for online access.
      </p>
      
      <p>Meanwhile, user behavior and attitudes seem to be changing even more quickly. For example, nearly half of the undergraduates
         surveyed by Outsell, Inc., for a recent study of the scholarly information environment indicated that they used e-resources
         either exclusively or almost exclusively (Friedlander 2002). That study also showed that many faculty and graduate students
         would like to see more journals available to them electronically. However, as many librarians can attest, demand for expanded
         access to e-resources is only part of the story. Users now compare their libraries' services to such recent innovations as
         the Google search engine and Amazon.com, and they expect libraries to provide similar levels of simplicity, power, and convenience.
      </p>
      
      <p>These developments provide the context for what many librarians find to be a daunting and increasingly complex challenge:
         successfully managing their collections of e-resources. In an earlier study of DLF-member library practices, Jewell (2001)
         identified some noteworthy trends in how these libraries selected and acquired licensed e-resources and presented information
         about them to users. Perhaps of greatest importance for the present discussion, most of the responding DLF libraries had found
         that their existing ILSs were incapable of supporting these functions and had begun to design and build local automated tools
         to fill the gaps.
      </p>
      
      <p>One fundamental management problem that some of these systems were meant to address is the need to describe larger and larger
         numbers of bibliographic databases and to present that information to users. Another challenge lies in the nature and characteristics
         of some of the new resources. For example, most libraries now spend significant amounts of money on <i>aggregator</i> databases. Available from companies such as EBSCO, Gale, LexisNexis, and ProQuest, these databases provide access to the
         contents or partial contents of large numbers of periodicals. Although such collections often provide substantial benefits,
         reliably and routinely determining which journals they provide--for what periods of time, in what format, and with what degree
         of currency or completeness--has been an elusive goal. The growth of electronic journals (e-journals) and databases has heightened
         this problem while complicating and transforming the processes associated with acquiring and servicing library materials.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The 2001 DLF report cited above noted that users were often presented with special alphabetical or subject lists of e-resources
         to help meet this descriptive or resource-discovery need. Aggregator databases had become a staple within this group, and
         many of the libraries had begun to experiment with listing their contents along with subscribed e- journals. Since the research
         for the DLF report was conducted, companies such as Serials Solutions, TDNet, and EBSCO have begun to offer services aimed
         at filling these needs, but few ILSs that can fully support or interact with them have become available. In recent years,
         libraries have also begun linking their indexing and full-text resources through proprietary database vendor solutions and
         broader, standards-based tools  Ex Libris's SFX, thus not only providing greater user convenience but also adding a layer
         of complexity to the management of e-resources.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other changes that are much less visible to users have also been taking place. As e-resources have become pervasive, formal
         license agreements have come to supplement or supersede copyright law as the basis for defining and determining their appropriate
         use. Despite the welcome and promising appearance of model licenses (Cox 2000; Council on Library and Information Resources
         2001) and other efforts to standardize license terms, libraries have been investing substantial time and effort in the review
         and negotiation of license terms. Local license negotiations may become complex and protracted, involving staff at multiple
         levels of both licensor and licensee organizations. As a result, some libraries had begun making special efforts to track
         the status of a particular negotiation, describe its important license terms, and present those terms to users and staff.
      </p>
      
      <p>At the same time, libraries have been entering into complex, consortium-based purchasing arrangements with other libraries.
         These arrangements are characterized by ongoing financial commitments and new communication, evaluation, and decision-making
         processes. Once acquired, these resources must be supported through specialized skills and new kinds of information. Recognizing
         the complexity of some resources and user expectations for convenience, some libraries have begun to provide instructional
         and other specialized information directly to their users via their Web sites.
      </p>
      
      <p>Another defining facet of the new electronic environment revealed in the 2001 DLF study is that large numbers of staff from
         disparate units of larger libraries had begun playing new and important specialized roles in the selection, support, and evaluation
         of e-resources. Most of these staff had needs for a wide range of specialized information. For example, staff members in different
         areas might need to know the status of a given resource within the local acquisition and licensing process. Others might need
         to know access details, whether access problems related to a particular resource had arisen, and who was involved in what
         specific troubleshooting activities. Several libraries were also implementing planned, cyclical reviews of their e-resources,
         and--with that in mind--beginning to systematically gather and report all available information on their use.

         <h2>2. Current Efforts to Create Electronic Resource Management Systems</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>Libraries' emerging interest in ERM systems prompted Jewell and Adam Chandler at Cornell to establish in 2001 a Web <i>hub</i> to exchange information about local systems and foster communication among interested librarians. As local systems were identified,
         librarians involved in developing them were systematically asked about their systems' functions and data elements, and the
         elements were analyzed and summarized in the DLF report previously mentioned (Jewell 2001, p. 26). Seven functional areas
         were identified: listing and descriptive, license-related, financial and purchasing, process and status, systems and technical,
         contact and support, and usage. Informal discussions were also begun concerning the value of standardizing functional descriptions,
         element names, and definitions to support these functions.
      </p>
      
      <p>Within a year or two, some 20 libraries and vendors had announced that they had produced or were planning to produce such
         systems (table 1).

      <p>Each system developed by a library reflects particular local requirements and development constraints, and many systems exhibit
         creative and noteworthy features. Rather than provide an exhaustive review of these systems, this discussion  focuses on features
         of just a few of them. Its purpose is to begin to identify elements of an ideal, but achievable, system for managing e-resources.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Libraries' ERLIC (Electronic Resources Licensing and Information Center), established
         in 1999, is a good example of a system that was designed to address a fairly limited need but whose functions have been expanded
         substantially (Penn State Libraries 2001). Developed using Microsoft Access to track the status of orders and to anticipate
         renewals, ERLIC, and now ERLIC2, have evolved into centralized sources of ordering, access, authentication, and licensing
         information (Stanley et al. 2000; Alan 2002). The MIT Libraries' VERA (Virtual Electronic Resource Access) system was developed
         about the same time as Penn State's and also exhibits a wide spectrum of functions (Duranceau 2000a; Duranceau 2000b; Hennig
         2002). It offers both extensive support for "back-office" staff functions and requirements and numerous noteworthy public
         Web page-design features. Yale University's schematized treatment and public presentation of license terms serves as an interesting
         supplement to MIT's approach to the same problem.
      </p>
      
      <p>Like ERLIC and VERA, UCLA's ERDb system was developed to provide a wide range of functionality. While its functionality and
         screen designs are of substantial interest and will be explored in the following pages, related working documents (Farb 2002)
         also articulate useful guidelines that could be generally applied to ERM-system development. Under these guidelines, a system
         should
      </p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* accommodate growth</li>
         
         <li>* design for flexibility</li>
         
         <li>* be offered "one database, but many views"</li>
         
         <li>* avoid unnecessary duplication</li>
         
         <li>* be capable of phased implementation</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>Similarly broad in scope is JHU's HERMES, which stands for Hopkins Electronic Resource Management System (Cyzyk and Robertson
         2003).  Based on PostgreSQL and Cold Fusion, HERMES has recently been made available on an open-source basis. While intended
         to support such functions as the dynamic generation of public Web pages, HERMES is of special interest because of the careful
         analysis of staff roles, workflows, and associated functional requirements that have gone into it. Also worthy of mention
         is Gold Rush, developed by the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (Stockton and Machovec 2001). Gold Rush was the first
         commercially available system to incorporate substantial functionality for e-resource subscription management. Reasonably
         priced and offering support both for individual libraries and library consortia, Gold Rush enables a central consortium administrator
         to "push" out to member libraries a record with a range of information pertaining to an e-resource.

         <h2>3. Functions and Examples</h2>
      </center>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>3.1. A LIFE CYCLE-BASED OVERVIEW</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Records management has been defined as the "systematic control of all organizational records during the various stages of
         their lifecycle: from their creation or receipt, through their processing, distribution, maintenance and use, to their ultimate
         disposition" (Robek et al. 1996). Effective management of e-resources depends on the execution of a wide range of functions
         that follow a slightly different life cycle. For example, while libraries at present generally do not have to deal with the
         creation of licensed e-resources, they do need to evaluate new products and services, and there are other fairly close parallels
         between a simplified records management life cycle model and one for e-resources.
      </p>
      
      <p>Table 2 outlines many of the tasks involved in managing e-resources and the staff who may be involved in different life cycle
         phases. The table is based on the functions and reports available to staff users of HERMES and largely follows the DLF Electronic
         Resource Management Initiative (ERMI) workflow sequence (see Appendix B).The column headings refer to five roles that Hopkins
         staff play in the process: <i>selector</i> and <i>superselector</i>, <i>acquisitions administrator</i>, <i>library computing systems administrator</i>, and <i>public display administrator</i>. Each of these roles is described in the following paragraphs.
      </p>
      
      <p>1. Product consideration and trial process. At JHU, a selector is responsible for identifying a resource, determining whether
         a trial is necessary, and gathering preliminary license information. The acquisitions administrator is responsible for negotiating
         a trial license, if needed. The selector recommends whether to proceed following a trial, which the superselector then approves
         or disapproves. Additional details, such as trial URLs, passwords, and publicity, are established and recorded during this
         phase.
      </p>
      
      <p>2. Acquisition processes. These processes involve three fairly distinct subprocesses that  may take place simultaneously.
         At JHU, the acquisitions administrator is responsible for license negotiation and for entry of related information into HERMES,
         and  the computing services administrator determines technical feasibility and gives or withholds permission to proceed. Remaining
         tasks, also the responsibility of the acquisitions administrator, relate to funding and purchase.
      </p>
      
      <p>3. Implementation. During this phase, authentication details are worked out and recorded, any necessary database configuration
         is performed, and the resource and any appropriate components are cataloged and incorporated  into public Web pages. The descriptive
         tasks during this phase can be difficult and time-consuming, particularly if the resource in question is an e-journal or aggregator
         package containing large numbers of journals or other content. Public Web page presentations can be provided in a number of
         ways and, as will be shown later, could include the provision to staff and users of information about licensing terms. It
         may also be necessary to make the resource known to a link resolver or proxy server.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>4. Product maintenance and review. One of the important tasks within this phase is subscription renewal, which can be triggered
         by date-configurable reminders to staff and could involve price or license-term renegotiation. Another task is maintenance
         of the holdings, or <i>coverage</i>, information encountered during the implementation phase. Additional tasks that could figure in the renewal process include
         acquiring and making usage data available to staff and identifying and resolving problems relating to access and other technical
         issues.

      <h4>3.2.1. Product Consideration and Trial Processes</h4>
      
      <p>The preceding life cycle, task, and role inventory may not correspond closely with the screen displays that staff actually
         see when using ERM systems or their derivatives. For example, the functions listed on table 2 could be reorganized and presented
         according to staff role--as they are within the HERMES. This underscores the value of one of UCLA's aforementioned design
         principles: "One database, many views." Another example of multiple views and an alternative organization of similar information
         is this screen from MIT's VERA (figure 1).

      </p>
      
      <p>In this view, information from different life cycle phases, such as acquisition (purchase order number and vendor), implementation
         (URL, location), and product maintenance and review (renewal date, technical support contact, information about usage data)
         is presented together, presumably because the staff who use this screen need to see it  simultaneously.

      <p>Figure 2 shows a view from UCLA's ERDb system. Called a Resource Screen, it includes information relevant to multiple e-resource
         life cycle phases. In addition to basic identifying or descriptive information that will be useful and used throughout the
         resource life cycle, selection information (e.g., sponsoring unit and selector), as well as acquisitions information (e.g.,
         vendor and purchase order number) can be seen.

         the <i>licensor</i>, or <i>negotiator</i>, for UCLA and a link to a redacted version of the relevant license, this screen provides space for a detailed analysis of
         the specific rights and other details included in the license.

      <h4>3.2.2. Implementation Processes and Public Web Pages: Alphabetical and Subject Presentations</h4>
      
      <p>Libraries commonly present users with multiple routes to licensed resources, including OPAC catalog entries, alphabetical
         and subject Web page listings, e-reserve links, and links connecting index or abstract entries to the corresponding full text.
         The mechanisms used to provide these presentations are generally hidden from public view. Figure 4 shows what UCLA users encounter
         when they follow a link from the library's gateway page to Online Materials.

      </p>
      
      <p>As many other libraries do, UCLA distinguishes between e-journals and article databases. Accordingly, those distinctions need
         to be made within its database. UCLA's alphabetical and subject presentations (figures 5 and 6, respectively) are similar
         to those of many other libraries.

      <p>Helping drive and support these presentations is information gathered and maintained via the ERDb Title View (figure 7), such
         as the basic bibliographic data for the resource. Another view, to be released shortly, relates the component titles of a
         particular e-journal package to a parent record that is necessary for a number of functions, such as linking license terms
         to particular titles. The Title View also enables the association of a resource with both Subjects (figure 8) and Types of
         Resources (figure 9).

      <h4>3.2.3. Implementation Processes and Public Web Pages: Extended Information</h4>
      
      <p>Like UCLA's ERDb system, MIT's VERA is used to generate subject (figure 10) and alphabetical (figure 11) Web pages for databases
         and e-journals. VERA is also used to describe e-resource availability by specific location and to manage and generate resource-specific
         URLs.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408010.jpg"></p>
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408011.jpg"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The way in which VERA incorporates and presents a wide range of other information using special-purpose icons is especially
         noteworthy (see the lower left corner of fig. 11). For example, the "Go" button indicates that a resource is available to
         the MIT community from off-campus, the "?" icon leads to search tips and other documentation, and the "C" icon leads to information
         about upcoming classes on using the specific resource. The universal "Not" symbol also indicates the existence of resource-specific
         access problems. Of even greater interest is the way in which VERA incorporates license information. In addition to the generic
         message about appropriate and inappropriate use of resources that precedes the resource list, the "L" icon indicates when
         more specific license-related information is available. For example, figure 11 shows an entry for the Abstracts of the Papers
         Communicated to the Royal Society of London--provided by JSTOR. The "L" icon leads the user to a summary of key provisions
         of the JSTOR license (fig. 12) that governs its use.

      </p>
      
      <p>Yale University Library's public e-resource pages also integrate instructional and licensing information in clear and understandable
         ways. For example, figure 13 shows an alphabetical listing of databases in the social sciences, including Academic Universe.

         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408013.jpg"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>When users click on the Academic Universe entry, they are taken to the display of additional information shown in figure 14,
         which includes a group of Help tools as well as a link to Permitted Uses of Databases.

      </p>
      
      <p>The Permitted Uses of Databases link takes users to the appropriate section of a lengthy document summarizing permitted uses
         for many or most of the library's licensed resources (fig. 15).

      </p>
      
      <p>This presentation is noteworthy for at least three reasons. First, the resources' licenses have been analyzed to determine
         their provisions in eight key areas, with a simple "yes" or "no" indicating whether or not a particular use is permitted.
         Second, the summary grid provides space to expand where needed on any of the key terms. Third, the presentation allows for
         a link to the full Terms and Conditions. In this case, the link takes users to the LexisNexis Web page (fig. 16), but it could
         just as easily take them to a locally digitized version of an institution-specific license.

      </p>
      
      <p>An interesting contrast to the MIT and Yale license-information presentations is provided by the simple Terms of Use section
         from the Colorado Alliance's Gold Rush Staff Toolbox (fig. 17). Whereas MIT's and Yale's summaries are designed for use by
         those library systems alone, Gold Rush can provide summary license terms to all libraries sharing the system and particular
         resources.

      <h4>3.2.4. Product Maintenance and Review</h4>
      
      <p>Once access to a product has been established and its availability made known to staff and users, any number of problems may
         arise. For example, a vendor or another information provider may need to take a product offline for brief or extended periods
         for planned maintenance or to correct unanticipated technical difficulties. Occasionally, vendor files of a subscriber's IP
         addresses may fail to reflect recent changes or become corrupted, and this will affect access to subscribed services. Delays
         in product invoicing and payment may lead to outages, especially at the beginning of a month. These problems may manifest
         themselves in a variety of ways, such as prompts for usernames and passwords or other messages that may be difficult to understand.
         Still more vexing may be that an access problem related to a particular publisher's package of e- journals or an aggregator
         service can affect all its component journals--entries for which may be dispersed through an online catalog or Web list of
         journals available online.
      </p>
      
      <p>When any of these circumstances arise, it may be difficult or impossible for a library to effectively manage communication
         with staff and affected users. One promising approach to staff communication is shown in figure 18, which depicts a Status
         screen from UCLA's ERDb system. The upper half of this screen displays basic information about the resource in question, while
         the lower half provides space to record information about a reported incident, such as a user's name, IP address, Internet
         service provider, and browser; a description of the problem; the action required; and the present status of the problem.

      </p>
      
      <p>Another approach to communicating problems such as some of those mentioned above is shown in figure 19, which is a mock-up
         of a Billboard function envisioned for Penn State's ERLIC2. This feature would allow users or staff to quickly identify any
         resources to which access was likely to be a problem at a particular time.

         <h2>4. The DLF ERM Initiative</h2>
      </center>
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>4.1. BACKGROUND: EVOLUTION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PROJECT</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The project that eventually became the DLF ERMI began with the Web hub developed by Jewell and Chandler. At the time the hub
         was created, the ALCTS Technical Services Directors of Large Research Libraries Discussion Group developed an interest in
         ERM and agreed to sponsor an informal meeting on the topic at the June 2001 American Library Association (ALA) annual conference.
         That meeting attracted some 40 librarians and led to further discussions of functions and data elements. Shortly thereafter,
         an informal steering group was formed that included Jewell, Chandler, Sharon Farb and Angela Riggio from UCLA, Nathan Robertson
         from JHU, Ivy Anderson from Harvard, and Kimberly Parker from Yale. This group worked with Patricia Harris and Priscilla Caplan
         at NISO and Daniel Greenstein (then at the DLF). These individuals undertook discussions of possible standards that ultimately
         led to the presentation of a NISO/DLF Workshop on Standards for Electronic Resource Management in May 2002. The workshop was
         attended by approximately 50 librarians and representatives from a number of vendors and publishers, including EBSCO, Endeavor,
         Ex Libris, Fretwell-Downing, Innovative Interfaces, SIRSI, and Serials Solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p>At the workshop, in addition to presentations and discussions concerning the nature and extent of ERM, a proposed entity relationship
         diagram (ERD) and several lists of data elements were presented and discussed. One important outcome of this meeting was the
         formation of a consensus that standards to help guide the development of ERM systems were indeed desirable. This affirmation
         led the workshop steering group to consider a
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         more formal, collaborative approach to the establishment of related best practices and standards. Such an effort, the steering
         group members maintained, might reduce unnecessary costs and duplication at the institutional level, support interoperability
         and data sharing among diverse systems and organizations, and provide extended benefits to the wider library community.
      </p>
      
      <p>Accordingly, the steering group developed and submitted to the DLF a proposal for an ERMI. The aim of this project was to
         formalize and provide further shape and direction for efforts that had previously been very informal and ad hoc. Its primary
         goal was to foster the rapid development of systems and tools for managing e-resources--whether by individual libraries, consortia,
         or vendors--and, more specifically, to
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* describe the functions and architectures needed to enable systems to effectively manage large collections of licensed e-resources;</li>
         
         <li>* establish lists of appropriate supporting data elements and common definitions;</li>
         
         <li>* write and publish experimental XML Schemas/DTDs for local testing;</li>
         
         <li>* identify and promote appropriate best practices; and</li>
         
         <li>* identify and promote appropriate standards to support data interchange.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The DLF accepted the proposal in October 2002. The seven librarians who organized the May 2002 NISO/DLF workshop became the
         steering group for the new initiative. The steering group's task has been to continue the efforts already begun and produce
         the documents, or deliverables, described below.
      </p>
      
      <p>The steering group held weekly conference calls for two years. In addition, to provide for ongoing expert advice, two reactor
         panels, or advisory groups, were formed. One panel (table 3) consisted of librarians deemed specially qualified by their experience
         and interest in ERM systems to provide the kinds of feedback needed.

      <p>Members of the steering group and the librarian reactor panel communicated in a number of ways. First, several members of
         the panel and of the steering group attended a special meeting held in conjunction with the DLF Spring 2003 Forum in New York
         City. Steering group members established a groupware site at UCLA using Microsoft's SharePoint software. This facilitated
         sharing of draft documents, task lists, and information on upcoming meetings and deadlines. The site was also used to post
         questions for the panel members and to provide space for responses and replies. Since not all members of the reactor panel
         were able to use the SharePoint site, questions and responses were also distributed via e-mail. As needed, the steering group
         invited panel members who posted comments and questions to participate in the conference calls. The steering group members
         found that the discussions and feedback substantially enhanced their understanding of the problem, and many comments and questions
         led to refinements of the deliverables.
      </p>
      
      <p>The second panel, the vendor reactor panel, consisted of representatives from a range of other organizations with interests
         in the problems to be addressed by the initiative. This group comprised representatives from a number of integrated ILS providers
         and other companies serving the library market (table 4).

      <p>Communication patterns between the steering group and the vendor panel differed from those used with the librarian panel.
         While the vendor group was provided with versions of the draft documents and the questions being posted to the librarians,
         there was relatively little further communication about those documents at the time. Nevertheless, many of the companies represented
         on the vendor panel have continued to express strong interest in the project. ILS vendors have been especially responsive.
         Many discussions have involved steering group members. For instance, Innovative Interfaces, Inc. (III) has pursued development
         of an ERM module since spring 2002. Tim Jewell has been involved in related discussions and has kept the company informed
         of ongoing work on data elements (see below) so that III's elements could be as consistent with them as possible. Ex Libris
         has also performed substantial analytical work preparatory to product development; Ivy Anderson has contributed heavily to
         those efforts, especially to the statement of functional requirements that has helped guide it. More recently, Dynix held
         predevelopment meetings in which Nathan Robertson was involved, and the company has now developed an internal white paper
         describing the architecture of a future system that references the steering group's work.

         <h3>4.2. PROJECT DELIVERABLES AND USE SCENARIOS</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The ERMI has developed and made available a number of deliverables. An overarching goal has been to control costs and save
         time by providing a series of interrelated documents on which libraries and vendors could base their efforts. It was expected
         that the documents might be put to a variety of other uses as well. The documents and some of their anticipated uses are as
         follows:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Problem Definition and Road Map. The purpose of the road map was to offer an overview of the ERM problem, provide examples
            of the creative approaches some libraries have taken to solving it, and highlight problems needing resolution.
         </li>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <li>* Workflow Diagram. Devising a detailed but generic workflow diagram was expected to help the steering group understand work
            processes and thereby help ensure that other documents would be developed appropriately and completely. A workflow diagram
            could provide a reference point for analyzing local workflows, which could lead to improved internal communication and more
            streamlined processes.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Functional Specifications. This document was intended to clearly and comprehensively identify the functions that an ERM
            system would serve. Libraries could use it to support discussions of the features they might wish to purchase or incorporate
            into a locally developed ERM system or use the specifications in a draft request for proposals from vendors.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Entity Relationship Diagram. An ERD is a standard system-development tool that can help designers conceptualize and present
            groups of data elements, or entities, and their interrelationships. As noted earlier, a draft ERD was presented during the
            DLF/NISO workshop, and a revised version was expected to help clarify discussions during the initiative and to assist future
            system designers.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Data Elements and Definitions. Providing a standardized list of entities and data elements was projected to save developers
            substantial time. Such a list could also be helpful in the development of data standards. Draft lists of data elements were
            discussed at the NISO/DLF workshop, and it was intended that the final, single list would be keyed to, and organized to reflect,
            the ERD. To invoke a naturalistic comparison, the ERD (as a sketch of a whole system), could be likened to a tree, while the
            data elements could be compared to its leaves.
         </li>
         
         <li>* XML Schema. The XML schema was intended to extend the value of a standardized list of entities and elements by providing
            a means for exchanging data. Such a schema could provide partners a platform upon which to test the sharing of license information
            across different systems while giving an additional boost to local library and vendor development efforts.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Final Report. A final report would integrate these documents and present them as a whole.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The importance and potential value of standards to ERM systems is fundamental. A primary motivation for establishing standards
         in this case is to lessen vendor development costs and risks and thereby accelerate the development process. In addition,
         although it is conceivable that ERM systems might be developed and marketed as standalone systems, it seems likely that they
         will need to be overlaid on or otherwise linked to existing tools, such as serials or acquisitions systems, online catalogs,
         and e-resource gateways (Warner 2003). It is therefore critical to establish predictable pathways among variant data streams.
         Libraries that have developed their own systems or that wish to do so in the short term, might hope ultimately to transfer
         their data to a vendor system. If agreement on standards could be reached, those libraries could develop, modify, or align
         their
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         systems with the standards, thus paving the way toward data and system migration. Finally, it is conceivable that, provided
         they had standard ways of doing so, libraries could exchange license information with trading partners or create systems that
         would describe the availability of specific e-resources for specified uses such as interlibrary loan.
      </p>
      
      <p>These considerations led the steering group to survey and monitor the status and development of standards that might dovetail
         with or otherwise have relevance for its work. Farb and Riggio (2004) summarized the results of that investigation as follows:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
         <p>Increasingly, we are learning about new metadata schemata, structures, and
            standards designed to address various communities and constituencies. To
            date, however, none exist that address the dynamic, multidimensional, and
            legal aspects of acquiring and managing licensed e-resources over
            time.
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Table 5 provides a rough mapping of the planned DLF ERMI metadata schema coverage against several others designed to address
         specific aspects of ERM. The first seven column labels indicate general functional areas that need to be addressed by standards,
         and the right-hand column shows whether or not a particular effort is proprietary, which the steering group regarded as an
         important determinant of potential value to libraries and other interested parties. The row labeled "DLF ERMI" indicates the
         steering group's assessment that its work addressed all seven functional areas in a significant way, although attention to
         the "Usage" category was less extensive than for the others. While related standards efforts are shown as having focused on
         fewer areas--such as identification and description--it should not be assumed that the steering group expected its work to
         take the place of other efforts. Instead, the intent was to identify areas of common interest and avoid duplication of effort.

         <h3>4.3. PROJECT RESULTS</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>This section reviews what has been learned in the process of developing the various ERMI documents and the results of the
         XML investigation. The documents themselves may be found in the appendixes.
      </p>
      
      <h4>4.3.1. Functional Requirements (Appendix A)</h4>
      
      <p>In spring 2003, staff from Harvard's and MIT's libraries met with staff from Ex Libris to discuss possible work on an ERM
         tool. While lists of likely data elements were available and discussed, attention quickly turned to the question "But what
         is the functionality?" To answer that question, Harvard and MIT libraries' staff, led by steering group member Ivy Anderson
         and MIT's Ellen Duranceau, collaborated to write a description of the functionality needed in an ERM system. This document
         was subsequently broadened for use as a DLF ERMI deliverable.
      </p>
      
      <p>The functional requirements identify and describe the functions needed to support e-resources throughout their life cycles,
         including selection and acquisition, access provision, resource administration, staff and end-user support, and renewal and
         retention decisions. The requirements are based on the following guiding principles:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Print and e-resource management and access should be through an integrated environment.</li>
         
         <li>* Information provided should be consistent, regardless of the path taken.</li>
         
         <li>* Each data element should have a single point of maintenance.</li>
         
         <li>* ERM systems should be sufficiently flexible to make it possible to easily add  new or additional fields and data elements.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>In addition, a few core requirements for ERM systems were identified. For example,  systems should be able to represent the
         relationships among individual e-resources, packages, licenses, and online interfaces; associate the characteristics of a
         given license, interface, or package with the resources to which it applies; and provide robust reporting and data-export
         capabilities.
      </p>
      
      <p>This document encompasses 47 requirements, more than half of which discuss functionality needed to support staff. The scope
         of the requirements can be seen from the following category summary.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* General (4 requirements). These include the three core requirements in more precise language, and state that "security features
            to control staff views and maintenance rights" are also required.
         </li>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <li>* Resource Discovery (7 requirements). These requirements address the need for making resources available through, or pass
            information about them to, OPACs and Web presentation services and for contextual presentation of license information at the
            point of access.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Bibliographic Management (2 requirements). These address the need for a single point of data entry, maintenance for bibliographic
            information, and the ability to import aggregator holdings and subscription-management data.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Access Management (5 requirements). This group covers the management of basic access-related information such as Uniform
            Resource Identifiers (URIs), User IDs and passwords, and lists of institutional IP addresses, as well as the requirement to
            interoperate with or submit data to related technical systems such as proxy servers and persistent naming services.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Staff Requirements (29 requirements)
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>o General Interface Requirements (4 requirements). The staff interface should be organized into views that are optimized for
                  particular areas of staff activity or interest such as resource acquisition, troubleshooting, license administration, or administration
                  and statistics.
               </li>
               
               <li>o Selection and Evaluation Processes (9 requirements). An ERM system should support the recording of actions and other information
                  at various steps in what may be decentralized processes. It also must have the capability to perform specified actions or
                  to send alerts in defined circumstances. The library should be able to customize actions and triggers to support a site-specific
                  workflow.
               </li>
               
               <li>o Resource Administration and Management (11 requirements). This group describes functionality related to administrative user
                  names and passwords, local configuration options, hardware and software requirements, problem-solving and troubleshooting
                  support, the ability to flag resources as unavailable, and the ability to store information about usage data.
               </li>
               
               <li>o Business Functions (5 requirements). This group covers pricing models, cancellation restrictions, renewal and termination
                  activities, and cost-sharing and consortial-relationship information.
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>To help make the functional requirements as universally applicable as possible, the steering group reviewed and discussed
         them with members of the librarian reactor panel, who were asked to distinguish between the requirements they saw as core
         or essential, and those that were not. The steering group found it gratifying (although vendors may find it dismaying) that
         every requirement was considered core by at least one member of the reactor group. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify
         some of the functions that this group viewed as most critical.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>One of the most important requirements was the ability to manage the relationships among bibliographic entities (i.e., individual
         titles) and the packages, licenses, and interfaces through which they are made available. Another important requirement was
         the ability to store access-related information such as URLs, user IDs and passwords, and institutional IP addresses. The
         ability to record authorized-user categories and other license permissions, restrictions, and metadata about the agreement
         itself was viewed as equally important. Not surprisingly, the ability to store license permissions and associated metadata
         was one of the most frequently cited requirements, and the ability to link to an online version of a redacted license was
         also desired by most panelists. Offering a single point of maintenance for bibliographic and other descriptive data and facilitating
         electronic transfer of holdings and other subscription data from external providers were also identified as essential, as
         was supporting institutional workflows via customized routing and notification tools.
      </p>
      
      <p>Other core or essential features included the ability to store information about administrative IDs and passwords and information
         about and access to usage statistics.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following themes also emerged in the reactor panel discussions:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Most libraries want to be able to use their existing ILSs for core acquisitions functions such as ordering, budgeting, and
            fund accounting. However, these systems must be enhanced to accommodate the additional functionality required by e-resources.
            If ERM is implemented in a stand-alone application, libraries will generally choose to continue to perform core acquisitions
            activities in their ILSs but may want to export some data to the ERM system for analysis and reporting.
         </li>
         
         <li>* The relationship of the descriptive data in an ERM system to other descriptive systems such as the OPAC, federated search
            tools, and link resolution services is a matter of concern for many libraries. All agreed that minimizing duplicative data
            and enabling these systems to "talk to" one another was important. As one reactor said, the OPAC should be recognized as the
            home of MARC bibliographic data.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Usage statistics are an increasing focus of interest for many libraries. In addition to relying on vendor-provided usage
            data, many libraries collect such data locally. The steering group asked the panel members whether an ERM system should store
            usage data or merely point users to external data sources. Although most respondents found pointers to be adequate, a number
            felt that a common framework for storing and presenting statistics from disparate sources should be provided.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Many large libraries use persistent URIs. Support for them can be critical to the library's operation. In general, libraries
            that assign persistent URIs want to be able to record them in the ERM system. Many agreed that being able to generate persistent
            URIs was both desirable and feasible since the algorithms by which they are assigned tend to be highly formulaic.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <h4>4.3.2. Workflow Diagram (Appendix B)</h4>
      
      <p>The purpose of the workflow diagram was to provide a detailed overview of the activities associated with managing the life
         cycle of electronic products (e-products). A starting point was the realization that while there are some similarities between
         the acquisition and management processes for traditional, physical library materials and those for e-products, many issues
         are unique to e-products.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some of these differences are obvious from the overview flowcharts in Appendix B. For example, e-products routinely require
         a licensing process and may pose technological challenges for implementation. Activities associated with acquiring and activating
         a networked product are substantially different from those associated with the receipt and processing procedures for physical
         items. Maintenance, troubleshooting, and license renewal for e-products are quite unlike the circulation, physical storage,
         and repair issues for physical objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>The flowchart for the project, developed primarily by Kimberly Parker and Nathan Robertson, reflects these complex realities
         by breaking down a model workflow into the four main subprocesses identified for HERMES in section 3.1. Each subprocess is
         depicted through its own diagram. The first subprocess, Product Consideration and Trial Processes, traces typical steps from
         the point at which library staff become aware of the availability of an e-resource of interest, through trial and evaluation
         steps, to the "Proceed/Don't proceed" decision point. A decision to proceed would trigger three other processes shown in the
         diagram (since they typically occur concurrently)--License Negotiation, Technical Evaluation, and Business Negotiation.
      </p>
      
      <p>Once all these processes reach the "approval to proceed" point, the third major set of processes is triggered. These are labeled
         Implementation Processes and encompass such disparate steps as product registration and configuration, cataloging and inclusion
         in appropriate Web pages, and activities related to availability and handling of usage data. The final set of processes is
         Product Maintenance and Review. Among the functions included in the routine maintenance category are the capture of usage
         statistics, troubleshooting and problem resolution, routine product changes from the vendor (e.g., URL revisions), and revisions
         to public documentation.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">

      <h4>4.3.3. Data Entities, Elements, and Structure (Appendixes C, D, and E)</h4>
      
      <p>Three of the deliverables are tied especially closely to one another: the ERD, the data element dictionary, and the data structure.
         The ERD is a visual representation of
         ERM concepts and the relationships between them. The data element dictionary identifies and defines the individual data elements
         that an ERM system must contain and manage, but leaves the relationship between the elements to be inferred by the reader.
         The data structure associates each data element with the entities and relationships defined in the ERD. Together, the three
         documents form a complete conceptual data model for ERM.
      </p>
      
      <p>An ERD is often used as a way to visualize a relational database. Each entity represents a database table, and relationship
         lines represent the keys in one table that point to specific records in related tables. ERDs may also be more abstract, not
         necessarily capturing every table needed within a database but simply diagramming the major concepts and relationships. The
         ERD developed for the ERMI is of the latter type. It is intended to present an abstract, theoretical view of the major entities
         and relationships needed for management of e-resources, but does not identify every table that would be necessary for an ERM
         database.
      </p>
      
      <p>The data element dictionary, which now includes roughly 300 elements, grew out of a data dictionary developed for UCLA's ERDb.
         It lists the elements alphabetically by data element name and includes an identifier, definition, and, where deemed necessary,
         comments. To the extent possible, element naming and definitions were based on guidelines provided by International Standards
         Office (ISO) 11179. In addition, an effort was made to identify and use element names already included in other relevant metadata
         schemas such as Dublin Core, ONIX, ONIX for Serials, and METS. A more detailed  discussion of these standards and schemas
         and of how the work of the initiative relates to them is provided in Appendix F.
      </p>
      
      <p>The data structure document integrates the ERD and the data element dictionary by mapping the data elements from the dictionary
         to the approximately two dozen entities depicted in the ERD. In addition to the names and definitions, the data structure
         indicates element type (e.g., logical, pointer, text), use or functionality (including references to specific points in the
         functional requirements document), suggested values, optionality (whether optional or mandatory), repeatability (whether the
         element carries a unique value or can be repeated), and selected notes or examples for additional clarity.
      </p>
      
      <p>Some of the two dozen defined entities, such as the entities for Electronic Resource and for Interface, could be characterized
         as serving a primarily descriptive function. A large number of data elements are required to summarize license terms. For
         example, a Terms Defined entity includes groups for identification, user group, and terms of use--which itself contains some
         30 elements covering such license provisions as fair use, scholarly sharing, interlibrary loan, and course packs.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>There are also entities for Acquisition and Processing Workflow, and for Access Information and Administrative Information.
         Some entities can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, the Organization entity can be used to record information
         about any business, vendor, provider, publisher, licensor, etc., with which a library does business related to e-products.
      </p>
      
      <p>Since the elements identified, named, and defined for this part of the project were seen as possibly forming the core for
         an emerging data exchange standard, the lists have been available via the Web hub for some time. Communication with two ILS
         vendors (Innovative Interfaces and Ex Libris) that have been actively working on ERM systems has been especially close, and
         both have undertaken substantial work to see that their data elements are consistent with those of the initiative.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>4.3.4. XML Investigation (Appendix F)</h4>
      
      <p>The final proposed deliverable was an XML schema that would foster the development of metadata standards for the exchange
         of information about e-resources, e-resource packages, and licenses. During fall 2003, a group was formed to pursue this work.
         Coordinated by Adam Chandler, it included fellow steering group members Sharon Farb, Angela Riggio, and Nathan Robertson,
         plus Robin Wendler (Harvard), Nancy Hoebelheinrich (Stanford), and Simon St. Laurent (O'Reilly &amp; Associates). Rick Silterra
         (Cornell) joined the effort later. Because this part of the project depended on finalizing work on the data entities, elements,
         and structure, it was impractical to get very far ahead of that part of the project. The desire to complete the project in
         a timely way and make it available for comment and use also meant that time available for this part of the project was fairly
         limited. The data element work was informed and affected by what the steering group knew of emerging work elsewhere on standards,
         including the work of the NISO/EDItEUR Joint Working Party for the Exchange of Serials Subscription Information.
      </p>
      
      <p>The XML investigation began with a consideration of the uses to which an ERM schema might be put. These possible uses included</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* exchange among vendors and libraries of data for use in link resolvers, including user group license terms;</li>
         
         <li>* publisher e-resource title lists;</li>
         
         <li>* packaging actionable license terms with associated objects in a preservation archive (e.g., using METS);</li>
         
         <li>* dissemination of license and administrative data to members of a consortium; and</li>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <li>* exchange of license data with a contracting partner.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>With these many possibilities in mind, XML group member Wendler developed a draft schema for general use that included Dublin
         Core and MODS name space and schemas, and a slot or placeholder for rights expression. As the group discussed the draft and
         as the NISO/EDItEUR and XrML/ODRL dynamics further unfolded, it became clear that a more fruitful approach would be to concentrate
         on a limited number of practical scenarios. Since license terms have been of substantial concern to libraries for several
         years, but no directly related, known XML work had yet taken place within that community, it was decided to focus on license
         terms. The group focused on two sets of elements:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* a short <i>quick-fix</i> set that would best describe license terms that staff and users would most need to know; and
         </li>
         
         <li>* a broader <i>license</i> set of elements that could be most usefully shared by two libraries or other entities such as a publisher or consortium and
            a library.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>Members of the group selected the required elements from the DLF ERM system data structure document and created instance documents
         with data that were then used to develop a schema optimized to these narrow uses.
      </p>
      
      <p>Because of the many potential advantages of relying on existing schemas, the group looked for work that was closely related
         or that might be adapted to the purposes it had in mind. Apparent similarities led to investigation of work on digital rights
         management (DRM), and rights expression languages (RELs). As Karen Coyle has described in her recent report for the Library
         of Congress (Coyle 2004), two well-established RELs currently vie for recognition as the standard for media products such
         as movies in DVD format. The first of these, now referred to as MPEG-21/5, grew out of the XrML language developed by a company
         named ContentGuard. The second is called the Open Digital Rights Language, or ODRL. These initiatives are intended not only
         to enable a rights holder to describe what a user may do with a particular resource but also to confer substantial control
         of user behavior on the implementing party. The XML group learned of the existence of extensive patent claims related to MPEG-21/5,
         and its strong preference for open standards led it to focus on ODRL.
      </p>
      
      <p>A third initiative that sparked interest is from Creative Commons and is based on the resource description framework (RDF).
         The intent of the Creative Commons approach, unlike that of the MPEG-21/5 and ODRL, is to provide a means for authors to declare
         the terms on which they are making works available free of charge via the Internet, rather than to exert control. The group
         elected to focus some of its attention on the Creative Commons schema, and four schemas (corresponding to the two use cases
         described above) were developed: one for ODRL, another based on the Creative Commons RDF, and two for native ERMI, which were
         based on ERMI project elements and values.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The attempt to use ODRL met with mixed results. While ODRL proved to be extensible and flexible, learning to use it effectively
         was time-consuming and would have taken much longer without the generous assistance of Renato Iannella and Susanne Guth of
         the ODRL initiative. For example, the group found that only the form of the XML documents could be validated in the ODRL schema
         that the group developed, meaning that any value (including invalid ones) would be accepted. (Iannella told us subsequently
         that it is possible to validate a document more completely, but time did not allow us to alter our demonstration ODRL schema
         to incorporate that feature.) In addition, it is necessary to describe all permitted uses under ODRL; this is clearly inconsistent
         with libraries' expectations that they should be able to make reasonable uses of resources that are not prohibited by licenses.
      </p>
      
      <p>A greater degree of success was hoped for with the Creative Commons RDF, because it was not designed to support direct control
         of use and its ethos is consistent with open access and fair use. While less constraining and more extensible than the ODRL,
         it unfortunately also lacks provision for validating structure and data types. The group consequently concluded that the Creative
         Commons RDF could not provide a basis for license description and communication.
      </p>
      
      <p>These discoveries led to work on the third alternative, the aforementioned native ERMI license-expression development. In
         essence, this would entail establishing a name space for license expression on the basis of elements and values from the ERMI
         data dictionary and data structure documents. Its benefits include the ability to simply use any of those elements and values,
         to avoid time required to adapt other existing RELs to purposes for which they may be ill suited, and to have greater syntax
         and value validation. One added benefit that was found in the process of creating the two test native ERMI schemas is that
         they were more compact than those created using either ODRL or the Creative Commons RDF. Because of this "best fit," the group
         believes that discussion of standardized license expression within the library and scholarly publishing communities should
         focus on the native ERMI alternative in the near term.

         <h2>5. Response to the Initiative and Future Considerations</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>Now that the results of the DLF ERMI have been fully described, it is time to briefly consider responses to the work from
         the library and vendor communities and to review selected areas where members of the steering group feel that additional work
         is most needed.

      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>5.1. LIBRARIAN AND VENDOR RESPONSE</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The main reason behind the development of the ERMI was the realization that few libraries had the tools needed for successful
         management of e-resources and that developing such systems would be time-consuming and complex. From the beginning, the members
         of the ERMI steering group felt that solving such a problem would require extensive collaboration and investment. It is consequently
         very satisfying to report that librarians and vendors have had very positive reactions to the initiative.

         Most important, at this writing, several vendors either have already begun developing ERM systems or services or have announced
         plans to do so, and most of this work has drawn heavily from the project's draft functional requirements and data elements.
         These organizations and their ERM-related products and services include the following:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>o The Colorado Alliance plans to improve and enhance the Gold Rush product in 2004.</li>
         
         <li>o Dynix announced development of an electronic management module during the 2004 ALA annual conference.</li>
         
         <li>o EBSCO has developed an electronic journal service that incorporates significant ERM functionality and uses an e-resource
            life cycle diagram in its literature.
         </li>
         
         <li>o Endeavor has announced plans to develop a full-function ERM product named Meridian for release in 2005.</li>
         
         <li>o Ex Libris has announced development of a product named Verde that will draw upon the SFX knowledge base. Initial release
            is planned by the end of 2004.
         </li>
         
         <li>o Harrassowitz has announced plans for HERMES 2.0, a service that will incorporate ERM features.</li>
         
         <li>o Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has developed an ERM module that is moving from development and beta testing into production.</li>
         
         <li>o Serials Solutions has an ERM product in its near-term plans.</li>
         
         <li>o SIRSI has developed a prototype system that was shown at the 2004 ALA annual conference.</li>
         
         <li>o VTLS announced plans this spring to develop an ERM product called Verify (VTLS 2004).</li>

         <h3>5.2. OUTSTANDING ISSUES</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>As these vendors develop their products and services, they and the libraries they serve inevitably will find places where
         the ERMI products will seem lacking or incomplete. Accordingly, they will devise new and helpful approaches to solving some
         of the problems sketched out in this report or to problems not yet identified. In that spirit, we would like to identify some
         problems that we were unable to solve within our time constraints, but that merit further work.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">

      <h4>5.2.1. Consortium Support and Functionality</h4>
      
      <p>The ERMI has focused on the needs of individual libraries rather than on those of the library consortia to which so many libraries
         now belong. That has allowed rapid headway to be made, but a broader view that takes consortial support functions into account
         is highly desirable. Doing so is complicated by the fact that library consortia differ substantially from one another. Some,
         such as Ohiolink and CDL have significant amounts of central funding and a broad service mandate, while others function more
         as buying clubs and have correspondingly more limited missions, staffing, and goals. Nevertheless, some steps in this direction
         have been taken within the last several months. The extent of consortial support desired at the "central funding/broad mandate"
         end of this continuum was suggested in an assessment conducted for CDL (Wright 2003), which referenced the work of the ERMI.
         In March 2004, the University of California (UC) system libraries' System-Wide Operations and Planning Advisory Group (SOPAG)
         followed up on this assessment with a retreat to discuss ERM needs. Each library in the UC system sent representatives to
         this meeting. Although the functionality and architecture described in the ERMI documents was discussed and endorsed, attention
         was also given to SOPAG requirements seen needing a higher profile or not addressed in the DLF initiative. For example, CDL
         expends significant effort tracking which member libraries participate in which voluntary buy-in purchases and what cost shares
         apply. Additionally, evaluation and negotiation of e-journal packages requires the ability to track current print and e-journal
         subscription information at both the individual campus and consortial levels and to link to it other information such as cost,
         usage and Thompson ISI (Institute for Scientific Information) "impact factor." Given the likelihood that CDL libraries will
         continue to use different ILSs and ERM systems, the need for data standards and interoperability noted above is especially
         acute.
      </p>
      
      <p>Following the SOPAG ERM retreat, two relevant sessions were held at the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC)
         meeting. The first session focused on consortial <i>administrivia</i> and offered an opportunity for consortium managers to discuss the kinds of information they must track and communicate to
         vendors and member libraries and related support tools they have devised. Librarians who have followed the ERM discussions
         would have recognized many themes, including the diversity of data needed (such as library and vendor contacts IP ranges,
         and renewal dates, and reliance on various spreadsheets and databases to do that work). The second session was on managing
         e-resources across the consortium. It featured descriptions of the work of the DLF, the UC system, and the Gold Rush product.
         Attendees expressed substantial interest in vendor developments, their support of consortia, and data standards. A subsequent
         ERMI steering group discussion of points raised during these ICOLC sessions concluded that the ERMI data model supports, or
         can be extended to address, key consortial requirements, but that a more careful review was needed. Since CDL is engaged in
         analyzing its requirements, it is conceivable that a document resulting from that process could be developed into a more generic
         statement of consortial ERM requirements and released under ICOLC auspices.

      <h4>5.2.2. Usage Data</h4>
      
      <p>Although there is some provision for usage data within the ERMI data model, it would be desirable to better describe both
         the analyses libraries will perform on the data available to them and how such data might be passed more easily to libraries
         for incorporation into their ERM systems. Important sources for analyses of functionality are model usage-data programs such
         as the Data Farm developed at the University of Pennsylvania (Zucca 2003; University of Pennsylvania Libraries 2004) and ARL's
         E-metrics initiative (Association of Research Libraries 2004). Project COUNTER's code of practice for the "recording and exchange
         of online usage data" will undoubtedly become an increasingly important standard in this area, and the recently announced
         availability of an XML DTD for COUNTER usage reports is particularly welcome, as it will pave the way for smoother and more
         effortless transport of usage data.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>5.2.3. Resource Succession</h4>
      
      <p>One issue related to the ERMI data model is that individual journals frequently pass from one publisher to another, or from
         platform to platform. As this happens, it may be difficult to keep track of the particular license terms, archival rights,
         and access information related to each change.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>5.2.4. Data Standards</h4>
      
      <p>As important as these efforts are, they seem unlikely to succeed in the long run unless work to develop and maintain relevant
         data standards continues along with them.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Serials Description and Holdings. Knowing that the NISO/EDItEUR Joint Working Party for the Exchange of Serials Subscription
            Information was working to develop a standard exchange format for serials subscription data, the ERMI steering group decided
            to rely on that group's work rather than to develop a competing standard. The steering group regards the work of the joint
            working party as fundamentally important and looks forward to further developments.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Standard Identifiers. The steering group concluded that a single global e-resource identification system or registry for
            packages, providers, and interfaces could make it possible to exchange certain kinds of information far more reliably and
            precisely than at present.
         </li>
         
         <li>* License Term Expression. Resolving issues related to standardized communication about intellectual property, licensing,
            and permitted use will also require additional work. Luckily, there is evidence of interest in this problem. For example,
            discussions at the recent CONSER Summit on Serials in the Electronic Environment suggested that some publishers may be ready
            to experiment with providing public versions of their licenses to libraries, and there was interest in establishing a test-bed
            of licenses marked up in XML for
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
            
            importing into local ERM systems. There have also been discussions of the possibility of establishing a standard data dictionary
            for publisher licensing and rights expression, using the ERMI data dictionary as a starting point.
         </li>
         
         <li>* Interoperability. It seems reasonable to question whether or not stand-alone ERM applications can be developed that are
            truly capable of integration into ILSs from other vendors. While the steering group believes that standardizing data elements
            is an important step in this direction, it is possible that a new initiative called VIEWS, which is aimed at "enabling web
            services between disparate applications used in libraries," may be another (Dynix 2004).
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>Resolving these issues will require organized, cooperative efforts from libraries, consortia, publishers, serial agents and
         support companies, and library system vendors, as well as effective structures for communicating about them.
      </p>

         <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      </center>
      
      <p>The new electronic environment in which libraries, publishers, and vendors operate has evolved quickly and become quite complex
         in relatively short order, but the complexities we now recognize could pale in comparison to those that may be just around
         the corner--as investments in e-resources grow, technical innovation continues, and business models evolve. No matter how
         the environment evolves, new tools, standards, smart choices, and collaboration will be needed. We hope that the DLF ERMI
         has enabled all these activities to happen more quickly and to be more efficient and effective.

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The goal envisioned in these requirements is a system that supports management of the information and workflows necessary
         to efficiently select, evaluate, acquire, maintain, and provide access to e-resources in accordance with their business and
         license terms. Such a system should support the service requirements of e-resources while building on existing investments
         in library technology, through seamless interaction and efficient sharing of data with traditional MARC-based online catalogs,
         Web portals, federated searching tools, local resolution services, local authentication and access-management systems, and
         traditional library-management functions. Whether implemented as a stand-alone system or as part of an existing library-management
         system, the ERM functions should complement, rather than duplicate, the capabilities of other systems deployed by the library.
      </p>
      
      <p>This document outlines the broad areas of functionality that are required in such an ERM system. It is not intended, at this
         stage of development, to be a detailed description of every function needed, but rather to provide an overview of the main
         functions required of the system. The examples under each functional area are representative and illustrative, rather than
         exhaustive.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The ERM system should offer an integrated environment that supports both management and access, without maintaining duplicate
         systems. The system should offer a capacity for global updating and flexible addition of fields. It should offer the ability
         to hide fields and records from public view and have a single point of maintenance for each data element. It should support
         interoperation and dynamic data sharing with existing OPACs, Web portals, library-management systems, and link resolution
         services. It should offer users consistent information, regardless of the path they take in seeking it. Finally, the ERMS
         should, over time, support the ability to store, access, search, and generate reports of the information that it contains.
      </p>
      
      <h4>FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h4>
      
      <h4>General Requirements</h4>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The ability to support complex, multiple-to-multiple relationships that accurately map how resources, business terms, licenses,
         and other components interrelate is an essential building block for supporting the functionality described throughout this
         document.
      </p>
      
      <p>The companion Entity Relationship Diagram for Electronic Resource Management (see Appendix C) presents a schematic representation
         of these relationships.
      </p>
      
      <p>For all areas of functionality described in this document, it must be possible to</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>1. Identify what bibliographic entities (electronic and print) are covered by or provided through a given license, set of
            business terms, package, or online interface platform (hereinafter "interface");
         </li>
         
         <li>2. Associate the characteristics of a given license, set of business terms, package, or interface with all the bibliographic
            entities (electronic and print) to which they apply;
         </li>
         
         <li>3. Offer security features to control staff views and maintenance rights
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>3.1. hide confidential information from certain staff</li>
               
               <li>3.2. restrict the ability to add, update, or delete certain data (field by field) to designated staff</li>
               
               <li>3.3. provide the ability to construct simplified data views by hiding unused fields; and</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         <li>4. Perform ad hoc queries and generate reports across a broad range of fields and table values.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <h4>Resource-Discovery Requirements</h4>
      
      <p>While adequate facilities for searching and browsing for e-resources already exist in OPACs and portals at many libraries
         (through searches of author, title, alternate titles, cross-references, subjects, keywords, and other descriptors), facilities
         to cull e-resources for resource-discovery purposes are lacking at other institutions.  Ideally, the ERM system should provide
         a user interface for libraries that require one as well as a means of integrating appropriate license data into the results
         of searches within externally deployed systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>The ideal system should also provide Web developers database table- or view-level access and the ability to bypass the native
         interface to query and present data to the user in any number of custom-configurable ways. An ERMS implementation should include
         a dedicated user interface that is able to capture appropriate data in other systems or to share its information with elements
         in other supported systems to create unified user displays, including the capabilities described below.
      </p>
      
      <p>It should be possible to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>5. Make resources available through or pass on information about resources to OPACs and Web-presentation services using traditional
            resource discovery methods, including the ability to search and browse by author, title, alternate titles, cross-references,
            subject, and keywords, facilitate the generation of dynamic, database-driven
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
            
            Web pages that constitute pathfinders, course- or discipline-specific pages, or lists of selected e-resources in a given subject
            area and of a given type (e.g., e-journals, article databases) while supporting fully customizable presentation templates
            that are not limited to the branding and look and feel of the native interface;
         </li>
         
         <li>6. Offer contextual presentation of relevant license information to the user at the point of access, regardless of the access
            path taken through any supported tool,
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>6.1. make apparent to users whether or not they are authorized for access under the license</li>
               
               <li>6.2. display relevant permitted uses, use restrictions, and special requirements such as:
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>6.2.1. permission to use in course packs, course Web sites, and distance education</li>
                     
                     <li>6.2.2. unusual prohibitions, such as record download limits and time of day restrictions</li>
                     
                     <li>6.2.3. citation requirements;</li>
                     
                  </ul>
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         <li>7. Support site-defined and auxiliary descriptive data. Such data might include:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>7.1. locally defined fields for descriptive needs not covered in existing MARC records</li>
               
               <li>7.2. a free-form note</li>
               
               <li>7.3. locally defined lists and descriptors;</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         <li>8. Make available information about and provide access to other versions of the resource being viewed, including links to
            catalog holdings information for physical manifestations and direct links to all accessible electronic versions;
         </li>
         
         <li>9. Make available information about issues particular to the online interface, such as inaccessible or nonsubscribed portions
            not marked as such at the site, unusual log-on and log-off requirements, and navigation or accessibility features;
         </li>
         
         <li>10. Flag resources as unavailable in real time, with an optional explanatory note (see also Administrative and Management
            Functions); and
         </li>
         
         <li>11. Offer advisory notices of planned downtime and other time-sensitive information.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <h4>Bibliographic Management Requirements</h4>
      
      <p>In many libraries, both traditional and auxiliary bibliographic data may be distributed among a variety of systems, including
         the library-management system, a federated searching portal, and a link resolution service. Nevertheless, to the extent possible,
         each unique data element should have to be maintained only once. Updates in one system should be automatically reflected in
         corresponding systems, either through the dynamic sharing of data or, where redundant storage cannot be eliminated, by propagation
         to other systems. Loading of data from external systems should also be supported.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Specifically, it should be possible to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>12. Provide a single point of maintenance for bibliographic and auxiliary descriptive data that can be exchanged or shared
            between the OPAC, portal lists, federated search tools, local resolution services, and other bibliographic systems and services;
            and
         </li>
         
         <li>13. Import subscription-management data from external providers using standard software and developing protocols,
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>13.1. lists of titles, ISSNs, and uniform resource identifiers (URIs) delivered in Excel or delimited format</li>
               
               <li>13.2. changes to titles and dates of coverage in aggregated databases communicated via any XML-based or standards-based data
                  transfer protocol, such as ONIX for serials
               </li>
               
               <li>13.3. holdings updates supplied by a publisher or subscription agent to facilitate electronic check-in.</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <h4>Access-Management Requirements</h4>
      
      <p>All libraries rely on authentication and access-management systems that are external to the systems and tools described in
         this document. These external systems may be as straightforward as reliance on the remote-authorization mechanism of an online
         provider (via IP addresses or user names and passwords) or as complex as a locally developed access-management service that
         assigns persistent identifiers to resources, passes connection requests to a system that validates users according to a local
         authentication scheme (e.g., Kerberos), and routes valid users through a proxy server. Institutions with complex local environments
         can be expected to have customized systems and tools with which to perform these functions, and the ERM system must interoperate
         with them.
      </p>
      
      <p>The ERMS should accommodate both simple and complex environments with a disparate range of needs. To accomplish this, the
         following generalized requirements are necessary:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Management of basic access-related information, such as URIs, user IDs and passwords, and lists of institutional IP addresses;</li>
         
         <li>* Support for the creation of persistent URIs and for additional data elements required to support complex local access management
            services, such as proxy servers; and
         </li>
         
         <li>* A set of export functions by which an ERMS can communicate its information to a local system or service.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>Specifically, it should be possible to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>14. Store and maintain access URIs and make these actionable for end users, according to local requirements:
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
            
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>14.1. store vendor-supplied primary and secondary URIs (e.g., for mirror sites) used for access to the resource</li>
               
               <li>14.2. support the creation, storage, and updating of persistent URIs and/or integration with external systems for managing
                  persistent identifiers
               </li>
               
               <li>14.3. support authentication and access systems (such as proxy servers or statistics- generating scripts), allowing for URIs
                  to be constructed on the fly on the basis of stored data elements
               </li>
               
               <li>14.4. generate notifications and/or exports of URI information to appropriate linked or external systems according to local
                  requirements (e.g., notification or export to cataloging and information technology departments or systems)
               </li>
               
               <li>14.5. provide seamless functional integration with external systems that record this information (e.g., through a shared pointer);</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>

      <h4>STAFF REQUIREMENTS</h4>
      
      <h4>Staff Interface</h4>
      
      <p>An ERM system requires a staff interface that enables library staff to efficiently carry out the work described in the sections
         that follow. The interface should be organized into views that are optimized for particular areas of staff activity or interest,
         such as resource acquisition, troubleshooting, license administration, or administration and statistics. Details of appropriate
         interface design are not addressed in these requirements; these are left to the art and discretion of system developers.
      </p>
      
      <p>Through this interface, staff should be able to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>19. Search, browse, and retrieve records by attributes unique to e-resources, such as license, vendor, interface, record status,
            licensed site, consortium, and library selector or other local contact individual;
         </li>
         
         <li>20. View the full range of information appropriate to the staff member's security profile and functional role;</li>
         
         <li>21. To the extent possible, link to other relevant information stored in library management systems, portals, or related systems;
            and
         </li>
         
         <li>22. View records that are hidden from the public.</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <h4>Selection and Evaluation Process</h4>
      
      <p>During the selection and evaluation process, it is typically necessary for a decentralized group of individuals to coordinate
         a complex and iterative series of steps. The ERM system should provide support for recording actions at each of these steps
         and be capable of performing specified actions upon completion of a given task and of sending alerts when anticipated actions
         do not occur.
      </p>
      
      <p>A typical selection and evaluation process might involve the following steps and require the following reminders and notifications,
         all built from stored action dates and locally definable status fields:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>* Build request record for trial;</li>
         
         <li>* Flag resource as trial;</li>
         
         <li>* Notify interested parties that trial is live and provide the access instructions and expiration date (triggered by trial
            start date and e-mail address[es] input into request record);
         </li>
         
         <li>* Allow staff (and, optionally, users) to access the trial via stored URL;</li>
         
         <li>* Send reminder to those notified of a trial that expiration date is near (triggered by trial end date and e-mail address[es]
            input into request record);
         </li>
         
         <li>* Record opinions of key players and final purchase decision, allowing for both central and local input of opinions and funding
            commitments into notes fields in request record;
         </li>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <li>* Prompt licensing/acquisitions contact to report purchase decision (triggered by decision date input into request record).
            The most common options are "Approve," "Reject," or "Put on Hold"; and
         </li>
         
         <li>* For resources that are approved for purchase, additional statuses and actions would be required, including</li>
         
         <li>* notify licensing contact to obtain and negotiate license, and remind this contact if license is not completed by a given
            deadline (triggered by stored licensing contact, notification of approved status, and deadline input at time of approval)
         </li>
         
         <li>* notify access contact if status has not changed to "live" by deadline (triggered by inputting likely access date into system
            at time of approval)
         </li>
         
         <li>* notify cataloging and selector/product sponsor, as well as other interested parties, when access is available (triggered,
            for example, by changing status to "Live" and by stored e-mail address[es] related to this purchase).
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The companion Electronic Resource Management Workflow Flowchart provides a detailed diagrammatic view of workflow decision
         and action points (see Appendix B).
      </p>
      
      <p>To support these processes, it should be possible to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>23. Create provisional records for resources that may or may not be permanently acquired and track the selection and evaluation
            process through acquisition or rejection;
         </li>
         
         <li>24. Assign locally definable status fields to request records and associate particular actions with those statuses. Examples
            of such fields include "New Request," "On Trial," "Trial Expired/Decision Pending," "Approved," "Rejected," and "On Hold";
         </li>
         
         <li>25. Assign locally definable fields to request records for license routing and status and associate particular actions with
            those fields. Site should be able, for example, to define a list of individuals from whom sign-off is required, send reminders
            to license reviewers, and record approval or rejection status, with notes;
         </li>
         
         <li>26. Assign multiple local contact individuals and site-defined roles to both request records and permanent resource records;</li>
         
         <li>27. Send e-mail notifications to individuals designated as local or licensing contacts;</li>
         
         <li>28. .Make trial resources available in a secure manner through the library's resource tool of choice to authorized users (if
            wanted) and staff
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>28.1. store trial URIs and passwords and make these available, securely if necessary</li>
               
               <li>28.2. flag items unambiguously as trial resources, with associated public and staff notes</li>
               
               <li>28.3. record a trial expiration date and, optionally, send an alert to designated recipients n days prior to trial expiration;</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <li>29. Record a decision due date and, optionally, send an alert to designated recipients n days prior to decision date;</li>
         
         <li>30. Establish a site-defined routing workflow for resources that are approved for purchase. For example, it should be possible
            to send notifications to designated staff or departments or to place resources in a queue for further action by those units
            to trigger actions such as the placing of an order, completion of cataloging, and implementation of access management by designated
            staff; and
         </li>
         
         <li>31. Purge rejected records from the system, sequester into a history archive, or retain such records with notes about the
            decision process (including a link to written evaluations if wanted), at the library's discretion.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <h4>Resource Administration and Management Functions</h4>
      
      <p>The functions described in this section pertain to activities required to fulfill license obligations and to administer and
         support resources that have been acquired. Some of the data and functions pertain to the license itself, while others pertain
         to the management of individual resources. The system should be able to record data at the most efficient level required to
         avoid redundancy, relying on the relationships among entities to make the information available at other applicable levels
         (e.g., individual resource, package, or interface).
      </p>
      
      <p>It should be possible to:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>32. Store license rights and terms for reference, reporting, and control of services

                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>32.1.1. identify whether a given title may be used for the service and under what conditions</li>
                     
                     <li>32.1.2. generate reports of all materials that may or may not be used for the service with notes about under what conditions,
                        and
                     </li>

               <li>32.2. include a mechanism for adding new services, allowing staff to specify the name of the service and associated actions
                  such as public displays, reports, and alerts;
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         <li>33. Record the categories of users and sites that are authorized for access to a given resource and generate displays for
            end users and staff on the basis of this information (see also Access Management Requirements);
         </li>
         
         <li>34. Support breach investigation and cure activities and other activities that may be required to fulfill license obligations
            
            
            <hr width="75%">
            <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
            
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>34.1. record the cure period for breach and generate alerts at library-specified intervals on the basis of  this information
                  when a breach has been reported
               </li>
               
               <li>34.2. provide a breach-incident log in which to record reports of alleged breaching activity, including date and source of
                  initial report, open/closed status, resolution date, and actions taken. This should have the capability of generating reports
                  on commonalities of breaches (e.g., type of breach, department showing regular breaches)
               </li>
               
               <li>34.3. include a mechanism for adding fields in which to record unusual compliance requirements that the library may want to
                  track, including implementation status and date and the ability to generate reports or alerts on the basis of this information.
                  Examples might include a requirement to post notices to end users or to destroy locally held copies upon termination (see
                  also Termination Activities);
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
         <li>35. Record additional license terms and metadata for contract management and auditing purposes, such as license commencement
            date, duration of agreement, confidentiality provisions, and other site-definable key terms;
         </li>
         
         <li>36. Provide the ability to display or link to an online version of a license agreement;</li>

                  manner of execution, and the applicable license through which rights are provided. It should be possible to associate multiple
                  archival field clusters with a given resource to track successive rights with multiple providers
               </li>
               
               <li>37.2. retain archival versions of license terms and conditions if desired, so that preexisting terms of agreement can be mapped
                  to the bibliographic entities and dates for which such terms applied;
               </li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>

      <h4>Business Functions</h4>
      
      <p>Many of the business activities described here are related to, and may already be accomplished through, functionality that
         exists in a traditional library learning management system. Although item 44 in this section affirms the general requirement
         to support traditional acquisitions-related functions, such as ordering, fund accounting, and the ability to commit and expend
         budgets and to generate budget reports, it does not attempt to describe these requirements in detail, on the assumption that
         full acquisitions functionality will continue to reside within a library management system. These

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The Electronic Resource Management Workflow Flowchart provides a detailed overview of the activities associated with managing
         the life cycle of electronic products, and is intended to be generally applicable to the processes followed at most institutions.
          The flowchart highlights functions and processes that are necessary for the acquisition and ongoing management of electronic
         products.  While there are some similarities between the acquisition and management processes for traditional physical library
         materials and those for electronic products, there are many issues and complexities unique to electronic products.  The following
         overview diagrams of physical resource and e-resource workflows highlight the similarities and differences between the two
         processes:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appb01.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>As the diagrams illustrate, there are substantial differences between physical and electronic product management.  Electronic
         products routinely require a licensing process, and may pose technological challenges for implementation.  Acquiring and activating
         an electronic product differs substantially from
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         the receipt and physical processing procedures for physical items, and ongoing maintenance, troubleshooting, and license renewal
         for electronic products are quite unlike the circulation, physical storage, and repair issues for physical objects.
      </p>
      
      <p>Throughout the flowchart a number of processes are depicted in detail while others are not.  The processes with detailed workflow
         representations are those where most institutions proceed in a similar fashion and where the processes for electronic products
         diverge fairly significantly from physical formats.  Processes without great detail in the workflow are either those where
         different institutions have differing processes or those where traditional workflows (with perhaps minor variations) are employed
         in processing the electronic products.

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>This document is an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for a system to manage e-resources.  An ERD is a model that identifies
         the concepts or entities that exist in a system and the relationships between those entities.  An ERD is often used as a way
         to visualize a relational database: each entity represents a database table, and the relationship lines represent the keys
         in one table that point to specific records in related tables.  ERDs may also be more abstract, not necessarily capturing
         every table needed within a database, but serving to diagram the major concepts and relationships.  This ERD is of the latter
         type, intended to present an abstract, theoretical view of the major entities and relationships needed for management of e-resources.
          It may assist the database design process for an ERM system, but does not identify every table that would be necessary for
         an e-resource management database.
      </p>
      
      <p>This ERD should be examined in close consultation with other components of the <i>Report of the DLF Electronic Resource Management Initiative</i>, especially Appendix D (Data Element Dictionary) and Appendix E (Data Structure).  The ERD presents a visual representation
         of e-resource management concepts and the relationships between them.  The Data Element Dictionary identifies and defines
         the individual data elements that an e-resource management system must contain and manage, but leaves the relationship between
         the elements to be inferred by the reader.  The Data Structure associates each data element with the entities and relationships
         defined in the ERD.  Together, these three documents form a complete conceptual data model for e-resource management.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <center>
         <h3>Understanding the Model</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>There are several different modeling systems for entity relationship diagramming.  This ERD is presented in the "Information
         Engineering" style.  Those unfamiliar with entity relationship diagramming or unfamiliar with this style of notation may wish
         to consult the following section to clarify the diagramming symbology.
      </p>
      
      <h4>ENTITIES</h4>
      
      <p>Entities are concepts within the data model.  Each entity is represented by a box within the ERD.  Entities are abstract concepts,
         each representing one or more instances of the concept in question. An entity might be considered a container that holds all
         of the instances of a particular thing in a system.  Entities are equivalent to database tables in a relational database,
         with each row of the table representing an instance of that entity.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Remember that each entity represents a container for instances of the thing in question.  The diagram below has an entity
         for <i>student</i> and another for <i>school</i>. This indicates that the system being modeled may contain one or more students and one or more schools.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc01.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>So far, no relationship between students and schools has been indicated.</p>
      
      
      
      <h4>RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
      
      <p>Relationships are represented by lines between entities.  Relationship lines indicate that each instance of an entity may
         have a relationship with instances of the connected entity, and vice versa.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc02.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The diagram above now indicates that students may have some relationship with schools.  More specifically, there may be a
         relationship between a particular student (an instance of the student entity) and a particular school (an instance of the
         school entity).
      </p>
      
      <p>If necessary, a relationship line may be labeled to define the relationship.  In this case, one can infer that a student may
         attend a school, or that a school may enroll students.  But if necessary, this relationship could be labeled for clarification:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc03.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>Read the first relationship definition, <i>attends</i>, when tracing the relationship left to right or top to bottom.  Read the second definition, <i>enrolls</i>, when tracing the relationship right to left or bottom to top.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>OPTIONALITY AND CARDINALITY</h4>
      
      <p>Symbols at the ends of the relationship lines indicate the <i>optionality</i> and the <i>cardinality</i> of each relationship. Optionality expresses whether the relationship is optional or mandatory. "Cardinality" expresses the
         maximum number of relationships.
      </p>
      
      <p>As a relationship line is followed from an entity to another, near the related entity two symbols will appear. The first of
         those is the optionality indicator. A circle ( ( ) indicates that the relationship is optional--the minimum number of relationships
         between each instance of the first entity and instances of the related entity is zero. One can think of the circle as a zero,
         or a letter "O" for optional. A stroke ( | ) indicates that the relationship is mandatory--the minimum number of relationships
         between each instance of the first entity and instances of the related entity is one.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The second symbol indicates cardinality. A stroke ( | ) indicates that the maximum number of relationships is one. A crow's-foot
          (<img src="images/dlfermi0408appc04.gif">) indicates that many such relationships between instances of the related entities might exist.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following diagram indicates all of the possible combinations:</p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc05.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>In our model, we wish to indicate that each school may enroll many students, or may not enroll any students at all.  We also
         wish to indicate that each student attends exactly one school.  The following diagram indicates this optionality and cardinality:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc06.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>It is important to note that relationship optionality and cardinality constraints apply specifically to the system being modeled,
         not to all possible systems.  According to the example modeled above, a school might not enroll any students--that relationship
         is optional.  A school without students is not much of a school, and indeed if the system being modeled were a school system
         enrollment database, the relationship would probably be mandatory.  However, if the system being modeled is an extracurricular
         honors program, there may be schools that have no students currently participating in the program.  Consider the function
         of the system and consult the other documents in the data model to clarify modeling decisions.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <h4>BRIDGE ENTITIES</h4>
      
      <p>When an instance of an entity may be related to multiple instances of another entity and vice versa, that is called a <i>many-to-many</i> relationship. In the example below, a supplier may provide many different products, and each type of product may be offered
         by many suppliers:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc07.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>While this relationship model is perfectly valid, it cannot be translated directly into a relational database design.  In
         a relational database, relationships are expressed by keys in a table column that point to the correct instance in the related
         table.  A many-to-many relationship does not allow this relationship expression, because each record in each table might have
         to point to multiple records in the other table.
      </p>
      
      <p>In order to build a relational database that captures this relationship, it is necessary to build a bridge between the two
         entities that uniquely expresses each relationship instance.  This can be modeled in an ERD with a <i>bridge entity</i>, an entity box containing a diamond, which may replace the many-to-many relationship. (The diamond is used in other ER modeling
         systems to indicate relationships, or may be viewed as the joining--the bridge--of the many-to-many crow's-feet).
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc08.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>This diagram expresses the same relationship as the diagram above.  Each instance of the <i>provides</i> bridge entity indicates that a certain supplier can provide a certain product.
      </p>
      
      <p>In addition to explicitly depicting a relational database structure that can capture a many-to-many relationship, the bridge
         entity has an additional function in abstract entity-relationship modeling: A bridge entity may capture attributes that are
         specific to the relationship between instances of the bridged entities. In the supplier and product example, a product does
         not have an inherent cost; it only has a cost in relation to the supplier who sells it. Similarly, a supplier may not have
         a uniform delivery time; delivery times may vary in relation to the product being delivered. Any attributes that are dependent
         on the relationship would be associated with the relationship's bridge entity.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIPS</h4>
      
      <p>Instances of entities may have relationships with other instances of the same entity.  These relationships may be drawn with
         relationship lines that begin and end connected to the same entity. Common occurrences of these recursive relationships include
         parent/child relationships:
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc09.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The diagram above indicates that a person may be the father of zero or many persons, and that a person may have zero or one
         father. (Not every person's father will be recorded in the system, so the relationship is modeled as optional).
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENTITIES</h4>
      
      <p>An entity may have multiple relationships with another entity.  These are depicted in the ERD with multiple relationship lines
         connecting the two entities:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc10.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The diagram above indicates that an employee may be the salesperson assigned to zero or many clients, and an employee may
         be the customer service representative for zero or many clients.  Each client has exactly one salesperson and exactly one
         customer service representative.  Each client's salesperson may or may not be the same employee as the client's customer service
         representative; each relationship is treated independently.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>ENTITY SUBTYPES</h4>
      
      <p>There are times when it is convenient to depict relationships that apply to an entire class of things, as well as depict relationships
         that apply only to certain types of the larger class.  Entity subtypes accommodate these relationship depictions.  In the
         ERD, entity subtypes may be depicted by entity boxes shown within larger entity boxes.  The large entity represents the class,
         and the smaller boxes depict the subtypes.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc11.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The example above depicts an <i>inventory</i> entity, with the subtypes of <i>vehicle</i> and <i>part</i>. A vehicle has one or many parts, and every part is associated with one and only one kind of vehicle (according to this diagram,
         there are no interchangeable components).  All items in inventory, whether they are vehicles or parts, have a manufacturing
         location, but only vehicles are of a particular model.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>EXCLUSIVE-OR RELATIONSHIP</h4>
      
      <p>If an entity instance may have either one relationship or another, but not both, the constraint may be modeled with an <i>exclusive-or</i> relationship, represented as a tree with a solid dot where the tree branches.  The entity attached to the trunk of the tree
         is the one subject to the exclusive-or constraint.  No relationship is indicated between entities attached the branches.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc12.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The diagram above indicates that each convict is assigned to a prison, or to a parole officer, but not both.  A prison may
         have zero or many convicts, a parole officer may have zero or many convicts, and there is no relationship between prisons
         and parole officers.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>INCLUSIVE-OR RELATIONSHIP</h4>
      
      <p>If an entity instance may have either one or more relationships, but must have at least one of the possible relationships,
         the constraint may be modeled with an <i>inclusive-or</i>, represented as a tree with a hollow dot where the tree branches.  As with the exclusive-or constraint, the entity attached
         to the trunk of the tree is the one subject to the constraint, and the entities attached to the branches are not related to
         one another by this construction.

         <h3>Additional Inheritance Constraints</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Unlike other modeling systems, entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) do not explicitly depict situations in which entity instances
         are expected to inherit attributes or relationships of related entity instances.
      </p>
      
      <p>This data model assumes the following relationship inheritance constraints:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>An e-resource may inherit its interface's relationship with an acquisition, administrative information, or access information.
             Alternatively, the e-resource may have a separate acquisition, administrative information, and/or access information from
            its interface.
         </li>
         
         <li>An e-resource must inherit its interface's relationship or relationships with licenses (and with the terms defined by the
            interface's licenses--although different terms from a different license may prevail for the e-resource).
         </li>
         
         <li>An e-resource may inherit its parent e-resource's relationship with an acquisition, administrative information, or access
            information.  Alternatively, the child e-resource may have a separate acquisition, administrative information, and/or access

         <h3>Explanation of Complex Relationships or Concepts</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Although the overall diagram is large and complex, most of the entities and relationships depicted in the ERD are relatively
         straightforward, and can be fully understood in consultation with the definitions provided in Appendix D (Data Element Dictionary)
         and Appendix E (Data Structure).
      </p>
      
      <p>Several of the relationships depicted merit further explanation.</p>
      
      <h4>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT AND ITS SUBTYPES</h4>
      
      <p>The <i>electronic product</i> entity represents electronic things that may be acquired, licensed, or managed.  Electronic product encompasses interfaces,
         e-resource packages, packages of packages, and individual e-resource titles.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc15.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>Many attributes and relationships are shared by all electronic products, regardless of whether the electronic product is an
         interface, package, or individual title. For example, all types of electronic products may be licensed, may be acquired, may
         undergo a product trial, etc.  On the other hand, interfaces and e-resources do have some unique characteristics and in certain
         cases need to be handled in distinct ways.  The electronic product entity and its subtypes accommodate the depiction of these
         relationships.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>E-RESOURCE RECURSIVE RELATIONSHIP</h4>
      
      <p>The <i>e-resource</i> entity represents e-resource packages, packages of packages, and individual e-resource titles.  Any given e-resource title
         may be a standalone product, or may be a part of an e-resource package.  An e-resource package could in turn be part of a
         larger package.  These possible relationships are accommodated with the optional recursive relationship for e-resources:

      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc16.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>THE ORGANIZATION ENTITY</h4>
      
      <p>The <i>organization</i> entity represents any business, vendor, provider, publisher, licensor, etc. with which a library does business related to
         electronic products.  Generally, one records the same attributes of an organization, such as name and address, regardless
         of the role the organization plays.  Furthermore, a single organization frequently fills several roles in the e-resource management
         environment, functioning as vendor, licensor, publisher, and/or provider.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Rather than create separate entities for each role, which may contain duplicate instances of one another, the model contains
         the single organization entity, with the role or roles of the organization dependent on the relationship or relationships
         in which the organization participates:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc17.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>For definitions of the roles indicated by these relationships, see Appendix D (Data Element Dictionary) and Appendix E (Data
         Structure).
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>TERMS DEFINED AND PREVAILING TERMS</h4>
      
      <p>Each license and each acquisition defines (or may define) a set of associated rights and restrictions on the usage and management
         of the electronic products covered by the license or acquisition.  In some cases, certain terms are defined in licenses, while
         in other agreements those same term concepts might be defined in the business agreement.  To accommodate the uncertainty of
         where certain rights, responsibilities, and other terms might be defined in any given situation, we have modeled a separate
         <i>terms defined</i> entity:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc18.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The terms defined entity is able to record all possible rights, responsibilities, and other terms, including terms that are
         typically defined in licenses (such as "interlibrary loan" or "scholarly sharing" permissions), as well as terms that are
         typically defined in acquisitions or business terms (such as "number of concurrent users").
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         Each acquisition may define at most one terms defined instance.  Each license may define at most one terms defined instance.
          Each terms defined instance is defined either by one acquisition or by one license; this relationship is modeled using the
         exclusive-or relationship.
      </p>
      
      <p>Use, rights, and restrictions for any given e-resource may be governed by multiple agreements, both legal license terms and
         negotiated acquisition terms.  Each acquisition defines one set of terms, and each license defines one set of terms.  Through
         each electronic product's relationship with an acquisition and its relationship with one or more licenses, one can find all
         of the terms defined instances that apply to each e-resource.
      </p>
      
      <p>It may occur that among several terms defined instances that apply to a given electronic product, some of the individual terms
         are in conflict; this is especially likely in situations where multiple license agreements cover a single electronic product.
          In such cases it is necessary to determine which of the conflicting terms prevail for the electronic product in question.
          This is modeled with the <i>prevailing terms</i> entity, and its relationships with the terms defined entity:
      </p>
      
      <p>
         <p align="center"><img src="images/dlfermi0408appc19.gif"></p>
      </p>
      
      <p>The prevailing terms entity represents all possible terms, just as the terms defined entity does, but for each term merely
         points to the terms defined entity that prevails.  The four relationship lines depicted in the drawing actually represent
         many relationships: one for each defined term.  So while each electronic product may be governed by many different acquisitions
         and licenses that define terms, each electronic product is governed by at most one complete set of prevailing terms.

         <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>This entity relationship diagram depicts the major concepts and relationships needed for managing e-resources.  It is neither
         a complete data model depicting every necessary relational database table, nor is it meant to be a proscriptive design for
         implementations of ERM systems.  Alternate models may capture the necessary attributes and relationships.  Hopefully this
         document, along with the other components of the <i>Report of the DLF Electronic Resource Management Initiative</i> will assist developers with envisioning the complexity of the environment that an ERM system must address, and ensure that
         crucial relationships and features will be included in ERM products.

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>In the context of the DLF ERMI work, the Data Element Dictionary serves as a basic reference document. It compliments the
         Data Structure (Appendix E), which expresses the attributes and relationships between the data elements, and the Entity Relationship
         Diagram (Appendix C), which defines relationships between concepts that exist between groupings of data elements in a system.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Data Element Dictionary has a very simple structure, consisting of four items. The <i>data element name</i> is the full name given to each element in the Dictionary. The <i>identifier</i> is the name by which other programs will identify a particular element. For example, the element "E-Product Role" will be
         called "eprole" when used in an XML schema. The data element <i>definitions</i> describe each element. Every effort was made to write the element names and definitions in compliance with ISO 11179, <i>Specification and Standardization of Data Elements</i>. The Data Element Dictionary also includes an optional <i>comments</i> column, which offers examples for data element values or describes situations in which these data elements might be used.
         This section also identifies other standards from which a particular data element has taken its definition, or it may recommend
         that a particular standard be used when entering a value for that element into an ERM system.

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>This document is a data structure and supporting tool for understanding and interpreting the interaction between the Entity
         Relationship Diagram and the Data Elements Dictionary. The Data Structure maps the elements defined in the Data Elements Dictionary
         into the entities defined by the Entity Relationship Diagram in a way that supports the functional specifications delineated
         in the Functional Requirements and the workflow described in the Workflow Flowchart document. As part of a data model, the
         Data Structure is not intended to be absolutely prescriptive. System designers should feel free to develop their own approach
         to integrating the elements and entities. However, designers are cautioned from deviating too widely from the concepts of
         the below approach, as any deviations will need to be transformable for the purposes of data sharing and migration.
      </p>
      
      <p>The following pieces of information may be helpful in understanding the presentation of the data model in the Electronic Resource
         Management System Data Structure.
      </p>
      
      <p>Data Elements and Definitions are extracted from the Data Element Dictionary with as little variation as possible. However,
         some elements that are duplicates of others in concept (e.g. elements in the Prevailing Terms entity), or pointers, which
         are in essence a reference to another entity, may not be listed in the Data Element Dictionary.
      </p>
      
      <p>Element Types are restricted to text, numeric, logical, date, unique ID, or pointers. Unique IDs are only used for the record
         identifiers in each entity. Pointers are ID elements from another entity which either supply information from that other entity
         where needed in the one containing the pointer, or which establish a type of relationship. For example, a one-to-many relationship
         requires the listing of a pointer to the ID from the "one" side of the equation in the entity of the "many" side of the equation.
      </p>
      
      <p>System Use / Functionality is used to describe ways the system software may use or need to treat the element or the expected
         functionality the element is expected to fulfill. References to the outline of the Functional Requirements are made either
         in the Notes of an entity (for those specifications that the entire entity fulfills) or in the System Use / Functionality
         area. Functional Requirement outline references are made in the following form: FR#.# and those not recorded in this area
         are annotated in the Appendix Notes. Not all functional uses of every element are spelled out, but the annotation in the Data
         Structure is intended to point out the integration of the data model with the Functional Requirements document. Another use
         of this System Use / Functionality area is to record the binding of paired or grouped elements. Some pairs or groups are simply
         logical associations, as when the unit of measure should be attached to the element recording the item being measured. Other
         pairs or groups are functional necessities, as when the pair or group repeats as a pair or group and is actually a surrogate
         representation of a separate nested table of elements.
      </p>
      
      <p>Values record the suggested possible entries for an element, or the suggested possible layout of such entries. A few value
         lists of extensive length are recorded as appendices. System implementers may use alternate terminology as appropriate.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Optionality area records whether an element is required. The key to the abbreviations is:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>R = Required</li>
         
         <li>RA = Required if Applicable</li>
         
         <li>O = Optional</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>The Repeatability area supplies information on the unique or repeating nature of the element.</p>
      
      <p>The Notes / Examples area provides a space to clarify further details about the element or raise issues that are still unresolved.</p>
      
      <p>A number of entities with lengthy lists of elements are separated into Groups for the sake of convenience and clarity. There
         is no functional purpose to the groupings and they may be ignored for the purpose of system design structures.
      </p>
      
      <p>The terms <i>electronic product</i> and <i>electronic resource</i> have been shortened to <i>e-product</i> and <i>e-resource</i> throughout this document for brevity's sake; refer to the Data Dictionary, Appendix D, for full element names.

      <ul>
         
         <li><i>Electronic resource (Electronic resource)</i>: May require multiple iterations by format, if format has license/acquisition detail implications.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Terms</i>: For those terms designated RA, some institutions may not want to track. The Data Structure only attempts to suggest Optionality,
            but there should certainly be leeway between R, RA, and O as a system is developed.
         </li>
         
         <li><i>Country of implementation</i>: The authors recognize that our collective area of experience is limited to the practice of ERM in libraries of the United
            States. We have tried to generalize elements for non- country specific use or indicate where elements may be solely of interest
            or use to U.S. libraries, but we have not attempted to map the universe of elements of interest to the practice of electronic
            resource management in other countries.  System designers desiring to build products for international use should keep this
            in mind and research functional requirements beyond the United States.

         <li><i>Functional Requirement</i> items not mapped above:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>FR3 is not mapped above on the assumption that there is a higher level capability with system usernames that will permit view
                  and editing of any grouping of the elements individually or together.
               </li>
               
               <li>FR4 is not mapped above on the assumption that there is a higher level capability to accomplish reports.</li>
               
               <li>FR12 implies connections between the above and other systems such as LMSs. There are indications in the above where such connections
                  would be most logical or useful, but not all of them are fully annotated.
               </li>

               <li>FR41.8 implies a sophisticated and calculable method for storing incidents and recording incident start and end times. This
                  detailed functionality is not mapped in this document.

               <li>In order to facilitate FR42.4, the incident log functionality will need to record contact id for the appropriate vendor contact.</li>
               
               <li>FR43.4.2 only applies where ERMS is interconnected with an LMS. The connection of which print cancellations to block would
                  happen through the print version entity.
               </li>
               
               <li>FR43.5.2 implies integration with a payment system where historical payment data is recorded and can be used as the basis

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </center>
      
      
      <p>The scope of the DLF ERMI is wide-ranging, from a very large list of relevant data elements to workflow diagrams, functional
         requirements, and an abstract entity-relationship view of an ideal system.  To round out the suite of deliverables the ERMI
         Steering Group felt it important to explore the use of XML as a wrapper for ERMI data elements.  Within the library world,
         Roy Tennant may be the most vocal proponent of XML. In his editorial, "MARC Must Die," Tennant asserts that libraries risk
         technology fossilization unless they adopt XML as a replacement for the MARC standard (Tennant 2002a).  In a follow-up piece,
         "MARC Exit Strategies," Tennant offers three strategies for moving from MARC to XML: (1) entombment--build a new parallel
         system along side MARC systems; (2) encapsulation--move MARC records into an XML structure such as MODS; or (3) migration--move
         everything into a new XML structure (Tennant 2002b).  Tennant is not a lone voice in advocating the use of XML. The "Death
         of MARC" made the top of the ALA Library Information Technology Association's Top Trends in 2003. Work is underway in pushing
         this vision forward. For example, <i>XML in Libraries</i>, edited by Tennant, describes 13 innovative XML-based library projects.  Kyle Banerjee's "How Does XML Help Libraries?" is
         another article advocating a transition to XML (Banerjee 2002). The point here is that XML is making significant inroads in
         libraries.  Libraries are clearly in the midst of a transition from an environment with one primary exchange standard for
         bibliographic metadata (MARC) to one where specific application metadata (some bibliographic, some for administration) are
         exchanged according to a variety of standards, all packaged in XML.  In the near future we will see ERM systems deployed across
         libraries.  When that day comes, there will be a need for libraries to exchange XML data between other libraries, vendors,
         and from one software migration to the next.

         <h3>Method</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The steering group formed an XML subgroup in fall 2003 and followed two threads: (1) a prototype schema, and (2) possible
         use cases. To start, Robin Wendler created a partially completed ERMI XML schema module that would use or refer to extant
         XML schemas and/or semantics such as DC, MODS, VCard, etc, available from <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/cts/elicensestudy/dlfdeliverables/fallforum2003/ermitest-rkw2.xsd">http://www.library.cornell.edu/cts/elicensestudy/dlfdeliverables/fallforum2003/ermitest-rkw2.xsd</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>The use cases the subgroup imagined in the first round of our discussions included:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>* Link resolver data exchange between vendor and library. Possible elements: title, title level coverage, and user group license
               terms;
            </li>
            
            <li>* Publisher e-resource title list. Possible elements include title, package name, title level coverage, discounts, and ISSN;
               and
            </li>
            
            <li>* Possible exchange of data between the library ERM system and other campus systems such as course Web sites.</li>
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         In January 2004, the steering group discussed the scope of the ongoing XML exploration and decided that it was too ambitious
         given the short amount of time available. Instead, the XML sub-group focused on creating a proof-of-concept schema that would
         be restricted to licensing-only data elements.  Issues such as exchange of title level descriptive metadata within an XML
         container, while important, are better addressed in a separate, more specific initiative, such as the NISO/EDItEUR Joint Working
         Party for the Exchange of Serials Subscription Information (JWP).
      </p>
      
      <p>Angela Riggio and Sharon Farb designed two relatively simple use cases, which both put the emphasis on exchanging license
         data. The <i>quick fix</i> use case (table 1) is a small list of elements which might be exchanged between librarians that need to communicate some
         essential details about a particular e-resource package.  The second license-agreement use case (table 2) is a larger and
         more comprehensive list of elements, but the purpose is the same: to provide a vehicle for the exchange of metadata between
         libraries or consortia. Once we had restricted our attention to the two narrow use cases, we turned to developments in the
         dynamic and very complex fields of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Rights Expression Languages (RELs), since it seemed
         that requirements for the expressions of license terms and digital rights might be similar. We reasoned that if existing rights
         expression languages could be used for license term expression, we could avoid reinventing the wheel.

         <h3>Digital Rights Management and Rights Expression Languages</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>Karen Coyle's "The Technology of Rights: Digital Rights Management" provides us with an insightful and readable overview of
         DRM.  Coyle begins the discussion by drawing a distinction between "thin copyright" and "thick copyright." The goal of thin
         copyright is to make works widely available to the public. The goal of thick copyright owners is to maximize profit. The core
         motivation behind DRM is the fact that making copies of digital works is trivial. Copyright, even thick copyright cannot technically
         prevent these copies from being made.  DRM technology is based on the notion that digital works can and need to be protected
         by linking the rights to a work to a particular identification key.  The first generation of DRM systems match the rights
         to use a work to a particular machine, such as an eBook reader. Second generation systems theoretically match the rights to
         a work to a particular person. Mike Godwin defines digital rights management as "technologies that prevent you from using
         copyrighted digital work beyond the degree to which the copyright owner wishes to allow you to use it" (Godwin 2003). (Microsoft's
         next generation operating system is expected to include DRM.)
      </p>
      
      <p>The rules governing DRM technology are represented in a REL, "a different kind of language; it is a formal language like mathematics
         or like programming code; it is language that can be executed as an algorithm," (Coyle 2003). RELs work best with attributes
         that can be counted, i.e., time, units, or value exchange. In addition, Coyle notes that "where copyright law is an expression
         of 'everything that is not forbidden is permitted,' DRM takes the approach of 'everything that is not permitted is forbidden'."
         As a consequence, DRM and fair use as practiced in libraries may be incompatible.

      <p>Coyle has written a more recent report, "Rights Expression Languages: A Report for the Library of Congress," that according
         to Sally H. McCallum of the Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office was "commissioned to clarify
         the similarities and differences of various emerging RELs in order to assist users in making choices and to encourage cooperation
         among developers of the languages where feasible." It surveys the XML RELs from Creative Commons (CC), METSRights (METSR),
         Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) and MPEG-21 Part 5 (MPEG-21/5).  According to Coyle, each REL surveyed is designed for
         a specific purpose, and as a consequence, there will never be a universal REL. She offers the following insight on the relationship
         between RELs and fair use:
         
         <blockquote>
            Rights expression languages that are intended to be machine-actionable are expressly not intended to implement copyright law.
            Although some early researchers hoped to use RELs to express (and enforce) legal concepts like "fair use," that has not been
            the case in actual implementations. The copyright law, although carefully worded, simply cannot be expressed in the kind of
            algorithmic language that is required by computer programs to automate functionality like printing or copying. This is especially
            true of the key concept of "fair use." Fair use is a deliberately vague exception to the monopoly rights of the copyright
            holder. It says essentially that--although the copyright holder has the exclusive right to make copies of the work--members
            of the public can also make copies if their use is "fair." There is no a priori test for whether a use is fair; each such
            exercise of the public's right must be carefully scrutinized taking into account a number of factors. Even after such scrutiny,
            not everyone will agree on what is fair. Electronic systems need an unambiguous and quantitative definition that they can
            act on, and the copyright law does not provide that (Coyle 2004, p. 11).
            
         </blockquote>
         As Coyle observes above, from a technical standpoint, fair use is difficult if not impossible to truly represent within a
         REL. More broadly, Lawrence Lessig argues in <i>Free Culture</i> that the electronic environment has in fact severely limited the available nonregulated uses of intellectual property. This
         is in part a consequence of a change in copyright law that eliminated the requirement that a work include a &copy; symbol; that
         is, everything is now assumed to be copyrighted unless explicitly stated otherwise.  Uses that were once unregulated are now
         regulated. Furthermore, within the electronic environment a copy is made each time a file is transferred; copy-and-paste may,
         in certain instances, be interpreted as a crime in this regulated system. In Lessig's view the reality of fair use today is
         that one must have a lawyer on retainer in order to make use of it; the scales are tipped overwhelming in favor of the copyright
         owner (Lessig 2004, pp. 116 - 173). We are quickly moving towards a fair use free world where copyright owners can simply
         assert control upfront within a DRM.
      </p>
      
      <p>These considerations led the group to carefully consider whether or not to pursue the use of an existing REL, and if so, which
         one. Two of the better-established RELs described by Coyle, currently vie for recognition as the standard for media products
         such as movies in DVD format. The first of these is now referred to as MPEG-21/5, and grew out of the XrML language developed
         by a company named ContentGuard. ContentGuard is jointly

         controlled by Microsoft and Time Warner (Time Warner, 2004). The second is called the Open Digital Rights Language, or ODRL.
         These initiatives are intended both to enable a rights holder to describe what a user may do with a particular resource <i>and</i> to confer substantial control of user behavior on the implementing party. The XML group learned of the existence of extensive
         patent claims related to MPEG-21/5, and its strong preference for open standards led it to focus its work on use of ODRL.

      <h4>	OPEN DIGITAL RIGHTS LANGUAGE (ODRL)</h4>
      
      <p>What happens when ERMI data elements are placed within the ODRL framework?  The following is a high-level description:
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) Initiative is an international effort of Supporters aimed at developing an open standard
               for the DRM sector and promoting the language at standards bodies.
            </li>
            
            <li>The ODRL specification supports an extensible language and vocabulary (data dictionary) for the expression of terms and conditions
               over any content including permissions, constraints, requirements, conditions, and offers and agreements with rights holders.
            </li>
            
            <li>ODRL is intended to provide flexible and interoperable mechanisms to support transparent and innovative use of digital resources
               in publishing, distributing and consuming of digital media across all sectors including publishers, education, entertainment,
               mobile, and software. ODRL also supports protected digital content and honors the rights, conditions and fees specified for
               digital contents (ODRL).
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         Our approach was to first mark up our use cases in ODRL Version 1.1 XML and then to create an ODRL schema supplement to validate
         them (figure 5). (The products of our ODRL experiment are figure 2, figure 4, and figure 5.) ODRL is a rich pre-defined data
         model. As a result, everything must fit into the model. Therefore, the first step in putting the ERMI elements into ODRL is
         to map the ERMI elements in the use case to the existing ODRL data dictionary. If the semantic content is the same, then the
         expectation is to use the existing element within the ODRL data dictionary thus enhancing the potential for interoperability.
         We offer the following observations on the results of this exercise:
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         
         <ul>
            
            <li>1. The learning curve for using ODRL is steep. It is possible that accurate creation of our ODRL versions of the ERMI XML
               use cases and the associated ODRL XML schema might not have been completed without the generous assistance of Renato Iannella
               and Susanne Guth of the ODRL Initiative. If ODRL were to be used widely for exchanging metadata between different ERM systems,
               this cost would be internalized by the libraries and vendors.
            </li>
            
            <li>2. The ERMI/ODRL schema we have created can only validate the form of the XML document, not the syntax or semantics of the
               values in the XML. For example, in figure 2, &#12296;ermi:assumed-permission&#12297; is actually a type of ODRL "permissionElement", as
               referenced in our supplement to the ODRL schema, figure 5. As such, it is not possible to define our new &#12296;ermi:assumed-permission&#12297;
               element in such a way to make only particular values valid.  Any string would be valid.  Iannella informed us after reading
               an earlier draft of this report that it is possible to validate more closely (Iannella 2004). He said, "You can support this
               by defining &#12296;ermi:assumed-permission&#12297; as a *restriction* of permissionType and then defining all the subelements that you
               want to limit to. (This is a strong feature of XML Schema.)"&#12296;/item&#12297;
               &#12296;item&#12297;3. ODRL does not allow the communication of negative values. For example, figure 1 is a very simple XML markup of some
               licensing elements. One of these elements is called &#12296;perpetualaccessright&#12297;undetermined&#12296;/perpetualaccessright&#12297;.  The value
               in this element, "undetermined," represents the idea that we don't always interpret everything in a license when it is signed,
               but if we were exchanging data between two libraries we would want to know that the answer to this question is essentially,
               "we don't know." ODRL does not permit this kind of communication.  As you can see in figure 2, this element has been commented
               out.  There was discussion about the lack of a "not" operator at the ODRL International Workshop held in Vienna in April,
               2004.  It appears that work will be underway to make that possible in ODRL Version 2.0 (ODRL Workshop 2004).
            </li>
            
            <li>4. ODRL can only express customer rights and duties but not those pertaining to the rights holder. ODRL is moving to address
               this shortcoming. Guth presented a paper at the recent ODRL Workshop describing the need for ODRL to express rights and duties
               for both parties (Guth and Strembeck 2004).
            </li>
            
         </ul>
         It is worth observing that our frustration trying to work with negative, or interpreted, values in ODRL can be placed in the
         broader context of twenty-first century international property rights, as described by Christopher May. He writes, "one of
         the key elements of the 'problem' of DRM is therefore the solidification of aspects of copyright law which have hitherto been
         amenable to a certain amount of indeterminacy, which is to say there have been areas of legal grayness" (May 2003). With an
         REL like ODRL or XrML, there can be only black and white. ODRL appears to picture the contracts which define the relationships
         as a series of checkboxes rather than a complex legal document written in somewhat creative English, suggesting a very different
         view of information than that of
         
         
         <hr width="75%">
         <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
         
         ERMI. Our experience trying to fit ERMI elements into ODRL makes it clear that more would be given up than gained by using
         it for our purpose. ODRL was designed for use cases very different than ours.
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>ERMI CREATIVE COMMONS CC RDF</h4>
      
      <p>Our experience attempting to work with ODRL raised a number of issues which led us to look for an REL that might better fit
         our needs. (The products of our CC RDF experiment are figure 6, figure 7, and figure 8.) The CC RDF license description approach
         attracted us. We were intrigued by the philosophy behind the Creative Commons, which is close to the traditional fair use
         ethic among librarians. Though the CC RDF is a REL, it is not intended to serve as a language to be embedded into a control
         structure that would lock down the content. On the contrary, "unlike Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology, which tries
         to restrict use of digital works, Creative Commons is providing ways to encourage permitted sharing and reuse of works" (CC
         Why). In contrast to ODRL, CC RDF is less rich, but also less constraining. With the Creative Commons approach, information
         is not lost. However, it is not clear what is gained. Certainly one of the purposes of an XML schema must be to validate the
         structure and data types within a particular XML document. Our CC RDF schema cannot really validate the syntax of an XML document.
         This is no fault of CC RDF: it was designed as a structure for content owners to place--with some qualifications--their content
         into the public domain. Our experience trying to adapt the CC RDF schema to our needs does not preclude the possibility of
         using the technology of RDF, but substantial work would be required and the benefits seem unclear. <i>Note</i> that in a related context, a recent RoMEO project study on rights metadata for open archiving recommends Creative Commons
         over ODRL (RoMEO Study 6).
      </p>
      
      
      
      <h4>ERMI <i>NATIVE</i> SCHEMAS
      </h4>
      
      <p>The third approach is a scaled down variation of where we started in the fall of 2003; we would use our own ERMI namespace
         exclusively and design two simple XML schemas, one for each use case. (The products of our ERMI <i>native</i> schema experiment are figure 9, figure 10, figure 11, and figure 12.) Following our experiments with ODRL and Creative Commons
         we learned that the costs of using an existing REL are higher than they may appear on the surface. Our native schema simply
         takes the existing ERMI data elements and treats them as their own namespace. No effort is made to try to map the elements
         to another namespace. As a consequence, ERMI native schemas offer the most rigid syntax for validation, and also happen to
         be the most compact.

         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      </center>
      
      <p>The momentum to build ERM systems for libraries is building, and we will soon reach a point where there is a specific need
         for exchanging data between these systems. What the ERMI Steering Group envisioned and expressed in our two use cases is simply
         the exchange of metadata between two library entities.
      </p>
      
      
      <hr width="75%">
      <p align="center"><i>--</i></p>
      
      
      <p>Based on our investigation, we believe that placing ERMI metadata within an XML container would best be achieved without using
         a formal REL. Instead, using our own specific native schemas offers the best cost-benefit ratio. We have no desire to control
         the associated content--unlike, for example, in the case of a recording studio that is trying to lock down the latest Britney
         Spears release. Since we do not need to lock down the content, why bring along all the baggage that a commercially-oriented
         REL requires for those other purposes?
      </p>
      
      <p>Nevertheless, it will probably be worthwhile to continue to monitor related initiatives. For example, more can be learned
         and gained from studying ODRL. Based on the positive experience we had working with Iannella, it is clear that he and others
         involved in ODRL development are interested in having their REL evolve to better accommodate the needs of all parties. There
         may also be some parallels between the need for an ERMI XML specification and the approach take by Publishing Requirements
         for Industry Standard Metadata (PRISM). According to Coyle, PRISM is "a good example of a REL that was developed for a specific
         situation where a more general rights language was not necessary" (Coyle 2004, p. 13). As Rick Silterra puts it, "We're looking
         for exchangeability, but not necessarily actionability."
      </p>
      
      <p>William Moen says that a "standard represents an agreement by a community to do things in a specified way to address a common
         problem." In fact, he goes on to say, "developing standards can be viewed as a community-centric endeavor. It is first and
         foremost a social process" (Moen 2003, pp. 4, 5). Librarians should think very carefully about what they are trying to accomplish
         in the new ERM context, and take note of the caution delivered at the W3C Workshop on DRM for the Web in 2001, "There is some
         anxiety that the current balance may be off and that actual privileges (like those of Libraries) are not supported in such
         a system" (W3C DRM Workshop 2001). Until balance is achieved, we recommend that librarians and vendors pick out particular
         elements from the ERMI data dictionary and build a custom schema for validation. Other namespaces, such as Dublin Core, could
         be mixed in where appropriate. These application profiles could be posted to a Web site or registry and used as is or modified
         where needed (Heery 2000).
