<h2>Digital libraries and their challenges</h2>

D Greenstein<br />
7 July 2000 

<p>This article derives from a review of key challenges
confronted by libraries that are actively investing in online
collections and services. Conducted in the first instance to help
refine the programmatic goals of the Digital Library Federation
(DLF), it took account of the digital library developments,
successes, needs and challenges perceived by professionals
working at the DLF's 24 member libraries.[<a href="#n1">1</a>]
Methodologically, the review relied on two research tracks. The
first involved desk-based research into the strategic
documentation and technical reports that inform members' work in
this area. The second involved extensive discussions convened at
some 27 sites. [<a href="#n2">2</a>]</p>

<p>After a brief summary of some of the digital library's key
functions - definitions of the digital library are possibly
premature and will anyway under-represent the extent to which its
activities are shaped by local institutional, legal, and business
imperatives - the article reviews five key challenges offering
some thoughts about how each may be confronted in future.</p>

<center>i</center>

<p>The digital library extends the breadth and scale of scholarly
and cultural evidence and supports innovative research and
life-long learning. To do this, it mediates between diverse and
distributed information resources on the one hand and a changing
range of user communities on the other. In this capacity, it
establishes "a digital library service environment" - that is, a
networked, online information space in which users can discover,
locate, acquire access to and, increasingly, use information.
Although access paths will vary depending upon the resource in
question, the digital library service environment makes no
distinctions among information formats. Books, journals,
paper-based archives, video, film, and sound recordings are as
visible in the digital library service environment as are online
catalogs, finding aids, abstract and indexing services, e-journal
and e-print services, digitized collections, geographic
information systems, Internet resources, and other "electronic"
holdings.</p>

<p>In constructing a digital library service environment, the
library becomes responsible for configuring access to a world of
information of which it owns or manages only a part. Accordingly,
the digital library is known less for the extent and nature of
the collections it owns than for the networked information space
it defines through its online services. In the world of
commercial publishing, aggregators compete on the basis of the
value-added services that they layer on top of overlapping
electronic collections. Similarly, digital libraries establish
their distinctive identities, serve their user communities,
emphasize their owned collections, and promote their unique
institutional objectives by the way in which they disclose,
provide access to, and support the use of their increasingly
virtual collections.</p>

<p>The digital library service environment is not simply about
access to and use of information. It also supports the full range
of administrative, business and curatorial functions required by
the library to manage, administer, monitor engagement with, and
ensure fair use of its collections whether in digital or
non-digital formats, whether located locally or off site. The
digital library service environment integrates (and interfaces
with) information repositories that are characterized by
open-access shelving, high-density book stores and availability
via inter-library loan, and include data services and digital
archival repositories. It manages information about collections
and items within collections often throughout their entire life
cycle. It incorporates patron, lending, and other databases, and
integrates appropriate procedures for user registration,
authentication, authorization, and fee-transaction processing.
The digital library service environment may also evolve into a
networked learning space, providing access to and a curatorial
home for distance and life-long learning materials. The digital
library service environment is, in sum, an electronic information
space that supports very different views and very different uses
of the library. It is designed for the library's patrons as well
as for its professional staff and with an eye on the needs and
capacities of those who supply it with information content and
systems. It is built in the full knowledge that information
technologies will continue to change rapidly as will our
understanding of how they can be used to support education and
cultural engagement. Finally it is evolving as the library's
defining function and as such is developed with a view to its
financial and organizational sustainability.</p>

<center>ii</center>

<p><i>Architectural and systems challenges</i></p>

<p>The digital library typically relies upon a narrow base of
appropriately skilled professionals to keep abreast of the rapid
pace of technical change while maintaining, indeed extending,
robust and fully operational online services and collections. [<a
href="#n3">3</a>] In both respects it is stretched beyond
capacity with evident deleterious effect. Lacking the resources
to develop core systems components (e.g. search and retrieval
tools, user interfaces and user profiling services, user
authentication and authorization services, etc.) that work across
individual collections and services, the digital library adopts a
tendency toward a more ad hoc approach that meets the most
pressing demands with bespoke development work. [<a
href="#n4">4</a>] Although viable in the short term, the strategy
cannot scale and threatens severely to undermine a position over
which the library exerts only a tenuous hold - that of the
trusted provider of high-quality information services. [<a
href="#n5">5</a>] Where pure research and development activities
are concerned, the rate and pace of technical change diminishes
the time between the identification of a potentially valuable new
technology and its deployment in a digital library service
environment while the risks and costs associated with any
decision to deploy a new technology remain stable or are
increasing. Accordingly, libraries are investing in more
technologies, more often, and with less information than at any
time in the past.</p>

<p>The palliative measures that are currently on offer are only
partial at best. Mechanisms that encourage greater information
sharing offer some promise, though one cannot underestimate the
severe constraints under which they operate. One can envisage
(can already identify, for example in the Coalition for Networked
Information) forums that allow appropriately skilled
professionals to:</p>

<ul>
<li>inform one another about potentially valuable new
technologies;</li>

<li>share results of any local experimentation with and
assessment of such technologies; and</li>

<li>foster shared experimentation and assessment where
appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>More systematic information sharing requires more formal
exchange and review of the rich technical literature that is
beginning to populate digital library's internal web pages.[<a
href="#n6">6</a>]</p>

<p>Research and development efforts led by OCLC and other
organizations that are grounded in and responsive to the library
community are also promising. Yet one cannot overestimate the
contributions that such organizations can make in an area that
cannot easily be made to sustain itself financially.</p>

<p>Perhaps greater reward will accrue from recent efforts to
delineate which of the panoply of systems necessary to support
digital libraries need to be developed and maintained by the
library per se. Initial investigation into certificate based
authentication, reference-linking, and name-resolution services,
for example, suggest the existence of a class of infrastructural
services that is required by the digital library but more
effectively mounted on an institutional or even
cross-institutional level. In the commercial world, such
high-tech utility services are the stuff of the
business-to-business sector. Encouraging a similar developmental
trajectory for digital library services that are commonly
required but beyond the capacity of any single library
organization to supply would require libraries to articulate
requirements and aggregate demand for such services in order to
create incentives for third party suppliers to move in and supply
the market.</p>

<p><i>Standards and best practices</i></p>

<p>The need for "standards" and "best practices" is universally
felt but so differently defined as to render the objects of
desire almost meaningless. The emergence of guidelines that lay
equal claim to objectivity and authority, a welcomed sight when
only a trickle, begin to compound the obfuscation through their
proliferation.</p>

<p>In this context, it may be helpful to tease out three related
but distinctive needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>for information that helps digital libraries flatten their
own learning curves;</li>

<li>for some community-wide agreement about the minimum level
data creation practices promise to support the library in its
various roles integrating access to, supporting use of, and
managing electronic information content;</li>

<li>for benchmarks that help "consumers" evaluate digital library
collections and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flattening the learning curve is a main source of concern that
can be explained in part with reference to the fact that the
digital library's ambitions frequently exceed its research and
development capacity. Whether launching an initiative to
construct EADs, digitize illuminated manuscripts, or develop
proxy authentication services, the digital library has a natural
inclination to learn from rather than to re-learn the experiences
of others. Satisfying this substantial demand is probably more a
matter of information sharing than some more complex effort aimed
at identifying standards or even best practices. What is required
is not so much prescriptive documentation (how to use the VRA
core) so much as decision tools that guide project planning and
introduce and signpost alternative solution strategies.</p>

<p>Agreement about preferred data creation practices is necessary
to support digital libraries in their efforts to supply services
(e.g. resource location, retrieval, exploitation and, long-term
management, user support, etc) that mediate between end users on
the one hand and extensively distributed, deeply heterogeneous
information content on the other. Diversity of data content is
not tied exclusively to the existence of different data formats
(e.g. raster graphics, ASCII texts, GIS) and metadata schemes
(e.g. the TEI Header, the VRA core, the FGDC) but to the fact
that there are few common implementations of any single format or
scheme. Data resources are typically developed to meet the very
specific needs and interests of particular end-uses (one is all
too familiar with the diversity borne of the phrase "fitness for
purpose"). They rarely take account of the library's needs as an
organization responsible for layering services across a cacophony
of electronic content. The impact on libraries is as considerable
as it is predictable and once again encourages a tendency already
noted toward ad hoc solutions that are developed to meet the need
of specific collections. The more cost-effective and scaleable
approach that relies upon the development of core technologies
requires a greater degree of consistency across networked
information resources than currently applies.</p>

<p>Here, one suspects that libraries would do well to work
co-operatively with one another and with the specialist
communities that develop and implement data creation standards to
articulate the minimum level characteristics they prefer (even
require) for the different classes of information content they
are expected to serve. [<a href="#n7">7</a>] The result needn't
be unduly prescriptive or constrain the idiosyncrasy and
innovation that has emerged as a hallmark of the online
information resources that are produced by or for scholarly
communities. It may also be welcomed by the data creators who
would at least be supplied with some formal statement of those
practices that are most likely to promote access to, and
exchange, security, and longevity of their own content.</p>

<p>Benchmarking is required because digital libraries operate in
a networked environment where they are both consumers and
suppliers of digital collections and services. As consumers they
will want to know, for example, about the quality, persistence,
and longevity of the collections and services that are offered by
commercial third party suppliers of subscription-based journal
content. As suppliers of collections and services, libraries
should expect to confront (and to meet) the same demand from
their own users. Those users include individual to be sure but
also institutions - other libraries for example, which link to or
wish to interoperate with its locally managed collections. As a
supplier of networked information services, it is simply not
enough for a digital library to disclose a collection of
web-accessible images created as surrogates for items in its
special collections, for example. Institutional users will need
to know about image quality, persistence, longevity. So will
scholarly users whose academic endeavors are built in part upon
the ability to identify and relocate information sources.</p>

<p>Benchmarking standards are not, one suspects, a short term
goal. They are more likely to develop as a logical outgrowth of
the other activities that are indicated in this section. Indeed
the developmental path is likely to be an incrementally
progressive one. Exchanging information about current practices
will help flatten the learning curve encountered by digital
libraries as they launch off to develop new collection and
services. By reviewing current practice once assembled, it may be
possible to identify those preferred practices that support the
digital library in its development of mediating services that
work across deeply heterogeneous information content. Comparative
evaluation of those mediating services as they mature may supply
a foundation upon which some benchmarks may emerge.</p>

<p><i>Collection development</i></p>

<p>Had this review been conducted seven, five, or even three
years ago, it might have encountered a more heroic approach to
the development of digital collections. Whether compelled by the
business logic of electronic publishing, the proliferation of
public-domain Internet content, the prospects of enhanced access
to special, rare, and archive holdings, or by an interest in
gaining core competence in key technical areas, libraries were
found enthusiastically creating and acquiring access to digital
information content. Some years on, work in each of these areas
is as enterprising. Enthusiasm for it, however, is tempered by an
equal measure of a reticence that is borne of experience and
reflects concern about cost, longevity, integration, and scale.
One consequently encounters a very real concern to understand
better how decisions to create or acquire access to a digital
resource will impact upon how and at what cost that resource will
be used, integrated into existing library collections and
services, maintained, and supported over time. In effect, one
encounters the earliest stages of what may emerge as a
fundamental revision of traditional library collection policies
and practices.</p>

<p>Such revisionism can only be encouraged even if it transpires
that the same high-level considerations effectively govern the
development of traditional and hybrid (digital and non-digital)
collections. From our present perspective, the differences on
either side of the digital divide are more apparent than the
similarities. For digital formats, the rate and pace of technical
change, the volatility of digital media, and the implications
that access licenses have for collection development and use
forces fundamentally new considerations, for example, of the:</p>

<ul>
<li>costs involved in accessioning a data resource into a
collection (a process that may itself include data reformatting,
metadata creation or amendment, systems design or modification,
development of any documentation that may be required by end
users, public service librarians, systems librarians, etc.);</li>

<li>copyright and licensing issues and associated system
requirements (e.g. to maintain security, process registrations or
payments);</li>

<li>hardware, software, and networking environments that are
required to provide access to a resource and of the stability,
maintenance, and potential migration of those environments;</li>

<li>methods and costs involved in migrating data through changing
technical regimes with as little information loss as
possible;</li>

<li>development and provision of appropriate user support
services;</li>

<li>the impacts that a digital resource once accessioned or
created will have on the work of departments concerned with
cataloguing, licensing and administration, public service, and
library systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here as elsewhere it may be prudent to assemble and critically
assess current practice emerging within those libraries that are
beginning to think strategically and programmatically about
developing their digital collections. [<a href="#n8">8</a>] A
library-based literature already exists to guide the planning and
implementation of digitization projects. [<a href="#n9">9</a>] If
synthesized and supplied with a life-cycle approach that
anticipates how design and implementation decisions impact
longitudinally over time and horizontally across the full range
of library services, it would contribute enormously to any
revision of library collection policy. A similarly systematic
review might be conducted for other components of the library's
increasingly digital collection including for example, the
electronic information that is supplied by commercial third
parties, and the online finding aids and indices including those
comprising links to third-party networked information
resources.</p>

<p>Clearly, the library needs ultimately to allocate its limited
acquisitions budget effectively across a range of very different
information resources including those listed above but also the
more traditional paper-based and analogue formats. In this
respect, it needs collection policies that assist in weighing the
relative short- and long-term costs, benefits, and value that are
associated with very different resource types. Although the
effort described here will not supply that policy framework, it
will provide it with some essential building blocks.</p>

<p><i>Penetrating and mobilizing user communities</i></p>

<p>In a digital library, how information is made, assembled into
collections, and presented online affects whether, to what
extent, and how it can be used. A truism perhaps but one that
marks an incremental step for the library into an arena
traditionally occupied by publishers. The statement is not
intended to re-open a tired and unhelpful debate about whether
the future holds a place for either the library or the publisher.
Rather, it demonstrates how our understanding of a digital
object's life cycle implies a need to engage differently or,
perhaps, just more deeply with our users in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>enhance our understanding of their needs, aspirations and
behaviors as an essential design component of online collections
and services; and</li>

<li>develop appropriate support services.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are at least three additional reasons to place user
relations on a revitalized - perhaps slightly different -
footing. Some user communities that surround the library are
producers of digital content, including research data,
dissertations, e-prints, and computer-assisted teaching
materials. That content has enormous educational and cultural
value, but only if it is assembled into professionally managed
collections, maintained over time, and made meaningfully
accessible to other end users through online portal and other
services. User communities may also possess the expertise or
knowledge that, when applied effectively to existing collections
can substantially enrich and enhance those collections, lending
new meaning to them, even making them accessible or
comprehensible to communities for which they were not initially
intended. In this regard, engaging with user communities is a
vital component of any effective collection development
policy.</p>

<p>Second, some user communities are aware of the tools they
require to manipulate information and are mobilizing, sometimes
on a large scale, to supply those tools - especially where they
are unavailable from the commercial sector. Ask a professional
archaeologist or a geographer about GIS; a musician or engineer
about the manipulation of sound data; an economist, social
scientist or astronomer about the management and analysis of
large-scale statistical data; a medic or a film producer about
the management and analysis of still or moving images. Just as
some user communities are poised as net suppliers of digital
content, others may be in a position to supply tools to a digital
library service environment that can enhance that environment's
functionality.</p>

<p>Third, digital library collections and services represent a
substantial and growing investment by libraries, educational
institutions, and other cultural organizations. Even where there
is no commercial imperative to mount such collections and
services on a cost recovery or revenue-generating basis, there
will be significant pressure to measure performance and value of
investment in terms of use. By engaging with user communities
more effectively, libraries can inform investment decisions by
anticipating their potential benefits (and beneficiaries, where
some financial return on investment is sought).</p>

<p>To re-engage its user communities, the digital library will
work on several levels and in ways that are dictated by purely
local circumstance. Work in at least one area may benefit from
some greater community-wide attention, notably in the development
and application of quantitative and qualitative methods that help
assess users' needs and interests in light of their behavior in
and use of contemporary online environments. [<a
href="#n10">10</a>] Although such methods exist and are being
deployed by libraries to meet some of the their user assessment
needs, there is substantial room for shared activity. Work
co-ordinated by ICOLC testifies to the potential that exists for
such activity, yet it focuses narrowly on the use statistics that
the library community would prefer to gather from its commercial
suppliers. [<a href="#n11">11</a>] The community might benefit
from a similarly concerted undertaking that focuses
simultaneously in two directions: on measures deployed in a
commercial context as a central part of marketing e-services, and
on the use being made of existing library-supplied online
services and collections. Work along the first of these tracks
will require perspective and expertise from outside the library
and academic communities. Work along the second will require some
systematic assessment of existing but highly fragmented
experience.</p>

<p><i>Long-term access to digital information[<a
href="#n12">12</a>]</i></p>

<p>The persistence of digital information remains an essential
challenge for digital libraries. A few are poised to develop
limited archival repositories. Their progress may rely upon the
emergence of two elements that are currently absent.</p>

<p>First, there is no widespread agreement about the minimum
functional requirements of a digital archival repository. Such
agreement is essential. Without defining what maintenance entails
(and thus the requirements of the repository), libraries cannot
tell suppliers of digital content what is needed to preserve the
information. The suppliers need to agree on the requirements of a
repository to satisfy any demand that libraries may make with
regard to that content's persistence. [<a href="#n13">13</a>]
Finally, for emerging repositories to be trusted, whether as
suppliers or consumers of digital content, they require a
blueprint for the services they need to offer and a benchmark
against which their services can be measured and validated.</p>

<p>A second element that is absent from the digital preservation
arena is a more realistic understanding of the value of digital
information. The costs of maintaining digital information over
time are unknown but undoubtedly high. The costs of information
loss are likewise unknown, but the potential costs must be
considered. For example, a drug company maintains data generated
in the development of a new product for as long as those data
have value to the company. Such data might be kept as evidence in
the case of legal action; the costs of not preserving the data
could be ruinous. In this context, preservation may be expensive
but less so than the alternative.</p>

<p>It would be difficult for libraries to make similar
assessments, given their overwhelming focus on commercially
produced scholarly materials (e.g., journals and reference
services). Moreover, because of the number of subscriptions they
hold, it would be unlikely that any single library or library
consortium could take responsibility for preserving such content
over the longer term. Nor does long-term preservation motivate
the commercial supplier. And the commercial supplier's
understanding of "longer term" will understandably be at variance
with that of the library.</p>

<p>Might we begin, then, with digital information for which no
other body is likely to take an archival interest-with the
digital surrogates, for example, that are created by some
libraries? This is not to suggest that all digital surrogates
must be preserved. The UK's National Gallery periodically
re-digitizes its collection of some 2,500 art objects to take
advantage of new imaging technologies. The same strategy is not
necessarily advisable for all, especially those conducting
projects to digitize tens or even hundreds of thousands of
individual objects. The question to be addressed is not only
about the costs of preservation but also about the higher costs
that are likely to be involved in periodic re-digitization.</p>

<p>And what about the digital content emanating from surrounding
academic departments, which makes up an increasing proportion of
the university's intellectual assets? Computer-based research,
learning, and teaching materials have significant value. Yet,
that value is fully realized only if the materials are assembled
into professionally managed collections and maintained over
time.</p>

<p>Admittedly, decisions to maintain the university's
intellectual assets will not be made by the university library in
isolation. The information content that is available from the
university's digital library makes up only one part (a very
important part to be sure) of the university's portfolio of
information assets. To determine its value and the bearable
expense involved in its preservation, the entire portfolio needs
to be reviewed. In the university context, progress in digital
preservation is likely to require institutional ownership of a
far broader preservation problem.</p>

<center>iii</center>

Digital library research and development agendas are not
difficult to come by and I am certain that others will include
more compelling and urgent issues than those I have listed. The
key challenge is in mobilizing effort behind those agendas and it
is here that the digital library, given its commitment to
maintaining legacy services and the dearth of R&amp;D capacity,
faces significant obstacles. Membership organizations have a role
to play, and many are engaged in relevant activities. There are
constraints, however, on what they can achieve. Some have
substantial investment in legacy services that need to be
maintained in a way that limits organizational capacity for
innovation. Others are built and rely upon broad group consensus
that may not always be conducive to the pioneering spirit that is
required. 

<p>The digital library's institutional context presents another
set of obstacles. In the university sector, the digital library
is constrained by the absence of any institution-wide approach to
electronic information and knowledge management. Key
infrastructural components that are commonly required by
administrative, academic, and information service departments
(those associated with rights management and security,
preservation services, aggregating and indexing functions, for
example) are offered on a piecemeal, departmental basis. They are
thus under-resourced (as may be the case for authentication
services), or unsupplied (e.g., with respect to preservation
services). A balkanized approach also characterizes the creation
of educational content, whether construed as online learning
materials, research data, or e-prints. As a result, the content
emerges in such diversity as to hyper-inflate the cost of its
professional long-term management and exploitation. In the
meantime, no single organizational unit within the institution is
be positioned to mount a meaningful defense against the large and
growing number of commercial providers stepping aggressively into
the provision of educational information and services. If, in the
evolving knowledge economy, the university's future is tied to
its ability to capitalize on local intellectual and information
assets, its present approach to information management will
emerge as its biggest, and potentially most debilitating,
threat.</p>

<p>In the higher education sector, the digital library's
challenges are not its own. They belong to its host institution
and need to be resolved at an appropriate institutional level.
Wendy Lougee has persuasively characterized the digital library's
development as a staged, evolutionary process. [<a
href="#n14">14</a>] I would endorse that view and suggest that
the digital library is mature when its activities are woven into
the fabric of its host institutions-when its challenges and its
successes are no longer its own. One suspects that maturation
will require a bold step on the part of the digital library-one
that entails giving up to a higher or broader authority its hold
over strategic planning. Only such an authority will be able
meaningfully to guide the mission-critical activities on which
the digital library currently encroaches.</p>

the library community at large (see <a

Documentation pertaining to digital library developments are
included in a bibliography of technical reports and strategic
documents to become available shortly from the DLF's web

<li><a id="n3" name="n3"></a>The typical digital library will
maintain few if any professional staff devoted exclusively to
research and development activities that are entirely
unencumbered the concurrent need to maintain develop and maintain
operational services. At the same time, access to research
capacity in academic departments is severely curtailed in part
because digital library research applications are perceived as
being less attractive to researching scholars than those with
immediate application in industry, and in part because the
exigencies of producing scaleable, robustk, and stable online
services rarely fall within the researching scholar's purview.
Interesting counter examples exist at several libraries which
have, sometime in conjunction with other departments, established
units with an applied research orientation. Examples include
university libraries at Columbia in its Academic Information
Systems Reseach and Development unit ( <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/group/dlcp.html">http://www.columbia.edu/acis/rad/group/dlcp.html</a>

Berkeley, and the California Digital Library. Here, work is
underway on so-called "middleware" that supplies core digital
library system components.</li>

<li><a id="n5" name="n5"></a>One cannot help but to be astonished
by the persistent failure of academic faculty to recognize the
library as a trusted supplier of high-quality information content

assignment through commercially supplied Internet search engines
