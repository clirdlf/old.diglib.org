<h2>Developing Sustainable, Scaleable, Digital Library
Collections</h2>

<h3>A Publication Series of the Digital Library Federation</h3>

<p>2 August 2000<br />
D Greenstein with T Jewell, L Pitschmann, and A Smith<br />
</p>

<h3>I. Executive summary</h3>

<p>This document describes the aims, objectives, methodology, and
dissemination and review strategy for a DLF publication series
that is intended to synthesize practices (recommending good
practices where possible) in the development of sustainable,
scaleable digital library collections. The document also supplies
a high-level outline for the publication series indicating any
specific emphases of its constituent titles as appropriate.</p>

<p>The series includes three titles each of which focuses on a
discrete type of digital collection including:</p>

<ul>
<li>digital surrogates created from paper-based or other analogue
information objects that exist within a library's
collection;</li>

<li>third-party commercial data resources; and</li>

<li>Internet gateways comprising locally maintained pages or
databases of web-links to third-party public-domain networked
information resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Authors contributing to the series and the working titles of
their reports are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Abby Smith (CLIR), Developing sustainable, scaleable
digitally reformatted collections</li>

<li>Tim Jewell (University of Washington, Collecting Commercially
Available Electronic Resources: Strategies for developing
sustainable, scaleable digital resources.</li>

<li>Lou Pitcschmann (University of Wisconsin), Strategies for
Collecting Free Internet Resources: Selection, Management, and
Funding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. Overview</h3>

<h4>1. Problem that the series seeks to address</h4>

<p>Decisions taken when creating or acquiring access to a digital
information resource impact directly upon how, at what cost, and
by whom that resource can be used, integrated into collections,
maintained, and supported. Accordingly, libraries that are
actively developing digital collections are beginning to develop
formal review procedures that help assess and cost the full
ramifications of their digital collection development decisions.
Such procedures are both well known and well documented where
paper-based and analogue materials are concerned. For those
formats, review may emphasize potential use (demand), cost, and
fit with existing holdings. Review may also take account of
medium- and long-term storage, maintenance, and access
requirements (especially with rare and special collections and
with analogue materials such as sound, film, and video
recordings) as well as any special conservation or preservation
needs.</p>

<p>Although the same high-level concerns may govern assessment of
a digital resource, detailed evaluation will differ considerably
than that which applies to more traditional formats particularly
where information access and maintenance issues are concerned.
Here, the rate and pace of technical change, the volatility of
digital media, and the implications that access licenses have for
collection development and use forces fundamentally new kinds of
review that concentrates, for example, on:</p>

<ul>
<li>hardware, software, and networking environments required to
provide access a resource including investigation into the
stability, maintenance, and potential migration of such
environments;</li>

<li>copyright and licensing issues and any associated system
requirements e.g. maintenance of secure environments, charging
mechanisms, etc.;</li>

<li>methods and costs involved in maintaining access to a
resource over the medium- and longer terms;</li>

<li>development and provision of appropriate user support
services; and</li>

<li>the costs involved in accessioning a data resource into a
collection, a process that may itself include data reformatting,
metadata creation or amendment, systems design or modification,
development of any documentation that may be required by end
users, public service librarians, systems librarians, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formal review of potential data accessions takes on even
greater significance for libraries and other organizations that
have an interest in developing large-scale digital collections.
Increasingly such organizations seek "core" technologies and
services that promise, through their common application across a
range of heterogeneous data resources, to integrate access to and
the administration of such resources. Here the review process
furnishes evidence not only of the likely costs involved in
integrating a data resource into an existing collection but also
of the viability of evolving core technologies and services.</p>

<p>Formal review procedures are as critical given the
departmental organization of most libraries. Where digital
resources are concerned at any rate, collection development
decisions may have substantial impact on the work of departments
concerned cataloguing, licensing and administration, public
service and user support, and with library systems. Formal review
procedures help to predict those impacts and in this respect act
as a substantial aid in work-flow management. They may also
mitigate against having to involve professional departments
across the library in review of every data resource that may be
considered for inclusion in a collection.</p>

<p>Naturally, the need for formal review procedures that can be
applied in the development of digital collection has surfaced a
variety of practices. These are typically available at an
institutional level as guidelines that aid selectors,
bibliographers, digital library professionals and others engaged
in the development of digital collections.</p>

<h4>2. Aims of series</h4>

<p>The series seeks to assemble and review existing digital
collection development practices, recommending any good practices
that emerge from that review. It is envisaged as a series rather
than as a single publication in order that it may take account of
the very different approaches that may be required in:</p>

<ul>
<li>the design and development of local digitization projects
that create digital surrogates for information objects in some
paper-based or other analogue format;</li>

<li>the selection of existing third-party data resources for
inclusion in a collection either through their outright
acquisition or by acquiring access under some licensing
arrangement; and</li>

<li>the development of Internet gateways comprising locally
maintained pages or databases of web-links to third-party
networked information resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Titles in the series are intended to inform local
decision-making rather than to prescribe practice. In this
respect, they are intended as a starting point for the
development of review procedures that are appropriate to an
institution's specific collection development aims and
capacities. In particular titles will:</p>

<ul>
<li>supply decision tools that can be used in developing
sustainable, scaleable and useful digital collections, and can
help libraries assess long-term impacts and costs associated with
such collections</li>

<li>help libraries assess and predict total long-term costs and
other implications that stem from data creation/acquisition
decisions and processes that impact horizontally across the
library's departments and divisions, and longitudinally through
time thereby committing the library to long-term spending e.g. on
data and systems maintenance, user support, etc.</li>

<li>supply information that will help libraries maximize the
educational and cultural value of their collections while
minimizing long-term costs involved for every collection dollars
spent on digital material.</li>

<li>inform collection development policies and influence
collection development practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, the library needs ultimately to allocate its limited
acquisitions budget effectively across a range of very different
information resources including those listed above but also the
more traditional paper-based and analogue formats. In this
respect, it needs collection development policies that assist it
in weighing the relative costs, benefits, and values that may be
associated with these very different resource types. Although the
guidelines intended for publication in this series will not
supply that policy framework, they will, it is hoped, provide
building blocks that are essential in its production.</p>

<h4>3. Methodology</h4>

<ul>
<li>Review and assess existing digital collection development
practices</li>

<li>Conduct interviews with selected library professionals who
are involved in digital collection development to help assess
documented policies, to examine how closely those policies
reflect and inform practice, and to develop illustrative case
studies that may be used in the body of the report</li>

<li>Adopt a life-cycle approach that demonstrates how selection
criteria and collection development processes have wide-ranging
and long-term impacts and costs (e.g. on cataloging, development
and maintenance of library discovery, retrieval, delivery,
authentication, and other systems, on user support, data
preservation, and other library services.</li>

<li>Present reports according to a common high-level outline that
supplies coherence and comparability across the reports and will
assist in bringing the reports to bear collectively on review of
library collection policies generally so that they take account
strategically of both non-digital and digital objects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Audience</h4>

<ul>
<li>Library professionals involved directly in the collection
development activities in question or whose work is impacted in
some way by those activities. An essential goal of the reports in
this series is to ensure there is greater understanding of the
impacts across the library that any collection development
decisions will have.</li>

<li>Academic and student communities, in part because they are
amongst the most important consumers of the library's collection
development activities and as such the greatest advocates for or
detractors from those activities. A further purposes of the
series is to help libraries to stake a credible claim as the
natural place on campus to develop high quality online
educational information services</li>

<li>Senior library and university administrators who need to
respond strategically to the practices identified in these
reports whether through resource allocation or stratetic and
other organizational decisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Different sections of a report may attract attention from or
be targeted at different audiences. Sections adopting a life
cycle approach in evaluating how collection development decisions
impact horizontally across library staff and longitudinally
across time are likely to be of particular interest to library
professionals. A section on cost and organizational implications
is likely to attract attention from senior administrators and
librarians; a section on user support and user services may be
written with an academic user community in view. Introductions
will appeal to all of the intended audiences, signposting for
each what sections of a report they may find to be of
particularly interest.</p>

<h4>5. Publication, dissemination, and review</h4>

<p>Reports will be published online for an initial period of
public review and evaluation. Final drafts that incorporate
comments arising from the review will be published in printed
form and circulated by the DLF.</p>

<p>A review and dissemination strategy will be prepared which
will help to generate community review and endorsement of the
reports and any recommendations arising from them. Activities
included in the strategy may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>establishment of an advisory panel consisting of influential
members of the library and other communities who can inform the
reports' development and assist in their dissemination and
review;</li>

<li>an expert workshop tentatively scheduled for March 2001, at
which reports can be reviewed and their implications assessed for
library collection development strategies more generally;
and</li>

<li>a press release.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Role of advisory group</h4>

<p>An advisory group will be invited to inform the development of
the reports at various stages and to assist in their promotion
and community review. Input from the group will be sought when a
comprehensive outline is available and when reports are made
available for public review and comment. Members of the advisory
group will also be invited to the expert workshop indicated
above.</p>

<h4>7. Outline production schedule</h4>

<ul>
<li>August - production and advisory group review of
comprehensive outline</li>

<li>1 November - comprehensive first drafts circulated amongst
authors for their internal review and comment</li>

<li>1 Jan 2001 -public drafts submitted to DLF for publication,
initiating period of public review</li>

<li>March 2001 - expert workshop</li>

<li>May 2001 - publication of printed reports</li>
</ul>

<h3>III. High-level outline</h3>

<p>The outline will apply across the three research reports whose
particular emphases are indicated where appropriate below.</p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p>Reports will provide an introduction setting the collection
development activity in question in the context of the library's
overall mission both historically and as that mission has changed
through the introduction of online information services and
resources. Introductory materials may also reflect on the
pressures and motivations that shape the library's activity in
the particular collection development areas in question, as well
as the threats or competition it faces from other information
suppliers that have moved into area</p>

<p>Issues that may be considered include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the need for the library to promote itself on campus as a
natural provider of high quality online information services - to
defend its position against commercial suppliers of information
services that have moved into this area encroaching on an area
once almost exclusively monopolized by the library;</li>

<li>the need for the library and the university to understand the
value that the library adds to information content as it develops
high quality on line collections and services - the place
occupied by the library in the market for such collections and
services</li>

<li>the need for the library to tie digital collection
development activities to local mission and imperatives which are
not necessarily clearly articulated</li>
</ul>

<p>Introductions will also highlight themes that recur across
subsequent sections and including library organization,
communication, workflow management, and costs.</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for Internet gateways</i>. Why
selection/creation of digital collections cannot be successfully
based on traditional collection development philosophies and
policies, which are in essence a response to the urgent need in
the 1960s to development multiple research library collections
across the U.S.</p>

<h4>2. Identification, evaluation and selection</h4>

<p>Suggesting processes and criteria that may be used to
identify, evaluate, and select an existing digital resource for
inclusion in a library's "virtual" collection, or, in the case of
data creation projects, to identify, evaluate, and select
analogue objects for digital conversion.</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for commercial
collections</i>. Who identifies resources; how trials are
initiated, organized, conducted, and communicated; whether and to
what extent different types of resources (A &amp; I services,
e-journal packages, full-text aggregator services, literary
texts, etc.) are evaluated or funded differently; how and by whom
licenses are negotiated, drafted, and signed; what issues arise
from different funding and decision-making models including
centralized, collaborative and consortial models; alternatives to
high-priced commercial resources and their impacts on local
collection development decisions and funding</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for Internet gateways</i>.
Assessing intellectual content, format, language (including
character sets and their display, cross-language search and
retrieval, etc), technical issues (e.g. as pertaining to
selection, storage, access, and maintenance and how these issues
influence, if not determine, the scope of the digital
collection); required skill-set for selectors; role and
efficiency of robots/harvesters in searching for appropriate
content</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for digitally reformatted
collections</i>. How and by whom reformatting projects are
initiated and their materials selected; criteria used in
selecting materials; market research (e.g. into audiences,
intended uses), and whether, how and by whom it is conducted;
extent to which different reformatting purposes (e.g. access,
teaching, preservation), impinge on selection decisions; how and
by whom technical specifications for conversion are decided.</p>

<h4>3. Cataloguing</h4>

<p>Outlines issues that need to be considered when evaluating
item- and collection level metadata that is supplied with a data
resource with a view of how, to what extent, and at what cost,
data resources may be made accessible from existing library
catalogues and finding aids</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for Internet gateways</i>.
Assessment of alternatives classification and organization
schemes with particular emphasis on the needs and expectations of
primary and secondary end-user</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for digitally reformatted
collections</i>. Who creates metadata and what criteria are used
for deciding what gets described and to what level of detail</p>

<h4>4. Access services</h4>

<p>How, to what extent, with what functionality, and at what cost
new collection can be made accessible via and integrated with
existing online environments</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for commercial
collections</i>. Representing "paid" resources in online
catalogs; managing different or multiple access paths to
commercial content (via online catalogue, via alphabetical list
of databases or e-journal titles, via topical/subject area lists,
customized, etc.; integrating access to complementary content
supplied by different publishers (e.g. Linking between A &amp; I
services and e-journal packages or aggregator databases),
including consideration of SFX, CrossRef, etc.</p>

<h4>5. User support</h4>

<p>Outlines issues that need to be considered when assessing how
and to what extent digital collections will be promoted and what
level of user support will be required and supplied</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for commercial
collections</i>. Roles and responsibilities of different
university departments (e.g. library systems, campus computing
agencies, reference/public service staff, technical
services/collection development) in staff and user education,
routing and "triaging" help requests, informing users about
terms, limits and conditions of user agreements, and processes
for dealing with infringement</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for digitally reformatted
collections</i>. Role for the library in supporting data creators
as well as users including users including user communities not
originally foreseen at the time of conversion</p>

<h4>6. Collection management and maintenance</h4>

<p>Outlines issues that need to be considered when evaluating
how, to what extent, and at what cost a data resource can be
managed and maintained by the library over the longer term and
remain accessible to library users.</p>

<p>The section will emphasize preservation issues but also any
cost recovery, versioning, or de-accessioning issues that need to
be considered even when adopting a short-term view of collection
maintenance. Cost-recovery issues are most likely to arise for
collections of digital surrogates, versioning issues for Internet
gateways (given the rate at which URLs become obsolete), and
de-accessioning issues for those commercial resources that are
included in a library collection alongside their print-based
counterparts.</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for commercial
collections</i>. Systems and structures used to track "what's
going on" through the selection process, etc.; how usage
information is gathered, interpreted, presented, and used;
evaluation of users' use of e-resources and post purchase product
evaluation; ongoing access to content within discontinued or
cancelled services; de-accessioning electronic content or their
paper-based equivalants</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for Internet gateways</i>.
Strategies for ongoing review, evaluation, modification, and
replacement of highly "volatile" third-party networked
resources</p>

<p><i>Issues of particular concern for digitally reformatted
collections</i>. Differences maintenance issues for preservation
and access collections; levels and terms of access and rights and
access management; long-term costs involved in maintaining
digitally reformatted collections and difficulties in recovering
those costs (e.g. their limited revenue generating potential,
limits to institutional support and on staff expertise)</p>
