<h3>Agenda for a meeting of the collection strategies advisory

<p>D Greenstein<br />
8 January 2000</p>

<p>The meeting will be convened at 2pm on 15 January 2001 in the
Clifton Ford Room of the Jury's Doyle Hotel, 1500 New Hampshire
Avenue, NW. Washington DC</p>

<p>Directions. By Metro to Dupont Circle. The hotel is on New

<h3>1. Welcome and introduction (DG)</h3>

<h3>2. Review of drafts with reference to initiative's aims and
objectives</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Here we will review the drafts to see how far they go in
meeting initial aims and objectives as set out in the framing
document <a href="outline2.htm">Developing Sustainable,
Scaleable, Digital Library Collections...</a>(August 2000).
Amongst the questions we will want to address are the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How far do the drafts go in addressing themselves to the
problem that is stated in this framing document?

<p></p>
</li>

<li>How far do the drafts go in meeting the stated aims? 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>How and to what extent do they address themselves to the
intended audience(s)? 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>How well do they conform to the intended outline? 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>What good practice recommendations can we or should we expect
from the reports? At what level and with what detail should they
be made? 

<p></p>
</li>

<li>How much in the way of bibliography and pointers should we
expect from the drafts?</li>
</ul>

<p>With each of these questions we will want to ask where and how
the drafts AND/OR the initial problem statement need
revision.</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Review of the drafts</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">Although members of the group are
welcome to comment on any aspect of the drafts, we will want to
cover the questions the authors themselves have raised. These
questions are explicitly documented in the drafts themselves. It
would be helpful if those responsible for a detailed reading of a
draft could lead off discussion as follows: 

<p>Janet Gertz, <a href="abby1.doc">Digitally reformatted
collections</a> (Abby Smith, author)</p>

<p>Kimberly Parker, <a href="tim2.doc">Third-party commercial
resources</a> (Tim Jewell, author) (also see <a
href="tim1appa.doc">Appendix A</a>, <a
href="tim1appb.xls">Appendix B</a>, and <a
href="tim1appc.xls">Appendix C</a></p>

<p>Michael Alexander, <a href="lou1.doc">Third-party, public
domain, Internet resources</a> (Lou Pitschmann, author)</p>
</div>

<h3>4. Next steps</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">Again with reference to the framing
document, we want to discuss the drafts' further development and
publication, but also how far we can go (whether in these drafts
or through some follow up work) in identifying, and developing
consensus around "good" collection development practices, and
what process that work might involve.</div>
