<center><h1>Summary</h1></center>

<p>Through The New York Public Library's participation in the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, the Library was able to conduct a detailed investigation
into the issues related to establishing a secure repository for archived
electronic resources in the performing arts.  </p>

<p>The project gave the Library the opportunity to gain a thorough knowledge of the
landscape of electronic publishing in music, theater, dance, and film, and it
also allowed the Library to investigate the special issues that must be
addressed when planning for the long-term preservation of information in
electronic format.  Electronic content that has been the focus of archival
studies and archival projects &mdash; including
work by other libraries participating in the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i> &mdash; has mainly consisted of
lengthy, highly structured and professionally produced journal runs that are
the product of major publishers, most typically in scientific, technical, and
medical fields.  Among electronic resources in the performing arts, however,
few examples can be found that fit this profile.  Instead, these resources are
most typically produced by publishers &mdash; individuals
or small groups of like-minded people &mdash; with
few financial resources who produce only a single title as a labor of love.  
Consequently, the Library took a broad view of the term &ldquo;electronic journal&rdquo;
for its project, although it concentrated on resources that were &ldquo;journal-like&rdquo; &mdash; resources that are produced in a serial
fashion, containing content of interest to sophisticated research by
professionals and scholars.  </p>

<p>Among the project's substantial contributions was the identification of a large
number of such resources currently available &mdash; which
will be of special interest to the field of the performing arts &mdash; and the results of a survey of
e-publishers' responses to issues regarding electronic preservation issues.  
Another major contribution will be of interest both in and outside the field: 
the results of the Library's investigations into methods for gathering
electronic content in a systematic fashion with the purpose of building and
maintaining the archive.  Here, the issues raised will be of interest to
librarians, publishers, and others concerned with preserving electronic
information that is off the beaten path &mdash; created
without the backing of major publishers or academic institutions &mdash; information that is produced outside of
traditional major channels of publication and distribution, the new &ldquo;gray
literature.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Library decided not to submit a second-stage implementation proposal to the
Mellon Foundation, although the Library will continue to explore some more
limited preservation efforts within the framework of a collaborative project
led by Stanford University.  The following report
gives detail on the project's analysis of the landscape of performing arts
electronic resources, work on content development and implementation planning,
and the strategic thinking that went into the decision not to proceed at this
time with an implementation effort that builds directly on the results of the
planning project reported on here.</p>

<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>

<p>Research libraries are concerned to a great degree with preservation.  Today, this
concern extends not only to the preservation of the manuscripts, books,
periodicals, films, recordings, and other materials that line their shelves,
but also to preservation of their intellectual content.  For an archival
manuscript, for example, both the text and the artifact itself are valuable
research resources.  Historically, library preservation has extended to the
physical conservation of archival collections, the preservation of topical
information such as newspapers and journals in the form of microfilm and
microfiche, and the protection of degradable materials through appropriate
environmental controls. However, the increasing production of information in
electronic form has opened up new avenues of exploration in the area of
archival preservation.  Major research institutions such as The New York Public
Library, as well as the electronic publishers themselves, now face the added
challenge of ensuring that electronic scholarly journals and publications
collected by libraries will be accessible to future generations of readers and
scholars.</p>

<p>To this end, The New York Public Library, in response to The Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation's invitation for participation in the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, undertook a planning project that focused on archiving
electronic journals in the performing arts to address the long-term
preservation of these materials.  </p>

<p>The New York Public Library has, from its very beginnings, placed a high priority
on safeguarding all its collections for the future, establishing one of the
first preservation programs in a research library.  Today, the Library hosts
one of the nation's largest such programs and works actively together with
other leading institutions on addressing important issues related to the
preservation of library materials.  </p>

<p>The Library has also shown strong leadership in the application of digital
technology, through a highly sophisticated Digital Library Program now in
development that will make hundreds of thousands of materials from its research
collections available on the Internet.  As part of this program, the Library
has given special attention to the establishment of systems, policies, and
procedures for archiving information in electronic form. </p>

<p>The choice to focus on the domain of performing arts was made for two very sound
reasons: </p>

<p>First, the Foundation's invitation to participate in the Electronic Journal Archiving
Program caused the Library to think in new ways about future readership of
scholarly electronic materials in subject collections that are special strengths
for the Library, such as the dance, music and recorded sound collections at The
New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.  This facility serves a broad
constituency of hundreds of thousands of annual users &mdash; dancers, musicians, actors, playwrights,
conductors, choreographers, stage directors, critics, historians, teachers,
students, and people from all walks of life &mdash; and
has become an unparalleled resource for information in the performing arts.  
While many research libraries have overlapping electronic collections,
especially in the realm of science, technology, and medicine, and a reader is
able to access information from a variety of services, the Library for the
Performing Arts is focused on providing subject-specific materials that are not
widely collected or widely available through a single resource. </p>

<p>Second, the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i> emphasized not only &ldquo;the issues
relating to electronic scholarly journals&rdquo; but also &ldquo;the likely loss to future
generations of scholars of material published uniquely in the electronic
medium.&rdquo;  For the librarians, archivists, and curators who grapple daily with
the challenge of format diversity in written, printed, and recorded materials,
the Foundation's focus on the electronic medium resonated with concerns about
the preservation of non-print materials, which make up a major portion of the
collections in the performing arts, as well as issues regarding electronically
rendered versions of print materials.  More importantly, the Foundation's
project spoke to the developing concern, especially in performing arts studies,
about the preservation of publications found only in electronic format, which
are at significant risk. </p>

<p>Performing arts studies actually offer a relatively small range of scholarly journals
within the confines of the printed form, if one means by &ldquo;scholarly&rdquo; refereed
journals issued by learned societies or through established publishers.  What
is starting to become more prevalent, however, is an interesting universe of material
made available that takes advantage of the multimedia opportunities afforded by
the World Wide Web &mdash; opportunities that have been very attractive both because they appeal to the sense of creativity of
those involved in the performing arts and because of the relative ease with
which publishing enterprises on the Web can be launched. </p>

<p>What can now be found on the Web in the performing arts ranges from very
well-produced, highly structured and highly specialized magazines to informal
tabloid fanzines, full of unedited commentaries, original compositions and
performance reviews, some produced under the auspices of traditional
publishers, and others produced independently.  Rigor aside, all of this is of
tremendous importance to scholars and researchers of the performing arts in
assessing the impact of artists and the creative enterprise on the wider
society.  Not surprisingly, the Library for the Performing Arts has collected,
and continues to collect, this sort of material very extensively, both in
electronic form and in print.</p>

<p>Within the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, The New York Public Library's
focus on the performing arts provided a contrast to the projects of the other
participants, which focused primarily on electronic journals in the fields of
science, technology, and medicine.  In its investigations, the Library
determined that there were significant differences on many levels between
e-journals in these fields and electronic resources in the performing arts.</p>

<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Major issues under investigation</h1></center>

<p>The major issues investigated in the project can be divided into two realms: 
content development and implementation planning for a new electronic archive.  </p>

<p>The Library's first objective was to identify the publishers of electronic journals
and related resources in the performing arts and prioritize them in terms of
their research value.  Building on earlier, preliminary work in preparation for
the project and ongoing work to identify such resources by the staff of the
Library for the Performing Arts, the Library was able to identify a significant
number of performing arts titles.  The Library also began investigating
intellectual property issues and the development of formal agreements with
electronic publishers to cover the respective rights and responsibilities of
both parties in developing a digital archive.  An investigation of the potential growth of the content of
the archive was also undertaken.</p>

<p>Concurrently, the Library was able to
investigate the wide range of technical issues, involving system design, source
and method of content delivery, and hardware and software requirements in its
implementation planning for the archive.  Additionally, the Library considered
potential organizational models and staffing requirements, access policies, and
long-term funding options.  The long-term viability of the archive was also
considered by examining methodologies to validate the archival processes from a
technical perspective and by exploring the means to assure user communities that electronic resources would be
accessible and readable into the future. </p>

<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Project staffing, methodology, and scope of activities</h1></center>

<p>The Library appointed as the Project Officer and principal investigator Jennifer
Krueger, who formerly served as Assistant
Director for Electronic Resources at the Science, Industry and Business Library
of The New York Public Library.  Ms. Krueger carried
out her responsibilities beginning April 2001 and continuing through January
2002, and was assisted by Barbara Taranto, who, as The New York Public Library's
Director of its Digital Library Program, provided general oversight of the
project and who carried out the project's completion
through June 2002 in addition to taking a leading role in investigating implementation planning for
the archive.  Ms. Taranto was appointed the Digital Library Program
Director in February 2001, after previously serving as Systems Coordinator for
The Research Libraries of The New York Public Library.  Prior to this, she
worked as a systems specialist at Mount Sinai/NYU Health Center, which gave her
extensive experience with medical informatics and the long-term preservation of
diagnostic imaging.  Subject expertise in dance, film, music, and theater was
provided by the curatorial staff of The New York Public Library for the
Performing Arts.  Additional input was provided by members of the Library's information technology staff and
also by Dr. Clifford A. Lynch, Executive Director of the Coalition for
Networked Information (CNI), who served as a consultant on this project. </p>

<p>Ms. Krueger, with the assistance of the others mentioned above, conducted extensive
work in the area of content development.  This included an analysis of the
performing arts literature in electronic form, the identification of individual
resources for consideration, recommendations for criteria for inclusion,
investigation into intellectual property issues, and communication with
publishers and legal counsel.  Ms. Krueger also investigated work completed by
other organizations regarding the establishment of digital archives in terms of
content and implementing technology.  (This included, for example, the minimum
criteria established for digital archives by the Council on Library and
Information Resources (CLIR) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF) [<a
href="http://www.diglib.org/preserve/criteria.htm">http://www.diglib.org/preserve/criteria.htm</a>], and electronic
archival implementation done by the European Union-funded Networked European
Deposit Library (NEDLIB) [<a href="http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/">http://www.kb.nl/coop/nedlib/</a>].) </p>

<p>Ms. Taranto conducted further analysis of The investigation of the technological
implementation of the archive.  This included covered the establishment of the means of gathering the
content (or, the &ldquo;ingest&rdquo; methodology), codifying the content so that it would
be readily retrievable, setting storage and retention policies, and developing
a delivery strategy.  Ms. Taranto conducted a detailed investigation into
electronic archive modeling and implementation done by other organizations,
such as the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) (<a
href="http://www.ccsds.org/RP9905/650x0r1.pdf">http://www.ccsds.org/RP9905/650x0r1.pdf</a>) and other work sited in the section on
Implementation, below.  Ms. Taranto worked closely with other participants in
the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i> regarding technical
implementation issues.  Both Ms. Krueger and Ms. Taranto conducted
investigations into the financial requirements of supporting the implementation
of the archive in terms of ongoing content and technology development.  Both
also worked closely with other participants in the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, including Stanford University and the other
institutions working collaboratively on the implementation phase of the program
in the LOCKSS<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> project.</p>

<p>In addition to support for Library staff assigned to the project, funding from The
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided support for Dr. Lynch and other
consultants, as well as travel directly related to the project, including site
visits to institutions involved in electronic archiving.  In addition, the
Foundation's support allowed for the purchase of a server that will be used for
archiving electronic resources on dance in the collaborative LOCKSS project.  A
financial report on the project is included as Appendix A.</p>

<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Content development</h1></center>

<p>The vast majority of information found in electronic form on the performing arts
does not take the shape of peer-reviewed publications and is not the output of
scholarly associations or institutions.  Instead, this information, for the
most part, takes the f0rm of single publications produced by single
publishers.  The intellectual meat of these publications is not stored as
marked-up text, indexed and retrievable through a content management system.  
Neither are there likely to be persistent style sheets, document type
definitions (DTDs) or schemas for storing and rendering output.  For these
reasons the scope of The New York Public Library project was somewhat different
than the scope of other projects in the Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving
Program that were either publisher-based or subject-based, where the content
was produced out of large publishing houses. </p>

<p>Although the Library did considerable preliminary work in advance of the project in
preparing its original proposal to the Mellon Foundation, much less was known
at that time about the characteristics of the electronic publishing base in the
performing arts.  (E-journals in science, technology, and medicine have been
much more widely studied).  The Library's survey of the landscape is a
significant contribution of the project.</p>

<p>The scope of the research for the project was determined by the limitations, both
financial and technical, of the publishers of performing arts content and their
chosen venue of publication. Unlike the large houses such as Wiley and
Elsevier, the domain of performing arts publishers is rather narrow.  
Electronic resources tend to be created, rendered, and stored in a single
system &mdash; often involving a
service provider that is not part of the publishing organization and may or may
not share information about its digital architecture to subscribers of the
service.</p>

<p>Consequently, a major part of the work plan for the project involved analysis of appropriate
candidates for long-term archival commitments.  It was anticipated at the
outset that reaching agreements with these various publishers would be the most
protracted piece of the work.</p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Identifying and prioritizing content</h1></center>

<p>At the outset, it was clear that the audience that was aware of significant
electronic resources in the performing arts was much narrower than the audience that
is aware of scientific, technical and medical (STM) publications and other areas
of academic and scholarly interest that enjoy a wide dissemination.  Partly,
this is due to the fact that, unlike more traditional scholarly publications in
print and electronic form, performing arts publications are not routinely
repackaged by aggregators or indexed in any commercially available resource.  
Consequently, these publications are known and promoted solely on the strength
of their dedicated but limited readership and on the mixed
professional/commercial content of the venue.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  In fact, the
commercial/professional mix of performing arts electronic resources is possibly
the most salient feature of these publications.  It affects every aspect of
their creation, their delivery format and most importantly, their viability.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Library elected to use an expansive definition of term
&ldquo;electronic journal,&rdquo; considering many intellectually significant resources in
electronic form that do not fit the strict profile of e-journals in, for
example, science, technology, or medicine.  Still, the Library restricted its
study to electronic resources that were &ldquo;journal-like&rdquo; &mdash; resources that are produced in a serial
fashion, containing content that is of interest to serious research by
professionals and scholars.  Other significant electronic resources that are
not &ldquo;journal-like&rdquo; such as collaborative performance Websites are very useful
to sophisticated research.  In fact, one of the Library's most highly prized
resources is its Theatre on Film and Tape Archive, which has amassed a large collection
of videotapes of significant professional theatrical productions, the only
complete documentation of many important works extant, including major Broadway
and other commercial productions.  Archiving content found in Websites about
these productions might be something the Library could consider for the future,
but since these resources did not fall appropriately within the mission of the
<i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, they were not included as part of
the project.  Likewise, the Library did not include Webcasts featuring the work
of performing artists.  </p>

<p>The staff of The New York Public Library for the Library for the Performing Arts
has, over the course of many years, developed its own highly prized indices of
various resources in the field.  As a result, with the growing use of the
Internet as a means of quickly and easily publishing valuable resources, the
Library for the Performing Arts began to provide links to external online
resources on its public Website  (<a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/online.html"> http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/online.html</a>).  
The effect of this was two-fold:  new and important information was made
available to the public and new and important information was brought to the
attention of the Library staff by their Web readership. Professionals,
researchers, and publishers of serious performing arts journals solicited the
Library's interest in the new venue. The Library began to investigate,
evaluate, and ultimately propagate certain trusted publications in the
performing arts community.  This accumulated index of invaluable print and
electronic publications is one of the richest resources of the Library for the
Performing Arts.  It represents years of research, study and consideration on
the part of the Library's professional staff and its governing agencies.  The
various indices are available in toto in the various divisions of the Library;
a subset of these are available on the Web.  These seasoned lists formed an
important starting point for the project. </p>

<p>A relational database was created for the project to log the entries and to
record specific information about each of the publications.  Site URL's were
examined for &ldquo;freshness,&rdquo; and live sites were recorded and entered into the
database.  A brief description of the content was included in the database and
special note was made regarding the number of pages deep into the site a
visitor needed to go in order to get to the meat of the content.  It is
important to note that the substance of performing arts electronic resources
can often be buried deep beneath layers of advertisements, job postings,
auditions, professional service listings, etc.  Finding the content was a
significant part of the discovery process.</p>

<p>Once recorded, the entries were analyzed and sorted into three primary categories: 
sites that were content-light, sites with significant content that needed to be
mined by readers, and sites where the content was transparent &mdash; that is, where the content could be
readily uncovered, and not buried several layers deep within a Website.  The
first category was eliminated from further inquiry since, for the most part,
the information was contemporary in nature, including vendor information,
instruction, workshops, etc. and were only relevant for current use.  
Consequently, despite its usefulness to the current performing arts community,
it held little appeal or use for future researchers and scholars. </p>

<p>The set of e-journals that formed the core of the content considered for the
project reflected a variety of formats of presentation and organization of the
content across the disciplines of dance, film, music, and theater.  (The list
of titles compiled and Web addresses are included in Appendix B.)</p>

<h2>Inclusion criteria</h2>

<p>Not every Web publication in the area of the performing arts may be appropriate for
inclusion in an archive.  The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System
(OAIS), the set of organizational principles adopted in the project by the Library,
requires that a statement of policy or, at the very least, a set of inclusion
criteria be established in order for the archive to be built in any sustainable
mode.  Establishing a set of criteria based on this model is most often done by
an advisory board consisting of scholars, professionals, representatives of
arts organizations, and librarians from the user community. This mechanism
serves double duty.  It provides a solid network of individuals who help shape
and review selection criteria and arbitrate on issues when necessary.  It also
guarantees a level of &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; from the stakeholder community, an essential
component of all large enterprises, and one that is sometimes undervalued.  </p>

<p>To reach the stage of establishing a Review Board for the planned archive, the
project team compiled a working list of titles for inclusion.  This refined
list was drawn from the original titles that were culled from the Library for
Performing Arts' listings of online and paper resources.  These resources fit the
following criteria: </p>

<ul>
<li>they were consistent with the current collection development policies of the Library,</li>
<li>they had identifiable publishers,</li>
<li>they consisted primarily of original content, </li>
<li>they were persistent in terms of publishing schedule and format, and </li>
<li>they were media rich.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the electronic publications that were selected had to contain the first four 
of these qualities, and a strong emphasis was given to those that met the final
criterion.  </p>

<p>Although certain other criteria, such as a publication's importance in the field and its recognized authority or longevity, were desirable it was determined that
including these criteria would rule out candidates that were not
well-established, but were worthy of consideration nevertheless. This is not to
say that these attributes counted against inclusion, but they were not
considered necessary for inclusion.  Some of the titles under consideration had
ceased to publish on the Web or anywhere else, for that matter; the abiding
interest in these publications was their obvious status of being at imminent
risk of being lost for future research.</p>

<h2>Consistency with the current collection development policies of the Library</h2>

<p>The subject area of the performing arts was chosen as the focus of the project in
part because of the collection strengths of the Library and in part because of
the concentrated wealth of knowledge found among the professional staff at the
Library for the Performing Arts.  For the project, this staff drew from their
expertise about the nature and long-term stewardship of collections and helped
evaluate potential electronic resources with regard to the Library's collection
development policy.  By extension, the electronic archiving project was the
natural and inevitable next step for the Library to make in its long-term
strategy to conserve and preserve its materials, and it made sense that the
content of the titles nominated were well within the bounds of the Library's
current collection practices.  The staff evaluated titles individually, and
resources such as "Critical Musicology" (<a
href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Info/CMJ/cmj.html"> http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/Info/CMJ/cmj.html</a>),
for example, which fell within the policy, were identified as candidates for
preservation and subject to further evaluation, whereas Web publications such
as "CDNOW: Allstar News" (<a
href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/pagename=/RP/ALLSTAR/main.html">http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/pagename=/RP/ALLSTAR/main.html</a>), which is primarily a
commercial site with no content other than an inventory of products, were not
considered further. </p>

<h2>Identifiable publisher</h2>

<p>One of the many challenges of dealing with small publications, and especially
publications on the Web where the means of production can be entirely in the
hands of a single operator, is the problem of identifying and locating the
person, persons, or agencies responsible for it, an important matter in terms
of intellectual property and rights aggregation for rights clearance. Simply
finding a name, corporate or personal, claiming to be the publisher of a site
is no guarantee that the agent identified has any legal standing in regard to
its content.  Many Web publications, and especially those in the performing
arts, &ldquo;crib&rdquo; material from other sites, (see "beat thief," <a
href="http://www.beatthief.com/">http://www.beatthief.com</a>) or are complex sites
that welcome un-vetted participation from their readership (see "oobr," &ldquo;the
off-off-Broadway review,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.oobr.com/">http://www.oobr.com/</a>).  It is not so much
that the publisher does not control the content or disavows the content, but
that the publisher may not know, at any given time, the nature of the content,
or may not be completely responsible for &mdash; or
capable of &mdash; content management. </p>

<p>The ad hoc practices and behaviors of some electronic resources in the performing
arts may be their most salient and attractive feature, but the problems
presented by these practices make it close to impossible to &ldquo;collect&rdquo; the
titles for an archive in any meaningful way.  While an agreement might be made
with one party involved in the publication, another party may not be reachable
or may object to the arrangement.  In some cases, where a single agent can be
identified, it might very well be that he or she has no clear right to publish
the content.  This is especially true of electronic resources that provide a
substantial amount of streamed media, such as music or film clips.  While the
text of the site may be the intellectual property of the author/publisher, the
media illustration is often not. </p>

<h2>Primarily original content</h2>

<p>It was considered essential that electronic content consist of original
information generated by the publishing source and not information that was
repacked from some other source.  The legal ambiguities are considerable for
re-published digital content generated somewhere other than its primary source
which may take on a different format<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> because of bandwidth
limitations and service provider restrictions, even if materials are &ldquo;born
digital&rdquo; (see "Soundout," <a href="http://www.soundout.net/">http://www.soundout.net</a>).  Print publishers,
media companies, film studios, and others all have a stake in how evolving
copyright legislation in an electronic environment is drawn and enacted.  Until
such legislation can address some important issues, what amounts to &ldquo;buying or
licensing&rdquo; digital rights is unclear, at the very best, and risky, at its
worst.  Consequently, electronic resources that required extensive legal and
monetary negotiations regarding intellectual property were not considered for
the project.  </p>

<p>Copyright issues are not necessarily insurmountable.  However, work in obtaining legal
rights to content in many performing arts electronic resources has the
potential to turn into a legal quagmire. Even if the content is highly
desirable, the cost of doing due diligence on the variety of conditions under
which the content might be archived and delivered could far outweigh the
benefit gained by preserving the material.  Dealing with purveyors who have
clear title to materials or at least could indemnify the Library from any
liability where rights have not been cleared was considered absolutely
necessary.  </p>

<h2>Publishing persistence </h2> 

<p>The initial list of performing arts titles consisted of a very wide range of
e-publications including many that had substantial content but would generate,
with more than occasional frequency, the disappointing message &ldquo;unavailable.&rdquo; 
To be fair this was more likely to be the fault of Internet service providers,
rather than the publishers, and in the current economy service providers have
been known to retire with little or no notice, leaving their customers in
difficult straits.  Still, publications that could not be accessed with some
consistency were excluded from consideration.</p>

<p>Planning to archive any serially published materials is most readily done through the
establishment of close relationships with the publishers of the content.  There
is obviously an extensive lead-time required to set up the legal and technical
parameters for deposit, and some of the proposed sites failed to conform to any
manageable or predictable schedule of publication. </p>

<p>Other publications in the course of a few months continuously re-invented their
sites, changing basic organizational formats<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>, changing intellectual
direction, and changing the targeted audience.  Still others discontinued
publication (see "Inhaler," <a href="http://www.darkshadow.com.au/inhaler">http://www.darkshadow.com.au/inhaler</a>) even though it was
clear from the &ldquo;hit&rdquo; counter that the site was still actively used.  Overcoming
the issues raised by dynamic content is a technical challenge that will be
addressed later in this report, but in place of either persistent schedule or
persistent intellectual format, the Library ruled out these publications for
inclusion in the archive. </p>

<h2>Media rich</h2>

<p>The project's focus on the performing arts provided the potential to explore the
issues raised by electronic publications with embedded multi-media objects.  As
noted, nearly all the titles under consideration contained some form of
non-text material.  The amount of audio-visual media included was significant,
but lower than anticipated; 45% of the titles contained sound and/or video
formats.  Some publications, such as "African Music Archive" (<a
href="http://ntama.uni-mainz.de/~ama">http://ntama.uni-mainz.de/~ama</a>) and 
"Ethnomusicology Research Digest" (<a
href="http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/ReadingRoom/Newsletters/EthnoMusicology">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/ReadingRoom/Newsletters/EthnoMusicology</a>),
had a wide range of content including archived audio, streamed audio, and music
performance.  "African Music Archive," however, offered its readership mime types
and browser-compatible formats, while Ethnomusicology Research Digest relied on
the ingenuity of its user base to download and then reformat binary objects
into human &ldquo;readable&rdquo; files.  The probability of successfully archiving
standardized formats such as Real Media or QuickTime is much greater than that
of archiving idiosyncratic media types. The ingenuity of the site publisher is
manageable with human intervention, but daunting when planning an archive based
on automated systems for ingest, storage, and retrieval. </p>

<p>The vast majority of e-publications containing media objects did not venture into
unusual file types or file types unique to the performing arts, such as
MIDI-based musical material, or computer-based dance notation which would represent specialized and complex
preservation issues, or areas of uncharted technology involving &ldquo;new media.&rdquo; 
(Here, the term &ldquo;new media&rdquo; refers to new types of electronic formats, not new
types of performance [see "Music by Light," <a
href="http://www.itp.nyu.edu/nuweb/GALLERY/music_light.html">http://www.itp.nyu.edu/nuweb/GALLERY/music_light.html</a>].)  For certain types of performing arts sites
that cannot be easily classified as e-journals or e-zines, there may be a
potential audience for such new media, but for the purposes of the project
these titles, or sites, were not considered for inclusion in the archive.<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> </p>

<p>Almost all of the titles that were under review included some form of non-text
content.  Approximately 85% of the electronic resources contained images and
graphics beyond that which could be described as organizational logos or
publication mastheads, and these resources clearly presented issues for concern
regarding intellectual property rights.  In the area of music and recorded
sound, a further 45% of the listed titles contained various forms of audio
media.  Some of this content was available as MP3 files, some as QuickTime.  
Many sites that were considered, such as "Taktlos" (<a
href="http://www.nmz.de/taktlos/index.shtml">http://www.nmz.de/taktlos/index.shtml</a>),
provided numerous streaming excerpts from radio broadcasts, live performances,
and discussions with musicians, composers and reviewers.  Aside from the
copyright issues involved &mdash; which may or may not be
covered by formalized waivers given the legal standing of the publisher and the
publisher's ability to clear the rights with all parties involved<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> &mdash; the technical challenges this presents
were not insignificant.  Streamed media, whether it is audio, video or Webcast,
presents special considerations for archiving that have not been much explored.  
These formats, including Real Media files or QuickTime files, in fact
constitute a third-, forth-, or sometimes even fifth-generation derivative of a
digital source.  In many cases, the digital source is itself a reformat of an
analog recording.  That aside, streamed media is not delivered as a &ldquo;unit.&rdquo;  
It is pieced out across the telecommunication pipeline in sizeable,
downloadable chunks. Streamed media requires browser plug-ins and local
transmission-speed configuration files in order to be rendered properly on the
desktop.  Unlike other binary objects that can be harvested directly and stored
in an archive, streamed media published on the Web is not so much a digital
object, as an event.  It certainly can be reproduced locally, but it could not
be easily harvested.  In addition, some sites offer multiple streams of the
same material at different levels of quality (where higher quality streams
would be selected for recipient sites with higher bandwidth connections to the
net), raising additional considerations.</p>

<p>Despite the challenges that media-rich resources present, it was felt necessary to give
some priority to these resources in identifying potential content for the
archive, specifically in order to address such challenges.</p>

<h2>Further refining the subject focus</h2>

<p>At a certain point in the project, as the number of potential electronic resources
grew while, at the same time, cost projections for maintaining the archive were
being developed, it appeared necessary to narrow the subject focus of the project
if there was to be a hope of taking it to an implementation phase.  The key
strategic consideration used in narrowing the field was to emphasize congruence
with existing programmatic commitments at the Library.</p>

<p>Of the titles that remained after the process of elimination based on the five
criteria noted above, the majority of them fell into one of two areas:  music
and dance.  The music titles were by far more electronically sophisticated than
most of the dance journals, but several raised significant rights issues and
the likelihood of coming to mutually agreeable terms for access with publishers
and artists was not encouraging.  Furthermore, the music resources, while more
established and containing more content than some other publications, did not complement
the subject emphasis of the specialized collections of the Music Division at
the Library for the Performing Arts. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the 30-some dance titles that survived the initial cut were
more in line with the goals the Library had set for itself at the onset of the
project. The dance titles, which are listed in Appendix C, can be characterized
in the following ways: </p>

<ul><li>Journals were published both nationally and internationally;

</li><li>Most types of dance and movement performance were represented;

</li><li>Publications were split roughly between &ldquo;born-digital&rdquo; editions and &ldquo;digital facsimiles&rdquo; of
hard copies;

</li><li>Publishers were identifiable and locatable;

</li><li>Media clips, both sound and vide, were found in many publications;

</li><li>New content, for the most part, was still published as &ldquo;issues&rdquo;; and 

</li><li>Most publications were currently offering past issues that have been &ldquo;archived&rdquo; on
their respective sites.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Another factor that was taken into consideration was the comparatively limited number
of institutions and organizations focused specifically on dance research and
scholarship &mdash; The New York Public
Library for the Performing Arts being one of them. The Jerome Robbins Dance
Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts is highly
respected both nationally and internationally and is considered to be one of
the most reliable and rich repositories of materials on dance anywhere in the
world.  The Library is a founding member of the Dance Heritage Coalition and
hosts the Coalition's Website (<a href="http://www.danceheritage.org/">http://www.danceheritage.org</a>). Given the leadership
role the Library's Jerome Robbins Dance Division takes among dance libraries,
it is quite likely that the Library might be the only organization that could
consider taking on a major role in establishing an electronic archive for
dance. </p>

<p>Considering this, the Library was in a good position to leverage some of its existing
relationships in the dance community to help solicit participation and solidify
commitments with publishers.  Given this and the special nature of the dance
e-publications, the Library made the decision to focus its efforts &ldquo;narrow and
deep&rdquo; &mdash; providing strong depth of coverage in the very specific subject of dance.</p>

<p>By focusing on dance titles the Library believed it could accomplish significant
understanding of the process involved in collecting, storing and delivering
electronic content that was not already normalized in some other system.  The
challenges predicated by the diversity of document types, media types, and publishing genres were well represented by the dance titles selected. </p>

<p>While, in a perfect world, it would be best to be able to archive as much electronic
content as possible, it was felt that developing an archive containing a modest
number of electronic resources on dance would make a contribution to both the
dance field and electronic archiving. The challenges for archiving this
material are obviously quite different from the challenges of archiving large
numbers of regularly generated text files from content management systems.  But
given the range of participants involved in the <i>Mellon Electronic Journal Archiving Program</i>, it appeared that certain issues of scale were going to be
addressed by other parties, and the Library would make its most significant
contribution by exploring areas not particularly relevant to the STM-type
archive.</p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Publishers' roles in an archive</h1></center>

<p>The success or failure of an archive depends in large part on the good will and
cooperation received from the publishing community.  For obvious reasons, the
archive would be content-less without the publishers' material, but more
importantly, without the good will of the parties involved, there are no
grounds for negotiating or resolving issues as they arise.  </p>

<p>This was a lesson learned and generously shared with the participants in the Mellon
Electronic Journal Archiving Program by the team at PubMed Central, at the
National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.  While PubMed's experience was most obviously
applicable to the Mellon program participants working in science, technology,
and medicine, the experience was also applicable to the performing arts and
other fields.  </p>

<p>Dr. David Lipman, Director of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information at the National Library of Medicine, and his programming team
shared the various technical challenges involved in ingesting material from a
wide variety of scholarly publishers, many of whom are small, single-title
entities like those found in the performing arts group.  In some cases, months
of negotiation were necessary between depositors and PubMed Central before an
actual document was submitted to the archive.  Most of this time was spent on
the development of a DTD for ingest.  Some time, however, was lost in trying to
work with publishers that were less than enthusiastic, thinking that with
enough technical and professional support from the National Library, the
publishers would be more receptive to the requirements of the archive.  </p>

<p>Dr. Lipman reported that after 18 months, working with a range of titles, they had
come to the conclusion that the only viable arrangements were those where the
publishers' involvement was entirely voluntary.  Trying to win interest in the
project could not be had by any technical incentive.  And the possibility of
providing a financial one was slim.  </p>

<p>These lessons were valuable ones for The New York Public Library in dealing with
publishers in the performing arts.  It should be noted, however, that the PubMed
project was operating in a very different milieu than the performing arts,
where it is only a small exaggeration to say that publishers cannot even afford
backup disks.  Performing arts publishers are typically very aware of the need
of preserving information, but any reluctance on their part to participate with
regard to financial considerations must be cast in a very different light.  
Such publishers, it was found, were supportive of the development of an
archive, and clearly saw the benefits in the possibility that the Library might
be able to offer server space and the technological wherewithal to make an
archive come about. </p>

<p>For many of the publishers of the electronic resources in dance<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> considered by the
Library, the Web is the only publishing medium; no print copy exists.  Approximately
80% of these e-journals and e-zines are currently providing their own online
archive, subject to the terms of their Internet provider and the amount of
space each can afford to maintain and expand upon with new content.  (In some
fields, as an attempt to underwrite this service, past issues, which are often
indexed by issue date, may be searched by registered readers or by paying a fee
to the publisher.)  </p>

<p>Publisher-based archives are far from stable, however, as we have witnessed from the almost overnight
disappearance of rather successful electronic publications such as "Friends of
Photography" (<a href="http://www.friendsofphotography.org/">http://www.friendsofphotography.org</a>)
and the original "Time Digital," (continued in a very different form as 
"On Magazine,"  
<a href="http://www.onmagazine.com/on-mag/">http://www.onmagazine.com/on-mag/</a>) among
others.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>  Unlike some of their
more broadly based cousins who might withstand the loss of an electronic
presence, dance e-journals have neither the means nor the wherewithal to assure
the public that the on-line archives will persist. </p>

<p>The short-lived nature of Web editions and the economic realities of producing art
publications argue for some degree of receptiveness on the part of the
individual publishers.  Consequently, when the Library took a straw poll of
e-publishers in February 2001, it was not entirely surprised by the positive
response.  A sample of twelve publishers was selected and each one felt that
their audience would find the archive useful.  All but one expressed interest
in the development of an electronic archive; the lone dissenting publisher
expressed concern, with little explanation, about losing advertisers due the
establishment of the archive.  Regarding the idea of making the archive freely
available, eleven of the twelve responded positively and also felt it would be
unnecessary to limit access for any period of time after publication.  All but
one of the publishers were willing to have content from their Websites
harvested by the Library or other archive administrator, although only half
were willing to provide files of Web content directly for storage.  Seven of
the twelve responded that they allowed their site to be crawled by such
resources as Google or the Internet Archive; the others did not know or did not
respond.  On a question regarding storage, the publishers indicated that the
file size of their individual publication issues ranged from seven to 100
megabytes.  Ten of the twelve indicated that they planned to increase multimedia
content, although a few noted that this might take years.  </p>

<p>The illustration on the following page provides a matrix of possible relationships
between publishers and The New York Public Library.  The publishers'
participation ranges from the most active &mdash; where
the Library receives everything it wants, when it wants and how it wants, with
no cost and with total control over delivery &mdash; to
the publishers having no participation at all and the Library essentially
adopting a &ldquo;risk management&rdquo; approach to archiving content.  When publishers
have no formal agreement and the content is freely available on the Web, it may
be tempting to harvest sites until an objection is raised.  And while this may
not be ideal, it is perhaps the only way to handle some of the more elusive
candidates.</p>

<p>However, this last arrangement seems to be the least tenable and the least desirable.  
It is somewhat akin to a collection development policy based on taking what you
can get and not what you want. </p>

<p>In any event, whatever the relationship that is formed between the Library and the
e-publishers, (and of course there will be easier negotiations with some and
not with others) the terms of ingest for any given title will have to be
determined rather specifically if the content is ever to make it to the
archive.  Trawling for content may sound like a simple solution (and even
roguish), but it does not answer the bigger questions of what to do with it
when it is brought home. Neither does it address the issues raised by content
that includes streaming media, which cannot be readily harvested in this
way.  </p>

<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Implementation planning</h1></center>

<p>Shortly after initial work began that focused on
the potential content of the electronic archive, the Library engaged in a
separate parallel planning investigation on the archive's implementation, work that
proceeded concurrent with the analysis of content, with the two processes
informing each other along the way.  </p>

<p>To implement a viable electronic archive there are three key components that must
be in place (following the OAIS model):  an ingest methodology, a storage and
retention policy, and a delivery strategy.  In addition, of course, systems and
infrastructure components to make all of these operational will be needed.</p>

<p>The Library gave relatively little consideration to delivery issues, and these will
not be discussed further, other than to note that it appears that many of the
other STM-based planning projects were operating in an environment where the
archive would, at least in the near term, be largely &ldquo;dark.&rdquo;  Given what we
learned from our discussions with publishers in the dance area, an archive of
this material would be mostly &ldquo;light&rdquo; (fully accessible to the public)
immediately; indeed, the archive at The New York Public Library might well be
the only source for back issues of some dance publications, given how critical
the lack of storage space is to the publishers, and how eager they are to shift
responsibilities for archival backfiles elsewhere.  Thus, the Library's project
would have to fully address delivery issues as part of any initial
implementation, not as a future follow-on to ingest and storage functions.</p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Ingest</h1></center>

<p>The situation for ingest of performing arts publications is clearly radically
different than that which applies to the STM publications that were the focus
of many of the other Mellon planning projects.  There is no hope of contracting
for a well-structured Submission Information Package (SIP) which would be
delivered from the publisher.  The publishers don't have the technical
capabilities or resources to do this, and their content is simply not created
and managed in forms that are amenable to such a model. </p>

<p>In many ways, pure harvesting is probably the most practical model for ingesting
content from performing arts publishers.  However, there are numerous problems
with this approach.  It would be necessary to build a base of highly
tailor-able, error-checking, adaptive harvesting software that could detect new
materials, discard irrelevant content, potentially deal with streamed media
components, navigate sites, and similar functions.  While the Internet Archive
and other groups such as the Research Libraries Group (RLG) have made a start
on establishing such a technology base, it is far from ready for use in a
closely quality-controlled digital archiving environment.  There are also
problems in modeling what is being harvested; one would like to collect
incremental new content &ldquo;units&rdquo; (such as journal issues) rather than a
succession of images of a Website, but many of the publisher Websites simply
aren't organized in this fashion. </p>

<p>Ideally, the Library's hope going forward would be to use pure harvesting as a last
resort, and to seek to negotiate some form of structured harvesting or
publish/subscribe model with the sites being archived, where they stored new
material in some organized way that made it easy for the Library to harvest or
otherwise extract new materials.</p>

<p>Metadata is clearly another problem for the ingest strategy.  A small amount of metadata
can be created computationally &mdash; the
site, file details, the date of capture, etc. &mdash; but most of the materials published in dance are not
published with well-structured bibliographic or other descriptive metadata that
could be incorporated into a Library- generated SIP from the publisher Website
without extensive human intervention. </p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Retention and storage</h1></center>

<p>Based on the examination of what was actually being done in electronic publications
in dance and the performing arts more broadly, it was possible to establish a
few preliminary strategies for retention and storage. </p>

<p>The digital images of what was captured would be kept permanently, available to at
least support digital archeology as a failsafe against the limitations of format migrations.</p>

<p>The main strategy for avoiding technical obsolescence over time would
be file format migration.  The evidence was that there were a fairly small
number of relatively mainstream file formats that comprised the vast majority
of the dance materials.  There seemed to be only minimal need to deal with
specialized digital formats (e.g. MIDI, structured dance notation, etc.) which would
call for specialized strategies.  The preservation focus would be on content
rather than on trying to retain &ldquo;look and feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The largest unresolved problem in the retention and storage area revolved around units of
archiving; typically what would be dealt with would be complexes of files,
somewhere between capturing a well-structured bundle of files and capturing a
series of images of a Website with opaque structure, and dealing with this
tension in both ingest and storage would be a critical problem going forward.  
The discipline of editions and units of publication are not very well followed
in the dance and performing arts literature, and this creates an enormous
problem when compared to the STM literature.  This is an important finding from
the Library's analysis.  In the STM literature there is (at least to a first
approximation, leaving aside details such as the listing of editorial boards
and editorial policies) a well-established intellectual model of the objects
being archived and these objects are clearly manifest in the process of
producing an STM journal.  In the performing arts publishing world, by
contrast, no such consensus on base intellectual models of objects to be
archived exists in a visible way within publishing practices.  This represents
a sizeable technical hurdle to be overcome.  Another
way of viewing this finding is that while the STM literature has closely
emulated the practices of print journal publications in its transition to
digital form, the performing arts digital literature is much less closely tied
to such traditions.  This creates a surprisingly serious problem in developing
archival strategies.</p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Economic models and sustainability</h1></center>

<p>The literature of the performing arts, as already discussed, is resource-starved.  
The only economic model that could be realistically devised would be a
philanthropic partnership, where the Library might lead a consortium of
interested institutions (perhaps building on existing organizational structures
such as the Dance Heritage Coalition) that would work in close collaboration
with the publishers to establish and maintain a lasting archive of publications
in the field.  This would be primarily a fully accessible archive that would be maintained
as a public good.  For a very small number of participating publications, it
might be appropriate to use some form of &ldquo;moving wall&rdquo; archival policy for
determining when material is made accessible (similar to that used in JSTOR),
but the titles for which this would be applicable would be a small minority. </p>
<hr width="75%" />
<center><h1>Implementation decisions</h1></center>

<p>As the work on the planning project drew to a close, the Library had identified a
relatively small core of electronic publications in dance for which the Library
might mount or lead a digital preservation effort closely aligned with existing
programs and priorities.</p>

<p>The economics of this potential program, however, were deeply problematic.  An
ingest system would require either very extensive software development which would
be hard to reasonably amortize over the small number of serials involved, or,
alternatively, a more limited software development effort supplemented with an
extremely staff-intensive (and hence operationally costly) ingest system. There
seemed to be little likelihood, at least in the immediate future, of being able
to build upon other software development work in this area &mdash; the other Mellon planning projects, for
example, were identifying development priorities that were very different from
those that would be required for performing arts literature.  A much more
extensive ingest program covering many more sources would lower the per-journal
ingest cost, but would mean a larger storage and retention effort, and a much
more extensive and costly scale of negotiation with content producers.</p>

<p>In terms of storage and retention (and perhaps delivery), an archiving program for
dance literature could share common infrastructure and systems with an
institutional asset management and archiving system, since much of the work
would be in managing and migrating a fairly small number of key file types.  
However, at the Library such an institutional system was not yet in place.</p>

<p>During the period of the Mellon planning project, the Library had been involved in an
extensive organizational evaluation and planning process that had as its goal
the transition of digital library efforts (collection selection, digitization,
management, delivery and stewardship) from a project-based framework to a
permanent, systematic, institutionally based operational framework.  This would
include the establishment of large-scale, sustainable infrastructure components
which might be shared by a program to maintain &ldquo;published&rdquo; material in the
performing arts (once ingest had been accomplished).  However, it was clear
that the Library was at least another year away from putting a fully developed,
reliable, production infrastructure in place to support its own programs to
manage internally generated content. There are also deep and
complex organizational questions about where to position such
functions within the Library's organizational units and how to fund the
activities; the debates around these issues are ongoing, and challenging.</p>

<p>Since it was clear that digital preservation in the area of performing arts serials
would be an ongoing investment (an expense) rather that a revenue-generating or
even self-sustaining activity, it seemed clear to the Library's management that
this was not the time to move forward on such a digital preservation program.  
Instead, the better strategy seemed to be to focus on developing institutional
infrastructure, and then to return to the question of investing in programmatic
extensions in the performing arts which encompassed digital preservation goals
in a year or two, after the institutional infrastructure was established.  Even
at that time, however, it seems likely that only a larger-scale preservation
program underwritten by a consortium is likely to be viable just focusing on
the costs of establishing ingest systems.  It is useful to note here that even
if other Mellon archiving projects produce some type of community storage
repository, the ingest problems for performing arts e-resources represent a
formidable economic and technical barrier to exploiting such a community
resource.</p>

<p>As an interim measure, the Library has chosen to participate in the LOCKSS program
along with a number of other institutions.  While this is not a full
preservation solution, it allows the Library to gain some experience with
highly distributed redundant storage as an infrastructure component, and also
to continue to explore some of the ingest issues that will ultimately need to
be addressed.    </p>

<center><h1>Notes</h1></center>
<div id="ftn1">

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>
The LOCKSS project is developing a decentralized electronic archive, based on
the fundamental principle that electronic files are more secure when multiple
copies of these files are stored in several locations.  Put another way, &ldquo;lots
of copies keeps stuff safe&rdquo; &mdash; this is the
basis of the LOCKSS acronym.</p>

</div>

<div id="ftn2">

<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>
Performing arts electronic resources are rarely a compilation of scholarly
articles. Advertisements are often embedded in text and commercial interests
openly sponsor some features. See <a href="http://www.actingbiz.com/">http://www.actingbiz.com/</a></p>

</div>

<div id="ftn3">

<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> MPEG becomes Real Media, TIFF files become
GIF or JPEG files, etc.</p>

</div>

<div id="ftn4">

<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a>
Format in this case means something different from style or layout or mime
type, referring to whether the publication is a single author site, a
cooperative site, an electronic forum, etc. </p>

</div>

<div id="ftn5">

<p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a>
It is important to note here that embedded media is in some ways no more
challenging than any type of electronic content. Unusual or non-standard text
formats present similar ingest issues. Archiving PDF documents or NB documents
require ingest protocols and standardized classification schema in the same way
media objects do.  The difference here lies in the rather more complex delivery
methods required for media, and consequently the more complex and detailed
metadata that must be gathered at the time of ingest.  It may be desirable to
deliver text in the format and presentation style it was originally rendered;
however, it may turn out to be of no intellectual consequence to the
publication in question. On the other hand, media content must be rendered with
some verisimilitude. The content in this case cannot be extracted from its
form.
</p>

</div>

<div id="ftn6">

<p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a>  The preferable solution is to require
publishers to sign an indemnity waiver, stating that they hold the (digital)
right to the images in question and that the archive will be held blamelessshould a dispute arise.  Such a waiver may pose problems for publishers who
have no knowledge of how early editions of the publication were created and
publishers outside the United States for whom different legal obligations
apply.  In instances where the publisher does hold the right to an image, a
place holder may have to be inserted, perhaps describing the image and
providing information to locate the image elsewhere.  Copyright and performance
rights issues could occur with audio clips.  The waiver mentioned above would
need to cover all instances of intellectual property, including these.  If
rights issues cannot be satisfactorily negotiated with the publisher, recourse
to the individual rights holders may prove to be to daunting due to the
numerous individuals involved.  For a title whose content otherwise is
desirable to retain, place holders may be needed.</p>



</div>

<div id="ftn7">

<p><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a>
Statistical sampling shows that perhaps as much as 70% of performing arts
journals are only found in digital format.  Another 10% include material in the
electronic version that is never published on the paper issue.  See for
example:  <a href="http://www.backstage.com/">http://www.backstage.com/</a>.</p>

</div>

<div id="ftn8">

<p><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a>
Currently there are many e-journals facing imminent closure. See:  <a
