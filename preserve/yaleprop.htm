<h1 class="sectionhead">PROPOSAL FOR A DIGITAL PRESERVATION COLLABORATION</h1>

<h3>between The Yale University Library and Elsevier Science</h3>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>10 October 2000</p>
</center>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>1. ENDURING ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC JOURNALS. Authors,
publishers, and librarians all feel it is imperative that assured
long-term access to electronic journals be provided. The inherent
mutability of information technology, a rapidly changing
marketplace for electronic publishing, and the absence of any
well-established preservation practice for electronic information
make the prospect for long-term access most doubtful. Until we
have successfully addressed this issue, scholarly communication
will remain bound to print and paper because with these formats
we can assure long-term access to traditionally published
scholarly information. This is a costly and dysfunctional
bondage, where electronic publication otherwise serves scholarly
communication decidedly better.</p>
<p>The Yale Library and Elsevier Science regard the long-term
access to electronic journals as mission critical. We feel that
both organizations have vitally important, complementary
capabilities to bring to a digital archives project. Our
experience in negotiating licenses leaves us feeling confident
that we respect one another's institutional imperatives and value
the human talent in both organizations that must be engaged in an
archival project. We believe we will be able to manage genuine
differences in our organizational missions and cultures in a way
that will allow us to work in close collaboration on our shared
concern for digital archiving.</p>
<p>Assured access to electronic journals embraces a variety of
activities that might usefully be grouped in three categories,
each distinctively driven by:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>The circumstances of ordinary commerce</u>. Included here
are access arrangements (such as mirror sites) designed to deal
with ordinary telecommunications, time zone, and redundancy
needs. This category also includes arrangements for responding to
extraordinary emergencies (such as massive equipment failure,
damage done by hackers, etc.).</li>
<li><u>Likely changes in publishing</u>. The Yale Library and
Elsevier Science recognize that some arrangement must be made to
ensure enduring access to electronic content in the face of
changing commercial circumstances. What should be done when some
substantial part of a publisher's content is no longer
commercially viable (the digital equivalent of going "out of
print")? when a publisher sells a particular journal, ceases
publication of one or more titles, bundles material in
significantly different ways, or disengages from a certain line
of business? when a publisher is sold or goes out of business?
Such changes in a company's commercial circumstances pose grave
threats to enduring access to its publications. In an enterprise
as volatile as publishing now is, we should expect many such
changes in any 10-20 year period.</li>
<li><u>Traditional archival needs</u>. In the very long term (100
years+), most readers will address questions to an archive of
Elsevier Science publishers unlike the questions of today's
practicing scientist. These questions will normally be of a
historical character, and they will be addressed to an archive
structured in ways that are especially responsive to historical
inquiries. These questions will reflect the intellectual
paradigms of the future, which can hardly be predicted
today.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>The term "archiving" has been applied somewhat
indiscriminately to all of the situations where assured long-term
access to electronic journals is needed. Elsevier Science
provides for timely, uninterrupted access to its electronic
publications as a part of its ordinary business. The publisher
has its own telecommunications capabilities and back-up
arrangements in place and is exploring additional arrangements
with national libraries and local-load customers to guard against
more damaging emergencies. Recognizing these arrangements, the
Yale Library and Elsevier Science propose to take action on the
two other access needs identified above.</p>
<p>We seek funds from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for a
year-long effort to plan our archive in detail and to create the
test-bed computing capabilities needed for that planning.</p>
<p>2. DEFINING THE SCOPE OF A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT. The Yale
Library and Elsevier Science intend to work collaboratively in
the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The library and Elsevier Science both wish to understand the
ordinary commercial life cycle of scientific journal articles so
that we might create an archive that protects readers from the
failures of access that are likely to occur in that cycle. We
believe that the competitive, commercial marketplace can be a
highly efficient way of providing access both to individual
articles and aggregations of them (say in journals or in still
larger databases). We also believe there is a time when the
marketplace will no longer support access to some part of a
publisher's output. This point in time will vary immensely from
article to article, from journal title to journal title, from
discipline to discipline, etc., and neither publishers nor
librarians yet know enough about the online environment to
predict confidently when this time will come. But everything in
our experience suggests that continuing always to burden
commercially viable content with content that is not, or that is
only marginally viable, robs us of the economic efficiencies of
the marketplace. So burdened, a publisher is likely to change its
business plan or, in the extreme case, go out of business. These
are points of great risk for scholarly communication, as the
ordinary uses of the threatened journals may become unsupported.
We must develop an archival practice that guards against this
danger.</li>
<li>The library is interested in working with Elsevier Science to
support ordinary archival uses of that company's journals
published electronically. Responding to well-established patterns
in the use of archival collections, our archive will be designed
to support two principal kinds of inquiry, both of them
significantly unlike the needs of the practicing scientists that
Elsevier Science journals are created to support. These are (1)
inquiries into the scholarly, business, technical, and policy
environments within which Elsevier conducted its publishing
business; and (2) inquiries that treat archival information in
transformative ways. Inquiries of the former sort usually draw on
a wide variety of resources and are sometimes possible only after
confidential or commercially sensitive information in an archive
can be opened for study. Inquiries of the latter sort usually
address subject or disciplinary interests unlike those that
originally prompted the publication of the material in the
archive. Such inquiries typically require some reconfiguration,
re-assembly, or re-purposing of the archival information (often
in conjunction with other archival holdings). There is no way
confidently to predict what these archival inquiries will be, who
will make them, and when they will be made. The most likely
prediction about these archival uses, judged by other archives,
is that they will be relatively infrequent initially but will
increase over time as the scholarly value and integrity of the
archive increases.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>3. DISTINGUISHING CONCEPUTALLY BETWEEN CONTENT AND
FUNCTIONALITY. In the print world, intellectual content and the
physical presentation of that content (including, for instance,
indexes and elements of graphic design) are immutably linked in
discrete, time-bound publications. Whole intellectual
disciplines, such as descriptive bibliography, have developed
around this fixed relationship between content and its physical
embodiment (the elements of which are sometimes referred to as
paratext features). In the digital world, no such immutable links
exist. Indeed, readers positively expect the presentation of
content to change, in the form of new system functionalities that
enhance use. But at the same time, readers are most uneasy with
the thought that the intellectual content of electronic
publications might change in ways unknown to them. Readers insist
on the authority and authenticity of digital content but welcome
changes in functionality.</p>
<p>The Yale Library and Elsevier Science, observing this striking
difference in reader behaviors in the print and digital worlds,
wish to test the viability of archival services based on a
fundamental distinction between the "content" of the scientific
articles Elsevier publishes and the "functionality" provided to
readers by Elsevier at any given point in time. We believe this
distinction may be critically important in setting and meeting
reader expectations about digital archives, in devising technical
strategies for meeting those expectations, and in controlling the
long-term costs of archival services. We have therefore made the
distinction a central feature of the exploratory planning we are
proposing to the Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>We define content as the data and discourse about the data
that authors submit to the publisher, along with other
discourse-related values added by the publisher's editorial
process (e.g., revisions prompted by peer review, copy-editing).
We define functionality as a set of further value-adding
activities that do not have a major impact on the reader's
ability to understand content. So understood, functionality
embraces a very wide spectrum of things, from graphic design to
search engines, and from branding or aggregating practices to the
provision of links among related materials. Functionality has
most to do with reader productivity (e.g., the ease and
efficiency, or even the pleasure of use). Functionality is not
linked to individual content but is pervasive to large bodies of
content. In posing this distinction, we recognize that the
boundary between content and functionality may not be crystal
clear in every circumstance. It is likely to vary at any given
time as one moves from one disciplinary literature to another,
from one publisher to another, and from one journal to another.
It is also likely to change over time, as technology evolves.
While we recognize this significant variability, we also believe
that the distinction is inherent to digital technology and is
likely to figure centrally in any viable archival strategy.</p>
<p>More specifically, we believe an archive of electronic
journals must unquestionably preserve and provide access to the
journals' content, as here defined, over very long periods of
time (i.e., 100+ years). Users of the archive must feel confident
they are seeing the data and discourse the author and publisher
agreed to publish, and not some other version of the work (e.g.,
a pre-print) or versions of the work corrupted by non-authorial
intrusions. By contrast, we hypothesize there is no comparably
important idea of archival functionality. Authors, readers, and
publishers alike expect functionality to improve over time and
independently of any specific content. There is rarely a
compelling interest in maintaining earlier functionality (except
where there is a failure to improve, as for instance when changes
in functionality threatened access to content). And while it is
certainly possible to imagine archival inquiries that turn on the
functionality provided by the publisher at a given point in time,
one might well wish to archive functionality separately and in a
manner different from content.</p>
<p>Similarly, because archival inquiries are unlike those that
shape the business practices of the publisher, the functionality
offered by the publisher may not be what would best support
archival use. Indeed, if one accepts that much archival use is
unpredictable and requires the repurposing of archival materials,
any idea of a single "authentic" functionality may be a barrier
to effective archival inquiry.</p>
<p>4, TECHNICAL MEANS FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CONTENT AND
FUNCTIONALITY. Technically, how might an archive of Elsevier
Science journals separate content from functionality and ensure
the authority and authenticity of the former for the long
term?</p>
<p>In addressing this question, we distinguished among four
fundamental representations of content carried in digital bits
and bytes.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Alphabetic, symbolic, and BLOB codes</i>. Digital bits and
bytes encode alphabets and symbols, using ASCII and Unicode
conventions, and a variety of digital objects, using BLOBs (i.e.,
binary large objects). BLOBs are used to encode tables, images,
multi-media objects, etc. ASCII code is one of the most stable
features of the digital environment because it is so basic and
flexible, because it is used so pervasively, and because it
represents massive sunk-costs. It makes economic sense to focus
archival effort at this level of coding.</li>
<li><i>Document codes</i>. While more recently developed, SGML
and related document codes (representing many paratext elements)
are a second fundamental level of coding that is essential to
create meaning from digital bits and bytes. We expect document
codes to be relatively stable and for that reason to be an
appropriate target for archival effort.</li>
<li><i>Metadata</i>. Metadata relating to a given document is a
particularly important category of encoded information. Standards
for such metadata are now being developed, with the intention
that such information will remain relatively stable in the
otherwise fast-changing digital environment. Metadata will be
particularly important to and an appropriate target for our
archival effort.</li>
<li><i>Rendering software</i>. The library as an archival agency
must provide its readers with the ability to render alphabetic,
symbolic, BLOB, and document codes into a form that can be read
and used. Today, a number of choices present themselves,
including OpenText, Science Server, and IBM's Digital Library.
Other choices will no doubt present themselves in the future. It
is possible that some rendering software will be more effective
in supporting a particular line of archival inquiry than others.
Especially given the unpredictability of archival inquiries, it
will probably be important that the alphabetic, symbolic, BLOB,
and document codes be renderable by a number of different
software packages.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>5. CREATING A BASIC ARCHIVE. Elsevier Science is able and
willing to provide the Yale Library with SGML versions of nearly
all of its current journals (c. 1,100 titles). The availability
of back files in SGML form varies, with significantly less SGML
material being available for pre-1998 publications. Other digital
formats-including TIFF and PDF-wrapped TIFF files-are available
for pre-1998 material. Elsevier Science does not wish to provide
and the Yale Library does not wish to use for either of the two
services described here the full online functionality offered to
Elsevier customers. Elsevier Science will, however, provide to
the archive all of the metadata it creates. In its simplest
conceptual terms, therefore, our agreement is that Elsevier
Science will provide the content for the archive (i.e., the bits
and bytes coded for rendering alphabetic and other symbols,
BLOBS, documents, and the metadata associated with this content),
while the library will provide rendering software and the
computing environment for its use.</p>
<p>In creating that environment, we will draw on the inherent
advantages for archiving of a multi-tired client/server
architecture supported by a mass storage archival system. Tier
three of the system will provide database management
functionality where the content will be stored in a RDBMS, ODBMS,
or a file system. Tier two, our middleware, will provide process
management software. We are drawn to the archival management
software being developed at the San Diego Super Computer Center
and at the Harvard and MIT libraries (our partners in the
Northeast Library Consortium, or NERL) to manage the intake,
object naming schemes, validation, access management, and other
tasks that must be performed at this tier. The design of the
these tiers will be informed by the InterPARES Project, a leading
effort to develop the knowledge required for the permanent
preservation of digital records, and by the standards for digital
archives being advanced by the Council on Library and Information
Resources and the Digital Library Federation. Tier one of our
archival system will provide a user interface, in the form of a
web server-browser, to request, render, and display data from
tiers two and three.</p>
<p>The content and computing architecture just described will
constitute a digital archive capable of meeting the two most
essential archival responsibilities. These are (1) preserving the
documentary content published by Elsevier Science and the
evidence of provenance relating to that content, and (2)
supporting a wide range of largely unpredictable inquiries
against that content and its provenance.</p>
<p>At the same time, we intend to design our archive to be
technically capable of meeting the ordinary, non-archival
information needs of readers should (or when) commercial
circumstances prompt Elsevier Science to change its business
practices in ways that imperil access to its content. The Yale
Library and Elsevier Science will identify a set of specific
circumstances in which the library's archive will become the
means of ordinary access to Elsevier Science journals. These will
include the business changes identified above, such as when parts
of the publisher's content becomes commercially non-viable, when
publication of a title ceases, when the publisher substantially
changes its line of business, etc. The Yale Library and Elsevier
Science will establish agreements governing the intellectual
property affected by changed circumstances such as these. We will
also describe the computing environment that the Yale Library
will provide to support ongoing access and the latitude the
library will have for non-profit business arrangements that might
improve the provision of access. Both collaborators will
publicize their agreement on these matters, to inform authors and
the wider library community about the steps we are taking to
ensure that enduring, long-term access to our archival content is
certain.</p>
<p>The Yale Library already has substantial experience in working
as trial local-load customer of Elsevier Science. This experience
prompts our interest in a preservation project, and we are
particularly glad to have the strong support of the Elsevier
Board of Directors for this project. Though we will provide an
archival home for only one publisher initially, considerable
variety in the size and content of Elsevier's publications
ensures that our technical design will be generalizable and
scalable. Moreover, we believe the example of a successful
project with one of the world's most important publishers of
science journals will be influential when we approach other
publishers, later, and when other libraries and publishers
consider collaborative action on archiving. Finally, the archival
profession urgently needs some highly visible success stories
regarding digital content. The ready engagement in and commitment
of Elsevier Science to this project will be important factors in
our success in planning and implementing archiving services.</p>
<p>6. A DEVELOPMENTAL ARCHIVE. Although we feel confident about
our ability to design a digital archive able to meet basic
archival responsibilities and provide against an important set of
commercial contingencies, many questions will remain about the
good design and management of a digital archive. In our initial
discussions, the Yale Library and Elsevier Science have
identified the following questions as important to both of us. We
expect to refine, refocus, and prioritize these questions and to
identify others during the planning phase of our project.</p>
<p><i>Questions bearing on the technical design of the
archive</i></p>
<ul>
<li>How persistent will the coding conventions be for alphabets,
symbols, BLOBs, documents, and metadata? Are there real economic
advantages in making these canonical codes the focus and basic
building blocks of our archival work?</li>
<li>A significant part of what Elsevier Science has published
digitally exists now only as TIFF and PDF-wrapped TIFF files, and
not in SGML. Should this material be included in the archive,
even though the more basic coding is not available? This question
points to a yet more fundamental one. What do we regard as the
most reliable document for archival purposes? Is it a particular
rendering of the document (a TIFF file, for instance) or is it
the underlying content coding that can be rendered in a number of
different ways?</li>
<li>What are the limits of our ability to separate content from
functionality? These two are so closely linked in much software
design that we will surely encounter areas in which the
separation cannot be made without some jeopardy to the integrity
and utility of the archival record.</li>
<li>What should the archival record of functionality be and where
and how should it be maintained? In what measure is the
provenance of functionality more closely bound to the publisher's
corporate archive than to the content itself?</li>
<li>What options for data rendering and other middleware software
do we have? Do any of these options meet archival purposes
better? Do any promise to be more robust for those cases where
the archive must substitute for the normal, commercial means of
access?</li>
<li>What resonance does our proposed separation of content and
functionality have with thinking within the digital preservation
community about migration and emulation strategies? Does either
strategy become decidedly more or less attractive given this
separation?</li>
<li>How does one test the reliability over time of the archive as
a means of reader access to its digital content?</li>
<li>Significant differences in media stability and storage
capacity suggest there may be a significant choice to be made
between tape or compact disk technology for our storage medium.
How do these trade-offs bear on our ability to contain the cost
of media migrations over long periods of time?</li>
<li>Our focus on the fundamental alphabetic, symbolic, BLOB, and
document codes assumes relative stability in those codes, some of
which are just now being developed. It may be that over very long
periods (100+ years), even these basic codes will change so much
that emulating them or migrating through their changes will be
formidably expensive, especially in light of presumably
infrequent use of archival material. Given this possibility,
should we explore a technically bi-modal archiving strategy that
preserves the content (not the functionality) as digital output
to microfilm, which could be reconverted to digital format on
demand where that re-conversion was appropriate for a particular
archival inquiry? If there is merit in such a bi-modal approach,
how would certain information (e.g., color images, video and
audio material) be handled?</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p><i>Questions relating to changes in commercial
circumstances</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Can we anticipate some kinds of commercial change and manage
them proactively? For instance, can we identify a set of ordinary
uses of Elsevier Science content that can or should be segmented
because they pose distinctive commercial challenges? Should we
actively plan for different commercial strategies to maintain
access to current materials (including, say, material published
in the last 5 years), recent materials (e.g., material published
6 to 15 years ago), and older materials (e.g., published more
than 15 years ago)? At some point, access to infrequently used
material will not be profitable and will burden the commercially
viable parts of the publisher's business. How can we measure and
understand such information life cycles in a way that serves both
the commercial needs of Elsevier Science and the access needs of
readers, where those needs diverge? Are there technical or other
operational synergies among a publisher's profitable services,
its emergency back-up services, and the not-for-profit operations
of an archive that can be invoked to manage through this
information life cycle?</li>
<li>What resources-human, technical, and financial-will be
required to sustain the archive indefinitely over time? What
contribution will Elsevier Science make, as the creator of the
archival material, toward meeting these resource needs? What
contribution will the Yale Library make as an archival agency?
What contribution would other libraries, which depend on the
existence of the archive, make? Are there points in the life
cycle of Elsevier Science publications where marginal revenues
might be realized but might not justify the commercial effort
required to earn them? If so, might these revenues be used to
help support the cost of archival operations? (A rough analog is
the way some university presses are now using mid-list books that
are no longer sufficiently profitable to attract trade publishers
to build income to support traditional scholarly
publishing.)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p><i>Questions about the utility of the archive</i></p>
<ul>
<li>What view will authors take of the proposition that the
digital coding of their documents, rather than a particular
rendering of those codes, constitutes the archival record of
their work? More generally, what view will authors take of the
systematic differentiation between content and functionality that
we propose? These same questions need to be posed to users of the
archive as well.</li>
<li>When commercial changes shift readers away from the
commercial services of Elsevier Science to the archive, in accord
with our agreements, will a technical structure appropriate for
infrequent archival inquiries adequately support possibly more
frequent ordinary use? In such circumstances, the archives
middleware and telecommunications capabilities may not be
appropriately scaled and they may not offer some functionality
important to readers. How will these issues be addressed, and
what not-for-profit business arrangements might be instituted to
solve problems of scale that arise in such circumstances?</li>
<li>What kinds of inquiries will be made of the archival record
we create? Are we right in predicting they will be sufficiently
infrequent, <i>sui generis</i>, and involve such transformative
uses of the record that they pose no attractive commercial
opportunities for Elsevier Science? Can the library maintain a
fully open (or "bright") archive that responds usefully to
archival inquiries but does not seriously threaten the commercial
interests of Elsevier Science? More broadly, what demand for
related archival resources will an archive of journal content
create? What impact will our content archive have on broader
records management and archival practices within Elsevier
Science?</li>
<li>How do the costs of maintaining a digital archive of Elsevier
Science publications compare with those of maintaining a print
version of the journals to ensure long-term preservation and
access? In considering this cost differential, how should we
appraise the capabilities of digital publishing that cannot be
replicated in print?</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p><i>Questions that may affect the strategic direction of
Elsevier Science</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the likely difficulty in some cases of disengaging
content from functionality, are there things that Elsevier
Science might do in the design of its current and ongoing
business process to facilitate that separation? That is, in what
ways can its commitment to good archival practice become a source
of strategic direction for Elsevier Science?</li>
<li>The metadata provided by Elsevier Science will be the primary
testimony to the provenance of the documents in our archive. How
adequately do these metadata represent the processes by which
Elsevier Science conducts its business and creates a public
(i.e., a published) record of scientific communication? Are
additional metadata required? Here again, in what ways might its
commitment to good archival practice become a source of strategic
direction for Elsevier Science?</li>
<li>Is there provenance information about the documents in our
archive that might best be maintained in a separate corporate
archive? For instance, is information about editorial board
membership for a given journal best kept in our archive of
individual published documents or in a corporate archive of
Elsevier Science? Where should the archival record of the
functionality Elsevier Science created and delivered to its
customers be kept, in both the near and long term?</li>
</ul>
<i>Doomsday question</i> 
<ul>
<li>Acting alone, the best that any publisher can do to ensure
enduring long-term access to its content is to make credible
arrangements to transfer that content to a library, should
commercial circumstances make that necessary. This is true of
Elsevier Science as a commercial publisher, just as it is true of
JSTOR, the nearest we have today to a trusted third-party agent
for preservation and access. There are, however, no agencies to
which libraries can hand off their preservation and access
commitments, should they need to. Is there anything that can or
should be done about this fact? Is there anything about this fact
that has changed with the emergence of digital technology? Is
there anything that can or should be done now to protect the
preservation mission of libraries against the pressures created
by other parts of their mission?</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>7. INITIAL PLANNING ACTIVITIES. Few of the questions posed
above can be usefully explored-either by the Yale Library and
Elsevier Science or by other investigators-unless we actually
create a digital archive. There follows an outline of the
planning steps we will take over a year's time to create a
digital archive for the journals published electronically by
Elsevier Science. An italicized statement at the end of each
bullet indicates the sequence and duration of our planning
activities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide (for at least initial implementation) on the content
of the archive. Will it include TIFF and PDF-wrapped TIFF files
as well as SGML files? Will it include a variety of editorial
matter (names of editors, instructions to authors, copyright
policies, etc.) as well as content created by authors? Will the
archive include advertisements appearing in the print versions of
the journal? Does the archive require any metadata beyond what
Elsevier Science now routinely creates? Will the archive include
ancillary indexing and abstracting services or free information
resources now created by Elsevier Science? The decisions we make
on these issues need not be regarded as definitive or final.
Indeed, we may wish to make different decisions on some of these
matters for various parts of our archival file, so as to test the
utility of our initial answer to these questions. <i>First
quarter.</i></li>
<li>Establish initial agreements regarding intellectual property
and other business practices that will govern the archive as the
means of supporting ordinary use of Elsevier Science content when
changes in commercial circumstances make that necessary. <i>First
quarter</i>.</li>
<li>Acquire and deploy the test bed computing hardware and
software needed for the archive of Elsevier Science publications
described above. Explore the willingness of software developers
to provide their products to us for short-term testing and
development activities at no cost or at below-market rates.
During the planning year, only a test-bed level of capability
will actually be deployed. Production level capabilities would be
created in the follow-on demonstration project. Nonetheless,
planning would attend carefully to questions of operational
efficiency and to questions of scale as regards the initial size
of the archive, its growth over time, and the requirement that
the archive be capable of supporting some approximation of normal
use should commercial changes require the archive to support such
uses. Decide whether the archive will support more than one
capability for rendering the encoded material of the archive.
<i>First and second quarters</i>.</li>
<li>Devise and implement prototype procedures to ensure both the 
reliability of the archive's content (i.e., it faithfully
represents the editorial and publishing activities of Elsevier
Science) and its authenticity (i.e., material in the archives
persists without change, except such changes initiated and
documented by the archive as part of carrying the material
forward through time). These activities and those in the next
bullet will require substantial travel and consultation, to
ensure that our project takes full advantage of the archival work
being done at other NERL partner libraries and by R&amp;D
laboratories elsewhere. <i>First and second quarters.</i></li>
<li>Devise and implement prototype methods by which the
operational stability and reliability of the archive can be
tested periodically. The object here is to create a solid record
of access, for both archival and normal inquiries, that leaves
the community served by the archive confident of its technical
reliability. <i>Second quarter.</i></li>
<li>Devise and implement prototype methods to register and assist
readers pursuing archival inquiries, comparable (where
appropriate) to those used in print archives. Devise and
implement service quality improvement procedures that use our
experience with readers to improve the archive. <i>Third and
fourth quarters.</i></li>
<li>Develop a fully-detailed technical, service, and business
plan for the creation of an enduring archive of Elsevier Science
publications. Design this plan so that it might accommodate the
journals of other publishers. <i>Third and fourth
quarters.</i></li>
<li>Continually revisit, refine, and refocus the questions posed
in the previous section. Restate them as appropriate and begin to
devise the methodologies that may be used for addressing them,
giving special attention to those that bear on the long-term
sustainability of preservation and archival functions. <i>All
four quarters.</i></li>
<li>Prepare project announcements and reports, as appropriate,
for the Mellon Foundation; for the publishing, library, and
digital preservation communities; and for authors writing for
Elsevier Science publications.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
 
<p>8. PROJECT STAFFING AND BUDGET.</p>
<p><i>Staffing</i>. Scott Bennett (Yale University Librarian) and
Ann Okerson (Associate University Librarian) will co-direct the
project, drawing on their substantial experience in scholarly
publishing, preservation, copyright, and licensing. They each
expect to devote not less than 5% of their annual effort to the
project. They will in fact devote whatever time is required to
ensure the success of the project.</p>
<p>Karen Hunter (Senior Vice President, Elsevier Science) will
direct the Elsevier Science part of the project planning effort,
drawing on her distinguished record in scholarly publishing and
on her career-long liaison work with academic libraries.</p>
<p>Paul Conway (Head of the Yale Library Preservation Department)
will be the project manager. He will devote an estimated 40% of
his annual effort to the project, drawing on his internationally
recognized expertise in preservation and digital technology and
on his demonstrated project management skills. Working under the
direction of Scott Bennett and Ann Okerson, Paul Conway will keep
the project team focused on the completion of its tasks in a
timely fashion. He will provide the project with daily
coordination, leadership energy, and staff support; he will draft
most of the project documents.</p>
<p>The project will hire a systems officer to lead in specifying
the technical environment needed for our archival work, to
explore alternatives for creating that environment, and to build
prototype elements of our system. We expect to employ a systems
officer already working at Yale, to ensure familiarity with the
institution and a prompt start for our project. Practically
speaking, it will probably not be possible to release the
full-time effort of a senior systems officer for this project.
Preliminary conversations suggest we can secure the majority of
such a person's time, along with the efforts of others, to give
us a strong team with a wide range of expertise and the
equivalent of at least a full-time appointment.</p>
<p>Project personnel have substantial experience in defining and
negotiating licenses for intellectual property. Yale's Office of
the General Counsel has been both thoughtful and generous in
supporting this work when that has been needed. We believe this
tested team approach will meet the project's need for legal
counsel during the planning year.</p>
<p>While it is likely the project will need the services of a
business planning consultant, the nature, scope, and cost of
those services cannot realistically be predicted now. It seems
best to rely on the University Librarian's Discretionary Funds
for this purpose. </p>
